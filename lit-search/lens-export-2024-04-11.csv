This package aims to facilitate the use of Bayesian models for paired comparison data in behavioral research. Bayesian analysis of paired comparison data allows parameter estimation even in conditions where the maximum likelihood does not exist, allows easy extension of paired comparison models, provides straightforward interpretation of the results with credible intervals, has better control of type I error, has more robust evidence towards the null hypothesis, allows propagation of uncertainties, includes prior information, and performs well when handling models with many parameters and latent variables. The bpcs package provides a consistent interface for R users and several functions to evaluate the posterior distribution of all parameters to estimate the posterior distribution of any contest between items and to obtain the posterior distribution of the ranks. Three reanalyses of recent studies that used the frequentist Bradley-Terry model are presented. These reanalyses are conducted with the Bayesian models of the bpcs package, and all the code used to fit the models, generate the figures, and the tables are available in the online appendix.",54,4,1,21,Bayesian probability; Statistical model; Data mining; Frequentist inference; Estimation theory; Null hypothesis; Type I and type II errors; Computer science; Latent variable; Posterior probability,Bayesian paired comparison; Bradley-Terry; Davidson,"Bayes Theorem; Humans; Matched-Pair Analysis; Models, Statistical",,Chalmers University of Technology,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-021-01714-2.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-021-01714-2 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2101.html#abs-2101-11227 https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11227,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-021-01714-2,34846675,10.3758/s13428-021-01714-2,3216602291,PMC9374650,0,000-499-525-775-294; 001-196-876-979-000; 001-298-764-371-292; 004-107-553-174-752; 004-414-436-917-174; 004-536-668-580-211; 005-221-425-379-679; 005-542-264-252-155; 006-508-995-763-511; 008-385-491-458-383; 018-269-445-638-29X; 024-483-744-410-492; 025-009-658-071-875; 025-133-922-650-453; 027-151-451-153-494; 029-039-079-169-352; 029-409-571-804-501; 036-214-652-015-794; 036-464-850-968-184; 041-706-379-743-767; 045-187-870-348-998; 045-191-659-606-690; 047-005-506-445-938; 047-665-680-465-014; 050-033-593-645-124; 050-701-869-637-24X; 055-600-792-655-544; 057-392-284-297-081; 057-854-907-659-266; 058-063-037-266-113; 059-790-090-462-903; 064-222-946-416-791; 064-327-070-430-812; 070-387-752-002-083; 071-128-125-229-764; 074-584-077-233-459; 076-720-080-903-106; 087-991-691-200-809; 095-874-358-491-937; 096-558-601-945-495; 097-222-159-458-236; 098-277-516-859-498; 102-115-650-201-495; 102-668-674-697-675; 110-934-761-269-686; 112-507-928-838-921; 113-184-123-590-319; 120-424-874-837-080; 123-248-307-932-339; 124-850-148-955-311; 127-473-686-648-632; 141-562-203-874-638; 144-551-450-594-92X; 157-836-209-064-35X; 166-809-427-581-497; 173-845-612-535-179; 175-755-079-554-999; 183-914-972-982-465,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

In these situations, the gap in performance between any two items can be significant, and the smallest and largest winning probabilities can be very close to zero or one. Furthermore, each item may be compared only to a subset of all the items, so that not all pairwise comparisons are observed. In this paper, we study the performance of the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for ranking from pairwise comparison data under more realistic settings than those considered in the literature so far. In particular, we allow for near-degenerate winning probabilities and arbitrary comparison designs. We obtain novel results about the existence of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the corresponding $\ell_2$ estimation error without the bounded winning probability assumption commonly used in the literature and for arbitrary comparison graph topologies. Central to our approach is the reliance on the Fisher information matrix to express the dependence on the graph topologies and the impact of the values of the winning probabilities on the estimation risk and on the conditions for the existence of the MLE. Our bounds recover existing results as special cases but are more broadly applicable.",,,,,Consistency (statistics); Discrete mathematics; Graph (abstract data type); Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Network topology; Zero (linguistics); Fisher information; Mathematics; Bounded function,,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11487.pdf https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11487.pdf,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.11487.pdf,,,3210246763,,0,003-884-026-543-130; 011-105-391-999-886; 021-304-036-982-259; 022-501-390-008-829; 022-628-699-660-469; 031-830-169-787-740; 045-187-870-348-998; 073-591-412-378-911; 079-367-665-908-927; 092-474-419-202-077; 094-630-349-889-33X; 130-092-514-560-131; 137-940-671-974-155; 146-071-057-852-048; 155-729-366-689-349; 173-739-209-507-152; 188-851-886-159-33X,0,true,,unknown

In a previous study measuring RT in children and adults asked to compare two successive stimuli (quantities or words), we discovered that the group RT distribution was bimodal, with some subjects responding with a mean RT of around 1100 ms and others with a mean RT of around 500 ms. This bimodal distribution suggested two distinct response strategies, one reactive, the other anticipatory. In the present study, we tested whether subjects' segregation into fast and slow responders (1) extended to other sequential comparative judgments (2) evolved from age 8 to adulthood, (3) could be linked to anticipation as assessed using computer modeling (4) stemmed from individual-specific strategies amenable to instruction. To test the first three predictions, we conducted a distributional and theoretical analysis of the RT of 158 subjects tested earlier using four different sequential comparative judgment tasks (numerosity, phonological, multiplication, subtraction). Group RT distributions were bimodal in all tasks, with the two strategies differing in speed and sometimes accuracy too. The fast strategy, which was rare or absent in 8- to 9-year-olds, steadily increased through childhood. Its frequency in adolescence remained, however, lower than in adulthood. A mixture model confirmed this developmental evolution, while a diffusion model corroborated the idea that the difference between the two strategies concerns anticipatory processes preceding decision processes. To test the fourth prediction, we conducted an online experiment where 236 participants made numerosity comparisons before and after an instruction favoring either reactive or anticipatory responses. The results provide out-of-the-lab evidence of the bimodal RT distribution associated with sequential comparisons and demonstrated that the proportions of fast vs. slow responders can be modulated simply by asking subjects to anticipate or not the future result of the comparison. Although anticipation of the future is as important for cognition as memory of the past, its evolution after the first year of life is much more poorly known. The present study is a step toward meeting this challenge. It also illustrates how analyzing individual RT distributions in addition to group RT distributions and using computational models can improve the assessment of decision making cognitive processes.",13,8,646,646,Numerosity adaptation effect; Psychology; Anticipation (artificial intelligence); Cognitive psychology; Cognition; Task (project management); Developmental psychology; Audiology; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Neuroscience; Medicine; Management; Economics,RT distribution; development; diffusion model; mixture model; sequential stimuli; strategies,,,Agence Nationale de la Recherche,https://www.mdpi.com/2076-328X/13/8/646/pdf?version=1691056061 https://doi.org/10.3390/bs13080646 https://hal.science/hal-04236410/document https://hal.science/hal-04236410,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/bs13080646,37622787,10.3390/bs13080646,,PMC10451546,0,000-171-748-772-550; 001-879-192-216-400; 003-886-116-661-498; 008-880-142-131-890; 012-084-643-892-070; 012-102-173-675-907; 013-904-426-084-429; 018-169-137-471-610; 022-684-204-361-544; 031-722-541-423-460; 032-198-326-050-882; 032-817-350-938-195; 033-815-881-974-897; 034-509-650-020-608; 036-023-141-528-975; 036-072-419-954-401; 038-350-852-262-211; 039-081-300-810-295; 039-096-729-162-675; 042-208-957-507-42X; 042-246-391-929-582; 042-284-805-028-643; 048-669-573-216-789; 049-781-303-227-265; 051-672-948-843-283; 052-546-471-387-67X; 058-555-996-286-372; 065-388-786-035-047; 068-153-118-849-320; 073-385-249-585-699; 078-574-358-648-630; 089-333-624-113-674; 093-560-556-275-528; 096-413-111-345-019; 098-270-604-649-093; 101-703-265-849-53X; 102-705-791-019-347; 103-224-217-295-282; 107-374-893-137-81X; 108-399-589-666-917; 114-229-603-236-725; 116-740-648-811-587; 124-670-429-927-44X; 132-875-457-443-599; 134-692-630-491-027; 140-071-244-823-383; 140-558-828-978-527; 145-979-870-366-425; 148-559-368-701-37X; 154-017-898-674-656,0,true,cc-by,gold

The superior players or objects in the ranking list are oftentimes estimated from matchups and pairwise comparisons. In order to predict the result of unobserved events, various models have been developed to integrate the matchup and pairwise comparison results into a single ranking list of players. Amongst these models, the Bradley-Terry model is the mainstream which achieves the goal by authorizing enriched probabilistic interpretation of players. However, the model suffers from its strong assumption of transitive relationships and becomes vulnerable in practice when intransitive relationships exist. In this paper, we propose a low-rank matrix approach to characterize all players and unify the related works on representation learning of players by rearranging the constructively.

In contrast, the literature on result-based talent identification in road cycling is remarkably scarce. The purpose of this paper is to provide insight into the possibilities of the use of publicly available data to discover new talented Under-23 (U23) riders via statistical learning methods (linear regression and random forest techniques). At the same time, we try to find out the main determinants of success for U23 riders in their first years of professional cycling. We collect results for more than 25000 road cycling races from 2007–2018 and consider more than 2500 riders from over 80 countries. We use the data from 2007 to 2017 to train and validate our models, and use the data from 2018 to predict how well U23 riders will perform in their first three elite years. Our results reveal that past U23 race results appear to be important predictors of future cycling performance.",325,1,1,18,Random forest; Data science; Athletes; Statistical learning; Road cycling; Computer science; Cycling; Contrast (statistics); Identification (information),Performance; Professional road cycling; Scouting; Talent identification,,,Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10479-021-04280-0 https://paperity.org/p/273544384/result-based-talent-identification-in-road-cycling-discovering-the-next-eddy-merckx https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8723430 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-021-04280-0.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-021-04280-0,34629606,10.1007/s10479-021-04280-0,3204669124,PMC8490850,0,000-642-972-202-200; 002-469-725-030-604; 006-306-297-176-541; 008-343-024-178-862; 016-128-620-448-177; 016-190-973-992-650; 017-050-065-791-169; 018-216-759-004-231; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-848-725-174-707; 031-995-835-346-919; 036-319-757-269-054; 038-054-760-889-002; 038-728-894-380-955; 040-802-208-400-827; 045-864-758-036-623; 049-537-855-323-269; 051-807-266-987-701; 052-487-838-410-77X; 056-802-749-906-08X; 056-875-401-728-726; 069-817-500-215-025; 070-103-857-773-151; 080-725-466-147-291; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-067-227-009-372; 098-793-204-963-414; 104-238-051-301-446; 128-169-993-556-076; 131-132-387-917-862; 135-182-532-397-391; 137-500-292-264-429; 138-152-216-399-346; 141-504-260-190-27X; 153-460-868-610-870; 155-323-303-898-151; 176-081-699-575-633; 176-486-453-814-767,5,true,,green

Despite being putatively grounded in the statistical regularities of the environment, scene priors are frequently violated due to the inherent variability of visual features from one scene to the next. However, these repeated violations do not appreciably challenge visuo-cognitive function, necessitating the broad use of priors in conjunction with context-specific information. We investigated the trade-off between participants' internal expectations formed from both longer-term priors and those formed from immediate contextual information using a perceptual inference task and naturalistic stimuli. Notably, our task required participants to make perceptual inferences about naturalistic images using their own internal criteria, rather than making comparative judgements. Nonetheless, we show that observers' performance is well approximated by a model that makes inferences using a prior for low-level image statistics, aggregated over many images. We further show that the dependence on this prior is rapidly re-weighted against contextual information, even when misleading. Our results therefore provide insight into how apparent high-level interpretations of scene appearances follow from the most basic of perceptual processes, which are grounded in the statistics of natural images.",242,,105631,105631,Prior probability; Perception; Psychology; Scene statistics; Context (archaeology); Inference; Cognitive psychology; Task (project management); Natural (archaeology); Cognition; Visual perception; Orientation (vector space); Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Bayesian probability; Mathematics; Paleontology; History; Management; Archaeology; Neuroscience; Economics; Biology; Geometry,Computational modelling; Image statistics; Naturalistic images; Visual perception,Humans; Judgment; Visual Perception; Cognition,,Australian Research Council; National Health and Medical Research Council,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105631,37820487,10.1016/j.cognition.2023.105631,,,0,001-256-712-003-732; 001-529-878-461-937; 002-064-085-911-060; 002-491-712-291-734; 002-608-830-214-912; 003-108-574-155-84X; 004-412-257-999-97X; 004-495-694-854-142; 005-589-187-502-728; 005-683-281-007-732; 007-937-750-616-021; 009-163-025-047-715; 009-332-873-714-984; 010-629-061-233-301; 013-064-393-085-978; 015-585-177-771-742; 015-730-462-360-529; 017-135-162-827-904; 019-636-410-789-758; 020-291-224-733-026; 023-847-808-127-02X; 024-306-285-412-917; 025-503-036-092-835; 026-837-694-510-345; 027-149-374-389-854; 027-469-339-304-213; 029-130-815-604-55X; 029-508-198-248-765; 030-660-282-108-118; 031-324-485-402-628; 035-682-216-930-014; 036-014-318-796-840; 036-215-458-962-338; 037-283-744-087-993; 038-418-507-357-648; 038-485-663-132-491; 038-597-067-017-08X; 038-996-393-744-547; 042-518-599-065-062; 043-313-402-247-864; 043-933-993-456-373; 044-172-477-182-751; 044-775-893-870-345; 045-582-156-978-714; 046-172-712-057-196; 048-498-071-032-230; 051-169-072-541-986; 054-930-354-927-496; 059-098-493-584-496; 059-951-315-889-604; 060-248-650-100-798; 061-971-783-481-511; 065-054-386-756-11X; 067-872-041-138-065; 069-744-192-005-522; 070-025-622-372-387; 070-055-960-937-368; 070-727-233-075-350; 071-162-359-326-400; 071-467-823-911-177; 071-520-103-682-994; 074-457-956-098-837; 075-514-429-812-247; 079-382-865-970-384; 080-266-920-202-204; 081-641-519-823-299; 082-317-326-613-457; 084-226-735-369-60X; 086-446-741-045-019; 086-754-320-670-558; 088-467-480-843-05X; 098-548-641-710-846; 118-400-350-348-632; 139-310-234-201-839; 162-378-343-549-214; 167-103-862-247-057,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Design is a key element of engineering education given the emphasis on its development through the ABET criteria. As such, design projects play a central role in many first-year engineering courses. Creativity is a vital component of design capability which can influence design performance; however, it is difficult to measure using traditional assessment rubrics and holistic assessment approaches may be more suitable to assess these solutions. One such holistic assessment approach is Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ). In this system, student designs are presented to judges in pairs, and they are asked to select the design that they deem to have demonstrated the greatest level of specified criteria. Each judge is asked to make multiple judgements where the work they are presented with is adaptively paired in order to create a ranked order of all solutions in the sample. The use of this approach in technology education has demonstrated high levels of reliability among judges (~0.9) irrespective of whether the judges are students or faculty. This research aimed to investigate the use of ACJ to holistically assess the creativity of design solutions in engineering education. The research also sought to explore the differences, if any, that would exist between the rank order produced by first-year engineering students and faculty who regularly teach first-year students. Forty-six first-year engineering students and 23 faculty participated in this research. A separate ACJ session was carried out with each of these groups; however, both groups were asked to assess the same items of work. Participants were instructed to assess the creativity of 101 solutions to a design task, a “Ping Pong problem,” where undergraduate engineering students had been asked to design a ping pong ball launcher. In both ACJ sessions each item of work (solution) was included in at least 11 pairwise comparisons, with the maximum number of comparisons for a single item being 29 in the faculty ACJ session and 50 in the student session. The data from the ACJ sessions were analyzed to determine the reliability of using ACJ to assess creativity of design solutions in first-year engineering education, and to explore whether the rankings produced from the first-year engineering students ACJ session differed significantly from those of the faculty. The results indicate a reasonably high level of reliability in both sessions as measured by the Scale Separation Reliability (SSR) coefficient, SSRfaculty = 0.65 ± 0.02, SSRstudents = 0.71 ± 0.02. Further a strong correlation was observed between the ACJ ranks produced by the students and faculty both when considered in terms of the relative differences between items of work, r = .533, p &lt; .001, and their absolute rank position, σ = .553, p &lt; .001. These findings indicate that ACJ is a promising tool for holistically assessing design solutions in engineering education. Additionally, given the strong correlation between ranks, ACJ could be used to include students in their own assessment to reduce the faculty grading burden or to develop a shared construct of capability to increase the alignment of teaching and learning.",,,,,Creativity; Mathematics education; Computer science; Psychology; Social psychology,,,,,https://peer.asee.org/44564.pdf https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--44564,http://dx.doi.org/10.18260/1-2--44564,,10.18260/1-2--44564,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Rector; Christina M. Plikaitis; Herluf Lund; Alexander Y. Lin,"BACKGROUND Despite existing anthropometric data in the literature regarding the variation of female external genital anatomy, the ideal aesthetic characteristics have yet to be defined. OBJECTIVES Authors used crowdsourcing in order to better evaluate preferred anatomic characteristics of external female genitalia. METHODS Fifty-six total images were digitally created by altering the proportions of the labia minora, labia majora, and clitoral hood. Images with differing ratios were presented in pairs to Amazon Mechanical Turk (Seattle, WA, USA) raters. Three different experiments were performed with each varying two of the three image characteristics to permit two factor modeling. The Bradley-Terry-Luce model was applied to the pairwise comparisons ratings to create a rank order for each image. Preferences for each anatomic variable were compared using chi-squared tests. RESULTS A total of 5000 raters participated. Experiment 1 compared differing widths of the labia majora and labia minora and determined a significant preference for larger labia majora width and mid-range labia minora width (p=0.007). Experiment 2 compared labia minora width versus clitoral hood length and showed a statistically significant preference for wider majoras (p<.001), but no significant preference in clitoral hood length (p=0.54). Experiment 3 compared clitoral hood length versus labia minora width and showed a statistically significant preference for mid-range labia minora widths (p<.001) but no significant preference in clitoral hood length (p=0.78).

However, it has been somewhat under-explored conceptually. Drawing on examples from assessment contexts including vocational performance, comparative judgement and the use of holistic judgement in teacher assessment for high stakes grading, we explicate a three-part definition of what holistic judgement constitutes. Holistic judgements result in singular outputs, derive from a comprehensive consideration of relevant constructs and acknowledge that the elements considered within them interconnect. However, holistic judgements may be made using considerably different processes by different judges without contravening this definition, and the ways in which different elements are weighted may vary. We then explore some factors, specific to assessment contexts, that might make holistic judgements more challenging, including materials being very different from one another, non-uniform candidate performance across materials and the presence of construct-irrelevant material. We set this assessment-specific discussion in the context of literatures on decision-making in psychology, medicine and other contexts. We conclude with some recommendations for when holistic judgement should and should not be used, and how holistic judgements can be made less cognitively challenging through the use of appropriate guidance and feedback to judges.",,,1,23,Judgement; Construct (python library); Psychology; Set (abstract data type); Context (archaeology); Grading (engineering); Epistemology; Social psychology; Management science; Computer science; Engineering; Paleontology; Philosophy; Civil engineering; Biology; Programming language,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/02671522.2023.2269960?needAccess=true https://doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2023.2269960,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2023.2269960,,10.1080/02671522.2023.2269960,,,0,000-858-303-812-143; 007-308-390-587-607; 007-509-924-722-270; 007-604-341-969-541; 009-223-414-710-201; 009-345-612-308-702; 015-624-023-169-969; 015-872-566-690-26X; 016-000-560-997-939; 016-992-645-746-754; 019-027-127-535-521; 019-045-602-908-091; 021-603-472-571-480; 022-668-652-690-747; 022-886-709-886-069; 025-448-910-847-271; 030-515-144-789-364; 031-362-028-763-687; 042-211-728-741-420; 043-897-792-062-241; 047-593-198-756-593; 051-426-516-197-907; 052-077-767-142-699; 054-237-940-428-90X; 057-268-436-366-341; 059-188-701-225-287; 062-104-655-845-115; 063-733-541-262-438; 068-816-143-977-759; 069-805-548-330-93X; 070-076-986-674-984; 074-692-351-660-006; 083-162-216-800-879; 093-987-142-588-535; 105-060-972-080-52X; 111-600-415-954-265; 116-509-809-746-412; 125-232-035-737-092; 129-834-900-211-92X; 143-181-553-263-320; 165-389-321-547-720; 170-760-456-367-609; 195-749-389-518-429,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

In the human neuroimaging literature, two signatures of bi-dimensional cognitive maps have been reported: the grid-like code and the distance-dependent code. While these kinds of representation were previously observed during spatial navigation and, more recently, during processing of perceptual stimuli, it is still an open question whether they also underlie the representation of the most basic items of language: words. Here we taught human participants the meaning of novel words as arbitrary labels for a set of audiovisual objects varying orthogonally in size and sound. The novel words were therefore conceivable as points in a navigable 2D map of meaning. While subjects performed a word comparison task, we recorded their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By applying a combination of representational similarity and fMRI-adaptation analyses, we found evidence of (i) a grid-like code, in the right postero-medial entorhinal cortex, representing the relative angular positions of words in the word space, and (ii) a distance-dependent code, in medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and mid-cingulate cortices, representing the Euclidean distance between words. Additionally, we found evidence that the brain also separately represents the single dimensions of word meaning: their implied size, encoded in visual areas, and their implied sound, in Heschl's gyrus/Insula. These results support the idea that the meaning of words, when they are organized along two dimensions, is represented in the human brain across multiple maps of different dimensionality. SIGNIFICANT STATEMENT: How do we represent the meaning of words and perform comparative judgements on them in our brain? According to influential theories, concepts are conceivable as points of an internal map (where distance represents similarity) that, as the physical space, can be mentally navigated. Here we use fMRI to show that when humans compare newly learnt words, they recruit a grid-like and a distance code, the same types of neural codes that, in mammals, represent relations between locations in the environment and support physical navigation between them.",232,,117876,,Artificial intelligence; Set (psychology); Code (cryptography); Cognitive map; Natural language processing; Perception; Human brain; Similarity (psychology); Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Gyrus; Entorhinal cortex; Meaning (existential); Computer science; Spatial memory,Distance code; Entorhinal cortex; Grid-like code; Navigation; Words; vmPFC,"Adult; Brain Mapping/methods; Cognition/physiology; Entorhinal Cortex/diagnostic imaging; Female; Humans; Language; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Photic Stimulation/methods; Recognition, Psychology/physiology; Semantics; Word Association Tests; Young Adult",,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811921001531 http://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33636346 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811921001531 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage232.html#ViganoRSBP21 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33636346/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,33636346,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,3130613096,,0,002-361-179-653-833; 003-028-967-630-066; 004-478-535-703-270; 006-613-053-767-871; 007-132-867-143-709; 011-538-156-264-314; 013-165-492-805-03X; 013-213-970-419-250; 014-210-555-069-030; 016-414-813-050-875; 024-189-717-981-292; 033-287-870-710-726; 033-442-984-511-466; 034-874-174-893-488; 036-735-214-067-934; 039-248-614-176-559; 041-222-456-792-220; 041-294-666-539-760; 042-966-784-480-742; 043-890-715-351-494; 044-264-243-301-461; 049-940-851-911-477; 054-630-926-268-365; 055-005-065-606-934; 056-105-599-056-361; 056-576-148-142-317; 063-433-869-352-088; 065-077-486-249-213; 067-879-125-389-808; 068-910-911-949-197; 070-297-699-153-640; 073-008-629-758-949; 074-606-876-553-859; 074-792-812-248-435; 076-529-940-900-699; 082-244-347-583-942; 082-541-909-852-077; 113-973-431-964-847; 116-599-876-467-271; 121-943-242-529-339; 132-577-677-705-698; 139-614-088-148-146; 154-068-214-565-994; 157-989-276-095-938; 170-359-567-943-583; 183-579-969-585-463,25,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Phillips; Mohammad T. Irfan; Luca Ostertag-Hill,"Game-theoretic models of influence in networks often assume the network structure to be static. In this paper, we allow the network structure to vary according to the underlying behavioral context. This leads to several interesting questions on two fronts. First, how do we identify different contexts and learn the corresponding network structures using real-world data? We focus on the U.S. Senate and apply unsupervised machine learning techniques, such as fuzzy clustering algorithms and generative models, to identify spheres of legislation as context and learn an influence network for each sphere. Second, how do we analyze these networks to gain an insight into the role played by the spheres of legislation in various interesting constructs like polarization and most influential nodes? To this end, we apply both game-theoretic and social network analysis techniques. In particular, we show that game-theoretic notion of most influential nodes brings out the strategic aspects of interactions like bipartisan grouping, which structural centrality measures fail to capture.",8,1,1,51,Fuzzy clustering; Focus (linguistics); Legislation; Context (language use); Social network analysis (criminology); Generative grammar; Computer science; Centrality; Unsupervised learning; Theoretical computer science,,,,Division of Information and Intelligent Systems,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-38378/v2.pdf?c=1605822417000 https://computationalsocialnetworks.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2 https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-38378/v2 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2/figures/40 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2.pdf https://doaj.org/article/e8d12d222295469a9637f4c46a2a824e,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2,,10.1186/s40649-021-00091-2,2989598297,,0,000-957-364-612-755; 001-170-065-793-186; 002-999-792-161-936; 004-109-344-578-047; 006-247-258-408-541; 007-107-460-065-943; 007-316-623-506-709; 010-153-208-612-656; 011-157-290-464-385; 011-325-224-839-126; 011-550-010-845-441; 015-082-755-618-965; 015-150-379-939-328; 015-573-492-337-323; 017-862-399-472-647; 019-706-336-089-489; 028-171-956-415-28X; 028-850-248-202-616; 031-398-119-387-837; 032-290-144-240-994; 033-359-592-709-759; 034-977-505-448-293; 037-029-897-660-670; 038-576-001-630-807; 040-042-047-720-74X; 044-711-704-966-768; 049-641-089-926-545; 050-320-077-462-032; 050-791-226-191-821; 050-910-087-348-524; 055-700-100-815-972; 058-188-411-998-891; 060-439-464-780-920; 061-069-718-729-65X; 064-352-063-943-323; 069-405-622-489-787; 075-353-003-318-95X; 077-186-658-494-767; 078-340-132-866-756; 079-283-256-886-511; 088-447-368-618-102; 092-803-682-539-413; 093-765-128-627-40X; 103-294-173-201-419; 110-010-093-522-198; 110-309-926-544-567; 118-131-130-022-902; 133-819-452-388-308; 138-042-458-474-110; 140-679-312-461-034; 141-836-816-221-58X; 159-094-131-192-214; 162-510-456-164-420; 168-788-495-210-658; 173-613-043-044-245; 174-368-575-525-04X; 176-749-472-857-879; 178-239-463-161-020; 179-600-401-824-838; 182-816-375-746-557; 188-332-136-393-173,1,true,cc-by,gold

A potential tool to morally sanction an artificial agent as admissible for its tasks is to apply a so-called moral Turing test (MTT) to the machine. The MTT can be supported by a pragmatist metaethics as an iteratively applied and modified procedure. However, this iterative, experimentalist procedure faces a dilemma due to the problem of technological entrenchment. I argue that, at least in certain important domains of application, the justification of artificial moral agents requires their deployment, which may entrench them and thereby undermine the justificatory process by hindering its further iteration.</jats:p>",1,1,,,Dilemma; Pragmatism; Turing; Process (computing); Moral dilemma; Iterative and incremental development; Computer science; Turing test; Artificial intelligence; Software deployment; Epistemology; Sociology; Philosophy; Psychology; Social psychology; Software engineering; Programming language; Operating system,,,,Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s44206-022-00003-5.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s44206-022-00003-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s44206-022-00003-5,,10.1007/s44206-022-00003-5,,,0,000-711-422-372-922; 011-074-725-304-433; 018-018-062-678-888; 035-153-761-619-076; 046-689-025-951-50X; 048-226-144-820-408; 049-964-335-153-83X; 051-374-065-333-591; 055-808-657-671-122; 069-642-918-904-993; 072-900-763-568-602; 074-920-663-139-772; 079-056-458-608-966; 109-869-878-550-427; 119-699-415-124-839; 121-084-787-181-51X; 143-645-763-678-199; 148-246-906-701-16X; 161-797-542-754-157,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

The key problem is to compute ranking scores, which are of interest for quantifying the strength of skills, relevancies, or preferences, and prediction of ranking outcomes. One of the most popular statistical models of ranking outcomes is the Bradley–Terry model for paired comparisons and its extensions to choice and full ranking outcomes. In “Accelerated MM Algorithms for Inference of Ranking Scores from Comparison Data,” M. Vojnovic, S.-Y. Yun, and K. Zhou show that a popular MM algorithm for inference of ranking scores for generalized Bradley–Terry ranking models suffers a slow convergence issue, and they propose a new accelerated algorithm that resolves this shortcoming and can yield substantial convergence speedups. </jats:p>",71,4,1318,1342,Ranking (information retrieval); Ranking SVM; Computer science; Machine learning; Inference; Learning to rank; Convergence (economics); Artificial intelligence; Algorithm; Data mining; Economics; Economic growth,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1287/opre.2022.2264,,10.1287/opre.2022.2264,,,0,002-565-096-488-611; 005-932-334-805-223; 009-086-498-665-795; 017-084-836-808-439; 027-051-629-024-617; 029-712-119-607-36X; 031-830-169-787-740; 033-178-194-761-663; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-056-088-441-570; 045-636-020-326-312; 045-897-463-088-371; 047-307-839-107-965; 063-387-182-081-678; 070-683-517-618-618; 072-963-058-714-430; 075-077-499-591-539; 079-367-665-908-927; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 113-951-938-866-51X; 120-424-874-837-080; 123-839-077-175-321; 124-626-119-412-629; 144-569-529-285-906; 144-607-646-779-766; 183-914-972-982-465,0,false,,

Tony Cai; Yichen Wang; Linjun Zhang,"Achieving optimal statistical performance while ensuring the privacy of personal data is a challenging yet crucial objective in modern data analysis. However, characterizing the optimality, particularly the minimax lower bound, under privacy constraints is technically difficult. To address this issue, we propose a novel approach called the score attack, which provides a lower bound on the differential-privacy-constrained minimax risk of parameter estimation. The score attack method is based on the tracing attack concept in differential privacy and can be applied to any statistical model with a well-defined score statistic. It can optimally lower bound the minimax risk of estimating unknown model parameters, up to a logarithmic factor, while ensuring differential privacy for a range of statistical problems. We demonstrate the effectiveness and optimality of this general method in various examples, such as the generalized linear model in both classical and high-dimensional sparse settings, the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for pairwise comparisons, and nonparametric regression over the Sobolev class.",,,,,Minimax; Differential privacy; Pairwise comparison; Upper and lower bounds; Computer science; Nonparametric statistics; Statistic; Mathematics; Mathematical optimization; Algorithm; Artificial intelligence; Statistics; Mathematical analysis,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.07152,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2303.07152,,10.48550/arxiv.2303.07152,,,0,,0,true,,green

Despite extensive studies, few prior literatures investigate this problem under the more realistic setting where covariate information exists. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel model, Covariate-Assisted Ranking Estimation (CARE) model, that extends the well-known Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, by incorporating the covariate information. Specifically, instead of assuming every compared item has a fixed latent score $\{\theta_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$, we assume the underlying scores are given by $\{\alpha_i^*+{x}_i^\top\beta^*\}_{i=1}^n$, where $\alpha_i^*$ and ${x}_i^\top\beta^*$ represent latent baseline and covariate score of the $i$-th item, respectively. We impose natural identifiability conditions and derive the $\ell_{\infty}$- and $\ell_2$-optimal rates for the maximum likelihood estimator of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^{n}$ and $\beta^*$ under a sparse comparison graph, using a novel `leave-one-out' technique (Chen et al., 2019) . To conduct statistical inferences, we further derive asymptotic distributions for the MLE of $\{\alpha_i^*\}_{i=1}^n$ and $\beta^*$ with minimal sample complexity. This allows us to answer the question whether some covariates have any explanation power for latent scores and to threshold some sparse parameters to improve the ranking performance. We improve the approximation method used in (Gao et al., 2021) for the BLT model and generalize it to the CARE model. Moreover, we validate our theoretical results through large-scale numerical studies and an application to the mutual fund stock holding dataset.",,,,,Covariate; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Ranking (information retrieval); Statistics; Identifiability; Inference; Mathematics; Econometrics; Latent variable; Computer science; Artificial intelligence,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2212.09961,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2212.09961,,10.48550/arxiv.2212.09961,,,0,,0,true,,green

Increasing our understanding of 18F-FDG distribution in oncology by direct coregistration of histopathology and autoradiography in malignancies of the head and neck,2021-09-24,2021,journal article,European journal of nuclear medicine and molecular imaging,16197089; 16197070,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Germany,Jens Debacker; David Creytens; Yves D'Asseler; Kathia De Man; Benedicte Descamps; Vincent Keereman; Sasha Libbrecht; Vanessa Schelfhout; Koen Van de Vijver; Christian Vanhove; Wouter Huvenne,"Aim/Introduction: Over the last decades, the use of 18F-FDG has taken a pivotal role in oncological diagnosis, staging and follow-up. While endless research has shown the clinical importance of 18F-FDG, we remain unaware how 18F-FDG behaves in and around human malignancies on a submillimetric scale. Unfortunately, as glucose metabolism is an active process, pathological assessment of relevant protein markers was found to be inadequate in correctly predicting 18F-FDG-uptake. Technological improvements are resulting in increasing spatial resolution for PET-scanners, therefore an urgent understanding of 18F-FDG-distribution on these higher resolutions is required. Materials and Methods: In the current study, we developed a methodology that enabled direct coregistration of the radioactivity-distribution in a surgically resected specimen with histopathological assessment. Patients were injected with 4 MBq/kg of 18F-FDG prior to the initiation of standard of care surgical oncological resection. After resection of the malignancy, the surgical specimen was imaged using preclinical micro-PET and -CT devices with a spatial resolution of 800µm and 50µm, respectively. After imaging, the specimen was freshly sliced into thin slices of approximately 2mm by a pathologist. One slice was snap-frozen and frozen sections were imaged using an autoradiographic flm overnight. Following the imaging, frozen sections were stained with standard hematoxylin and eosin staining. Pathological results were overlayed with the results of 18F-FDG PET/CT and autoradiography to coregister the histopathological and imaging results. Results: We performed this methodology on a total of four patients with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (n=2), angiosarcoma (n=1) and thyroid medullary carcinoma (n=1). While the mean time between injection and autoradiography was 3h49, we were able to image sufcient radioactivity to directly coregister the results with the clinical pathological frozen sections. All regions with identifed malignant tissue displayed increased 18F-FDG-uptake. However, uptake was not limited to these regions, as a similar increased uptake was identifed in adjacent benign sebaceous glands. Interestingly, we also identifed a heterogeneous 18F-FDGuptake in separate clusters of malignant tissue, which could partly be explained by the cluster’s amount of peritumoral infammatory cells. Conclusion: To the best of our knowledge, these results are the frst to describe direct coregistration of 18F-FDG with the gold standard of histopathology in any human malignancy.

Best,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>We provide a detailed history of the concepts of atomic number and isotopy before the discovery of protons and neutrons that draws attention to the role of evolving interplays of multiple aims and criteria in chemical and physical research. Focusing on research by Frederick Soddy and Ernest Rutherford, we show that, in the context of differentiating disciplinary projects, the adoption of a complex and shifting concept of elemental identity and the ordering role of the periodic table led to a relatively coherent notion of atomic number. Subsequent attention to valency, still neglected in the secondary literature, and to nuclear charge led to a decoupling of the concepts of elemental identity and weight and allowed for a coherent concept of isotopy. This concept received motivation from empirical investigations on the decomposition series of radioelements and their unstable chemical identity. A new model of chemical order was the result of an ongoing collaboration between chemical and physical research projects with evolving aims and standards. After key concepts were considered resolved and their territories were clarified, chemistry and physics resumed autonomous projects, yet remained bound by newly accepted explanatory relations. It is an episode of scientific collaboration and partial integration without simple, wholesale gestalt switches or chemical revolutions.</jats:p>",25,1,67,99,Epistemology; Context (archaeology); Identity (music); Chemistry; Physics; Paleontology; Philosophy; Biology; Acoustics,,,,Western Sydney University,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10698-022-09450-x.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10698-022-09450-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10698-022-09450-x,,10.1007/s10698-022-09450-x,,,0,002-434-774-423-746; 002-818-452-789-924; 003-458-959-853-307; 007-602-935-106-349; 008-252-593-612-389; 009-182-665-167-890; 010-362-102-359-059; 014-260-684-141-276; 015-854-672-754-66X; 021-132-672-963-261; 022-093-054-503-599; 022-932-723-983-767; 024-513-323-070-789; 035-672-302-385-295; 035-881-084-019-350; 037-504-297-641-986; 040-838-783-832-858; 041-006-145-247-616; 041-236-995-868-412; 043-801-912-681-233; 047-744-826-439-763; 050-782-223-773-338; 051-057-378-050-139; 051-424-598-068-308; 051-850-241-321-552; 053-742-642-099-23X; 057-019-529-193-307; 058-028-040-107-531; 058-321-568-862-28X; 064-198-890-878-155; 067-459-636-649-543; 078-111-831-462-671; 079-409-157-197-244; 080-526-942-228-809; 083-703-659-337-835; 087-907-490-495-298; 090-038-905-328-579; 097-911-747-917-543; 101-638-764-207-613; 101-978-514-504-237; 101-982-108-378-476; 102-665-331-239-003; 106-150-395-902-559; 111-139-219-331-180; 111-441-608-140-019; 112-276-104-744-417; 112-923-871-671-990; 113-782-080-966-266; 114-748-882-731-634; 138-009-103-769-820; 139-553-703-349-454; 141-859-469-913-275; 151-121-320-395-133; 163-814-704-626-137; 180-639-802-141-054; 195-590-523-355-076,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

011-309-348-664-188,Dynamic Ranking with the BTL Model: A Nearest Neighbor based Rank Centrality Method,2021-09-28,2021,preprint,arXiv: Statistics Theory,,,,Eglantine Karlé; Hemant Tyagi,"Many applications such as recommendation systems or sports tournaments involve pairwise comparisons within a collection of $n$ items, the goal being to aggregate the binary outcomes of the comparisons in order to recover the latent strength and/or global ranking of the items. In recent years, this problem has received significant interest from a theoretical perspective with a number of methods being proposed, along with associated statistical guarantees under the assumption of a suitable generative model. ; While these results typically collect the pairwise comparisons as one comparison graph $G$, however in many applications - such as the outcomes of soccer matches during a tournament - the nature of pairwise outcomes can evolve with time. Theoretical results for such a dynamic setting are relatively limited compared to the aforementioned static setting. We study in this paper an extension of the classic BTL (Bradley-Terry-Luce) model for the static setting to our dynamic setup under the assumption that the probabilities of the pairwise outcomes evolve smoothly over the time domain $[0,1]$. Given a sequence of comparison graphs $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ on a regular grid $\mathcal{T} \subset [0,1]$, we aim at recovering the latent strengths of the items $w_t \in \mathbb{R}^n$ at any time $t \in [0,1]$. To this end, we adapt the Rank Centrality method - a popular spectral approach for ranking in the static case - by locally averaging the available data on a suitable neighborhood of $t$. When $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ is a sequence of Erdos-Renyi graphs, we provide non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ error bounds for estimating $w_t^*$ which in particular establishes the consistency of this method in terms of $n$, and the grid size $\lvert\mathcal{T}\rvert$. We also complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on real and synthetic data.",,,,,k-nearest neighbors algorithm; Combinatorics; Rank (graph theory); Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Order (ring theory); Mathematics; Sequence; Complement (set theory); Centrality,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210913743K/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13743 https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/2109.13743/ http://arxiv.org/pdf/2109.13743.pdf,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210913743K/abstract,,,3202599194,,0,009-185-754-618-167; 010-492-501-069-476; 022-501-390-008-829; 023-478-492-046-416; 027-048-508-707-668; 027-150-047-044-961; 029-320-744-162-009; 031-779-699-577-483; 032-045-684-580-114; 040-081-751-236-97X; 040-386-525-069-859; 047-307-839-107-965; 070-282-043-787-112; 072-843-415-820-973; 084-504-045-872-766; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-748-427-455-489; 092-474-419-202-077; 094-630-349-889-33X; 105-786-161-898-478; 106-996-107-356-637; 130-026-163-479-01X; 132-958-917-686-422; 188-851-886-159-33X; 195-685-864-553-865,0,true,,unknown

I introduce and evaluate a new neurally-inspired dual diffusion model, the linear drift, linear infinitesimal variance (LDLIV) model, which embodies three features often thought to characterize neural mechanisms of decision making. The accumulating evidence is intrinsically positively-valued, saturates at high intensities, and is accumulated for each alternative separately. I present explicit integral-equation predictions for the response time distribution and choice probabilities for the LDLIV model and compare its performance on two benchmark sets of data to three other models: the standard diffusion model and two dual diffusion model composed of racing Wiener processes, one between absorbing and reflecting boundaries and one with absorbing boundaries only. The LDLIV model and the standard diffusion model performed similarly to one another, although the standard diffusion model is more parsimonious, and both performed appreciably better than the other two dual diffusion models. I argue that accumulation of noisy evidence by a diffusion process and drift rate variability are both expressions of how the cognitive system solves von Neumann's problem, by aggregating noisy representations over time and over elements of a neural population. I also argue that models that do not solve von Neumann's problem do not address the main theoretical question that historically motivated research in this area.",30,4,1323,1359,Infinitesimal; Von Neumann architecture; Diffusion; Variance (accounting); Applied mathematics; Computation; Linear model; Noise (video); Representation (politics); Population; Linear regression; Statistical physics; Mathematics; Computer science; Econometrics; Artificial intelligence; Algorithm; Statistics; Mathematical analysis; Pure mathematics; Physics; Demography; Accounting; Sociology; Business; Image (mathematics); Thermodynamics; Politics; Political science; Law,Accumulator model; Decision making; Diffusion model; Sequential-sampling model,Humans; Decision Making/physiology; Reproducibility of Results; Reaction Time/physiology; Linear Models,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13423-022-02237-3.pdf https://doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02237-3 https://psyarxiv.com/2atqj/download https://psyarxiv.com/2atqj/ https://osf.io/2atqj/download https://osf.io/2atqj/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-022-02237-3,36720804,10.3758/s13423-022-02237-3,,PMC10482797,0,000-296-126-305-367; 000-650-928-555-981; 001-052-505-004-375; 001-262-433-601-394; 004-165-239-429-599; 005-310-450-981-017; 005-364-968-935-588; 005-687-342-390-236; 005-702-834-185-098; 006-329-999-924-032; 006-806-902-784-766; 007-023-953-914-108; 007-060-749-004-206; 007-512-146-614-819; 007-562-182-085-550; 008-898-813-267-293; 009-380-689-254-718; 010-998-556-324-970; 011-435-254-811-666; 012-821-526-450-393; 013-816-318-204-972; 015-099-619-114-093; 015-431-155-536-512; 015-905-510-419-735; 016-546-079-215-851; 017-034-403-178-325; 019-983-640-633-616; 021-550-382-043-282; 022-513-574-133-227; 023-505-039-877-183; 024-730-185-845-283; 025-162-502-739-710; 025-264-439-682-535; 025-351-669-284-44X; 026-060-567-569-504; 029-240-739-812-337; 030-102-158-614-682; 030-258-526-131-58X; 030-814-979-218-21X; 030-859-577-484-389; 031-508-342-624-086; 031-781-718-890-102; 032-905-474-283-59X; 033-025-909-880-678; 034-937-691-844-161; 035-011-568-321-792; 035-764-593-157-53X; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-372-499-707-201; 038-062-426-505-384; 038-572-244-399-816; 038-672-345-458-473; 039-383-609-479-063; 039-399-616-486-989; 039-655-406-711-973; 040-133-968-706-188; 041-333-714-992-228; 043-483-525-419-98X; 043-737-823-895-009; 044-161-468-943-922; 046-045-222-026-715; 046-935-468-608-736; 047-563-250-543-812; 048-266-771-549-406; 048-384-203-814-803; 049-239-335-673-18X; 049-967-413-547-644; 051-883-061-562-851; 051-984-450-390-195; 052-345-732-373-671; 054-475-653-276-353; 056-921-947-185-430; 057-969-051-328-995; 058-877-646-082-38X; 059-856-261-443-862; 061-214-352-934-509; 061-251-830-255-993; 062-552-728-049-347; 063-688-050-426-59X; 070-885-049-491-171; 071-483-634-619-521; 071-815-297-843-773; 072-141-753-526-797; 075-160-070-525-456; 077-655-580-594-096; 078-517-923-951-675; 080-226-560-982-457; 080-413-568-895-271; 080-684-743-755-327; 081-097-207-430-350; 083-257-209-932-402; 084-654-594-902-124; 085-851-860-472-454; 085-990-836-866-066; 086-440-116-937-399; 090-182-186-756-679; 090-319-191-365-730; 091-592-230-081-233; 093-861-925-204-733; 094-385-219-750-616; 098-476-655-958-949; 098-571-927-449-415; 098-606-519-055-190; 098-658-335-803-478; 099-399-791-704-994; 100-976-789-293-63X; 101-774-651-816-144; 102-645-414-486-562; 103-224-217-295-282; 103-987-260-443-602; 105-090-198-857-447; 109-462-021-710-239; 109-637-052-009-13X; 111-932-130-558-737; 114-405-088-439-201; 116-208-128-128-978; 119-772-432-647-98X; 120-671-036-287-102; 124-507-549-711-23X; 125-025-986-780-764; 126-241-653-886-096; 128-768-749-882-093; 129-705-579-740-41X; 132-875-457-443-599; 143-732-960-054-241; 145-181-805-072-153; 145-780-986-492-038; 148-559-368-701-37X; 151-917-551-126-962; 160-743-585-103-880; 161-583-748-004-876; 166-500-544-475-671; 179-518-391-278-593,3,true,cc-by,hybrid
011-640-151-457-556,Are Adults and Children One Another's Moral Equals?,2022-02-07,2022,journal article,The Journal of Ethics,13824554; 15728609,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Giacomo Floris,"The question of the basis of human equality has recently gained increasing attention. However, much of the literature has focused on whether persons—understood as fully competent adults—have equal moral status, while relatively less attention has been devoted to the analysis of what grounds the equal moral status of those human beings who are not fully competent adults. This paper contributes to this debate by addressing the question of the equality of moral status between adults and children. Specifically, this paper has three aims. First, it provides a conceptual map of this complex issue. Second, it argues that the challenges that have been raised against standard accounts of persons’ equal moral status are even more forceful when applied to the question of adults and children’s moral equality. Finally, it examines what a commitment to adults and children’s moral inequality entails and what it does not, thereby showing that the justificatory role of the principle of moral equality is not as far-reaching as commonly assumed.",27,1,31,50,Moral development; Moral disengagement; Social cognitive theory of morality; Sociology; Epistemology; Moral psychology; Inequality; Moral reasoning; Social psychology; Psychology; Philosophy; Mathematics; Mathematical analysis,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10892-021-09390-2.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10892-021-09390-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10892-021-09390-2,,10.1007/s10892-021-09390-2,,,0,003-416-051-261-138; 007-776-882-325-897; 008-575-519-043-751; 009-269-973-542-56X; 011-593-388-954-172; 011-975-854-683-247; 016-599-137-143-745; 021-348-266-821-869; 024-224-514-358-856; 027-637-410-130-376; 029-186-311-021-759; 030-616-606-040-730; 039-764-405-817-998; 045-718-568-332-637; 045-874-563-781-77X; 052-406-578-137-879; 060-629-543-906-541; 069-282-089-523-117; 072-342-471-518-001; 078-426-296-860-331; 079-142-412-614-069; 091-174-705-828-432; 115-864-547-345-394; 118-887-560-106-874; 144-017-284-313-853; 146-959-404-953-786; 154-963-971-281-287; 166-541-700-198-452; 184-729-125-105-738,2,true,,bronze

We consider an adversarial setting where the voters are partitioned into two sets. The first set votes in a stochastic manner according to the popular score-based Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons. The second set comprises malicious Byzantine voters trying to deteriorate the ranking. We consider a strongly-adversarial scenario where the Byzantine voters know the BTL scores, the votes of the good voters, the algorithm, and can collude with each other. We first show that the popular spectral ranking based Rank-Centrality algorithm, though optimal for the BTL model, does not perform well even when a small constant fraction of the voters are Byzantine. We introduce the Byzantine Spectral Ranking Algorithm (and a faster variant of it), which produces a reliable ranking when the number of good voters exceeds the number of Byzantine voters. We show that no algorithm can produce a satisfactory ranking with probability > 1/2 for all BTL weights when there are more Byzantine voters than good voters, showing that our algorithm works for all possible population fractions. We support our theoretical results with experimental results on synthetic and real datasets to demonstrate the failure of the Rank-Centrality algorithm under several adversarial scenarios and how the proposed Byzantine Spectral Ranking algorithm is robust in obtaining good rankings.",,,,,Ranking (information retrieval); Ranking SVM; Rank (graph theory); Centrality; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Pairwise comparison; Algorithm; Fraction (chemistry); Byzantine architecture; Artificial intelligence; Theoretical computer science; Mathematics; Combinatorics; Geography; Chemistry; Organic chemistry; Archaeology; Programming language,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.07902,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2211.07902,,10.48550/arxiv.2211.07902,,,0,,0,true,,green

Coates; Bilge Sayim,"The perception of a target depends on other stimuli surrounding it in time and space. This contextual modulation is ubiquitous in visual perception, and is usually quantified by measuring performance on sets of highly similar stimuli. Implicit or explicit comparisons among the stimuli may, however, inadvertently bias responses and conceal strong variability of target appearance. Here, we investigated the influence of contextual stimuli on the perception of a repeating pattern (a line triplet), presented in the visual periphery. In the neutral condition, the triplet was presented a single time to capture its minimally biased perception. In the similar and dissimilar conditions, it was presented within stimulus sets composed of lines similar to the triplet, and distinct shapes, respectively. The majority of observers reported perceiving a line pair in the neutral and dissimilar conditions, revealing 'redundancy masking', the reduction of the perceived number of repeating items. In the similar condition, by contrast, the number of lines was overestimated. Our results show that the similar context did not reveal redundancy masking which was only observed in the neutral and dissimilar context.

Despite recent progress on the first-order asymptotics of several popular procedures, the understanding of uncertainty quantification in the BTL model remains largely incomplete, especially when the underlying comparison graph is sparse. In this paper, we fill this gap by focusing on two estimators that have received much recent attention: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the spectral estimator. Using a unified proof strategy, we derive sharp and uniform non-asymptotic expansions for both estimators in the sparsest possible regime (up to some poly-logarithmic factors) of the underlying comparison graph. These expansions allow us to obtain: (i) finite-dimensional central limit theorems for both estimators; (ii) construction of confidence intervals for individual ranks; (iii) optimal constant of $\ell _2$ estimation, which is achieved by the MLE but not by the spectral estimator. Our proof is based on a self-consistent equation of the second-order remainder vector and a novel leave-two-out analysis.</jats:p>",12,2,1073,1140,Estimator; Remainder; Mathematics; Pairwise comparison; Logarithm; Applied mathematics; Limit (mathematics); Graph; Benchmark (surveying); Statistics; Combinatorics; Mathematical analysis; Arithmetic; Geodesy; Geography,,,,National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; National Science Foundation; Alfred H.

We are concerned here with likelihood ratio tests in the $\beta$-model for undirected graphs. For two growing dimensional null hypotheses including a specified null $H_0: \beta_i=\beta_i^0$ for $i=1,\ldots, r$ and a homogenous null $H_0: \beta_1=\cdots=\beta_r$, we reveal high dimensional Wilks' phenomena that the normalized log-likelihood ratio statistic, $[2\{\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) - \ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0)\} - r]/(2r)^{1/2}$, converges in distribution to the standard normal distribution as $r$ goes to infinity. Here, $\ell( \boldsymbol{\beta})$ is the log-likelihood function on the vector parameter $\boldsymbol{\beta}=(\beta_1, \ldots, \beta_n)^\top$, $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}$ is its maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the full parameter space, and $\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0$ is the restricted MLE under the null parameter space. For the corresponding fixed dimensional null $H_0: \beta_i=\beta_i^0$ for $i=1,\ldots, r$ and the homogenous null $H_0: \beta_1=\cdots=\beta_r$ with a fixed $r$, we establish Wilks type of results that $2\{\ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}) - \ell(\widehat{\boldsymbol{\beta}}^0)\}$ converges in distribution to a Chi-square distribution with respective $r$ and $r-1$ degrees of freedom, as the total number of parameters, $n$, goes to infinity. The Wilks type of results are further extended into a closely related Bradley--Terry model for paired comparisons, where we discover a different phenomenon that the log-likelihood ratio statistic under the fixed dimensional specified null asymptotically follows neither a Chi-square nor a rescaled Chi-square distribution.

Spektor; Karl Christoph Klauer,"In everyday life, recognition decisions often have to be made for multiple objects simultaneously. In contrast, research on recognition memory has predominantly relied on single-item recognition paradigms. We present a first systematic investigation into the cognitive processes that differ between single-word and paired-word tests of recognition memory. In a single-word test, participants categorize previously presented words and new words as having been studied before (old) or not (new). In a paired-word test, however, the test words are randomly paired, and participants provide joint old–new categorizations of both words for each pair. Across two experiments (N = 170), we found better memory performance for words tested singly rather than in pairs and, more importantly, dependencies between the two single-word decisions implied by the paired-word test. We extended two popular model classes of single-item recognition to paired-word recognition, a discrete-state model and a continuous model. Both models attribute performance differences between single-word and paired-word recognition to differences in memory-evidence strength. Discrete-state models account for the dependencies in paired-word decisions in terms of dependencies in guessing. In contrast, continuous models map the dependencies on mnemonic (Experiment 1 & 2) as well as on decisional processes (Experiment 2). However, in both experiments, model comparison favored the discrete-state model, indicating that memory decisions for word pairs seem to be mediated by discrete states. Our work suggests that individuals tackle multiple-item recognition fundamentally differently from single-item recognition, and it provides both a behavioral and model-based paradigm for studying multiple-item recognition.",49,4,787,802,Continuous modelling; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Cognitive model; Cognition; Mnemonic; Natural language processing; Contrast (statistics); Recognition memory; Word (group theory); Categorization,Cognitive modeling; Continuous models; Discrete-state models; Recognition memory,"Humans; Memory; Mental Recall; Recognition, Psychology",,,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8081710 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-020-01082-w https://paperity.org/p/261279773/the-simultaneous-recognition-of-multiple-words-a-process-analysis https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13421-020-01082-w.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33834382 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8081710,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13421-020-01082-w,33834382,10.3758/s13421-020-01082-w,3146276321,PMC8081710,0,001-592-260-026-599; 003-537-979-550-755; 004-888-456-094-990; 005-367-204-029-159; 005-586-336-124-561; 006-580-970-896-429; 013-750-587-536-618; 015-415-510-206-770; 018-714-338-296-493; 018-879-876-136-847; 019-102-912-761-02X; 023-045-199-147-919; 023-902-548-706-226; 025-307-117-670-619; 028-687-976-692-812; 030-388-499-549-301; 031-341-974-676-704; 034-039-085-623-663; 036-313-804-364-269; 036-736-916-447-100; 040-087-122-101-201; 048-549-215-206-285; 049-403-721-730-13X; 049-408-229-973-829; 050-788-494-852-203; 051-905-742-573-622; 060-356-629-409-190; 065-938-257-449-563; 067-428-930-337-768; 068-357-978-727-07X; 076-217-378-637-826; 078-666-787-277-143; 081-004-692-688-033; 081-596-143-336-096; 083-745-639-866-460; 102-455-065-649-484; 102-668-674-697-675; 110-133-585-290-485; 111-265-079-047-31X; 112-572-729-003-500; 113-286-538-807-265; 115-102-354-884-075; 122-739-211-268-189; 125-693-227-933-575; 125-809-872-765-131; 143-286-713-202-617; 198-794-736-638-209; 198-905-128-870-759,4,true,cc-by,hybrid

This appears to stem from ACJ being seen to offer a solution to the difficulties faced in the assessment of designerly activity which is prominent in contemporary technology education internationally. Central research questions to date have focused on whether ACJ was feasible, reliable, and offered broad educational merit. With exploratory evidence indicating this to be the case, there is now a need to progress this research agenda in a more systematic fashion. To support this, a critical review of how ACJ has been used and studied in prior work was conducted. The findings are presented thematically and suggest the existence of internal validity threats in prior research, the need for a theoretical framework and the consideration of falsifiability, and the need to justify and make transparent methodological and analytical procedures. Research questions now of pertinent importance are presented, and it is envisioned that the observations made through this review will support the design of future inquiry.</jats:p>",7,,,,Falsifiability; Engineering ethics; Exploratory research; Psychology; Work (physics); Management science; Epistemology; Sociology; Engineering; Social science; Philosophy; Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.787926/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.787926 https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/31729/1/feduc-07-787926.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.787926,,10.3389/feduc.2022.787926,,,0,003-090-934-868-77X; 003-133-894-756-155; 005-967-051-498-585; 007-840-977-956-003; 013-424-372-184-252; 018-191-594-451-288; 018-605-865-007-224; 024-043-673-348-847; 030-197-391-074-111; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-074-215-555-284; 051-426-516-197-907; 067-258-923-634-861; 072-849-297-804-522; 081-547-256-855-879; 083-897-352-316-114; 085-598-782-953-570; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-096-746-639-636; 123-212-204-814-685; 128-487-843-036-976; 149-208-961-050-864; 161-390-094-420-983; 168-704-895-296-891; 185-957-501-705-093,3,true,cc-by,gold

Some of the most widely studied judgments humans make from faces are evaluative judgments of facial attractiveness. These judgments are made frequently, automatically, and have important implications for judgments of other important social characteristics like trustworthiness and personality. A relatively understudied set of facial attractiveness judgments that are made from faces are comparative judgments, or social comparisons, of facial attractiveness. Based on social comparison theory, and what is known about evaluative judgments of facial attractiveness, it is likely that social comparisons of facial attractiveness are also frequent and have important implications. Despite this, little is known about social comparisons of facial attractiveness. To address this gap in the literature, three multi-method studies were conducted in this dissertation. The first was a systematic review to synthesize the existing research that directly or indirectly addressed social comparisons of facial attractiveness. Studies Two and Three empirically investigated whether or not social comparisons of facial attractiveness have features of automaticity. Study Two used a think aloud methodology to investigate the mandatory nature of social comparisons of facial attractiveness, whereas Study Three experimentally investigated how quickly social comparisons of facial attractiveness can be made. Together, these studies revealed more about how social comparisons of facial attractiveness occur and have theoretical implications for future research on the automaticity of mental processes more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Attractiveness; Face (sociological concept); Facial attractiveness; Psychology; Social psychology; Sociology; Social science; Psychoanalysis,,,,,https://rshare.library.torontomu.ca/articles/thesis/Face-to-Face_An_Investigation_of_Social_Comparisons_of_Facial_Attractiveness/25213664/1/files/44535149.pdf https://doi.org/10.32920/25213664,http://dx.doi.org/10.32920/25213664,,10.32920/25213664,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Dias; Michael Betancourt; Patricia María Rodríguez-González; Luís Borda-de-Água,"<jats:p>Ecological communities change because of both natural and human factors. Distinguishing between the two is critical to ecology and conservation science. One of the most common approaches for modelling species composition changes is calculating beta diversity indices and then relating index changes to environmental changes. The main difficulty with these analyses is that beta diversity indices are paired comparisons, which means indices calculated with the same community are not independent. Mantel tests and generalised dissimilarity modelling (GDM) are two of the most commonly used statistical procedures for analysing such data, employing randomisation tests to consider the data’s dependence. Here, we introduce a Bayesian model-based approach called BetaBayes that explicitly incorporates the data dependence. This approach is based on the Bradley–Terry model, which is a widely used approach for modelling paired comparisons that involves building a standard regression model containing two varying intercepts, one for each community involved in the beta diversity index, that capture their respective contributions. We used BetaBayes to analyse a famous dataset collected in Panama that contains information on multiple 1 ha plots from the rain forests of Panama. We calculated the Bray–Curtis index between all pairs of plots, analysed the relationship between the index and two covariates (geographic distance and elevation), and compared the results of BetaBayes with those from the Mantel test and GDM. BetaBayes has two distinctive features. The first is its flexibility, which allows the user to quickly change it to fit the data structure; namely, by adding varying effects, incorporating spatial autocorrelation, and modelling complex nonlinear relationships. The second is that it provides a clear path for performing model validation and model improvement. BetaBayes avoids hypothesis testing, instead focusing on recreating the data generating process and quantifying all the model configurations that are consistent with the observed data.</jats:p>",14,10,858,858,Mantel test; Beta diversity; Index (typography); Covariate; Spatial analysis; Bayesian probability; Ecology; Diversity index; Statistics; Regression; Random forest; Autocorrelation; Geography; Computer science; Econometrics; Mathematics; Biodiversity; Machine learning; Species richness; Genetic diversity; Biology; Population; Demography; Sociology; World Wide Web,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/1424-2818/14/10/858/pdf?version=1665661484 https://doi.org/10.3390/d14100858 https://www.repository.utl.pt/bitstream/10400.5/26012/1/CEABN-CIBIO-diversity-14-00858-v2.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/10400.5/26012,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/d14100858,,10.3390/d14100858,,,0,001-738-917-382-352; 012-042-665-277-671; 012-890-678-314-058; 014-077-342-742-500; 014-222-619-452-919; 018-269-445-638-29X; 023-613-048-371-06X; 027-150-047-044-961; 027-719-717-582-712; 028-080-008-579-010; 031-830-169-787-740; 033-959-081-640-939; 036-809-137-442-364; 039-602-767-986-164; 044-002-731-936-108; 048-024-663-664-413; 050-923-521-610-912; 057-226-726-733-714; 062-423-343-714-78X; 065-805-331-673-928; 076-703-740-040-947; 076-974-151-049-227; 079-863-114-555-507; 081-370-959-105-221; 082-069-729-132-228; 084-642-450-954-226; 084-963-686-695-168; 087-320-160-878-146; 088-707-875-136-173; 093-166-409-927-877; 097-439-417-163-148; 098-808-269-630-783; 108-413-022-888-904; 109-725-430-248-059; 124-171-041-782-890; 143-930-915-503-842; 162-845-581-577-800,2,true,cc-by,gold

Few approaches show innovative benefits beyond being logistical aids. Comparative judgment (CJ) has the potential to enhance educational practices by providing a mechanism for reliable assessment, supporting formative feedback, and by supporting critical discourse on evidence of learning. This chapter provides an overview of CJ as it has been used in educational assessment and describes how it can be facilitated by digitalization by providing illustrative examples of research studies, mainly undertaken for formative purposes. Specifically, this chapter provides an introduction to CJ and a description of its theoretical roots, presents possible approaches and agendas for the use of CJ ranging from being a pedagogical tool in a classroom to being a mediator for continuing professional development and discusses implications for practice and future research needs. Ultimately, it is envisaged that this chapter will act as a source of inspiration for educational stakeholders who wish to use CJ to add value to their practice.",,,289,307,Continuing professional development; Sociology; Educational assessment; Value (ethics); Research studies; Research needs; Formative assessment; Engineering ethics; Mechanism (biology),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-67349-9_20,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-67349-9_20,,10.1007/978-3-030-67349-9_20,3169494207,,0,003-133-894-756-155; 006-361-161-554-955; 008-515-844-318-494; 013-424-372-184-252; 016-279-152-792-986; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-486-381-437-418; 024-043-673-348-847; 027-024-910-044-405; 027-738-272-082-646; 031-515-155-921-902; 035-558-512-153-231; 035-776-610-863-582; 043-128-207-906-620; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-675-051-708-189; 051-426-516-197-907; 055-247-734-603-784; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-535-080-372-187; 068-582-222-430-445; 076-674-971-347-639; 099-922-806-687-837; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-175-236-000-695; 107-096-746-639-636; 123-212-204-814-685; 126-454-221-798-016; 126-875-389-752-711; 127-932-632-751-618; 130-763-790-078-450; 138-111-878-359-49X; 149-208-961-050-864; 152-943-168-760-368; 163-938-197-264-411; 168-704-895-296-891,1,false,,

However, data availability is not always given in complex real-world systems, and even available data may not fully reflect all the underlying processes. In these cases, artificial data can help shed light on pitfalls in decision making, and gain insights on optimized methods. The present paper uses the example of forecasts targeting the outcomes of sports events, representing a domain where despite the increasing complexity and coverage of models, the proposed methods may fail to identify the main sources of inaccuracy. While the actual outcome of the events provides a basis for validation, it remains unknown whether inaccurate forecasts source from misestimating the strength of each competitor, inaccurate forecasting methods or just from inherently random processes. To untangle this paradigm, the present paper proposes the design of a comprehensive simulation framework that models the sports forecasting process while having full control of all the underlying unknowns. A generalized model of the sports forecasting process is presented as the conceptual basis of the system and is supported by the main challenges of real-world data applications. The framework aims to provide a better understanding of rating procedures and forecasting techniques that will boost new developments and serve as a robust validation system accounting for the predictive quality of forecasts. As a proof of concept, a full data generation is showcased together with the main analytical advantages of using artificial data.; </jats:p>",20,3,551,580,Computer science; Process (computing); Machine learning; Quality (philosophy); Predictive modelling; Domain (mathematical analysis); Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Data science; Mathematical analysis; Philosophy; Mathematics; Epistemology; Operating system,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Deutsche Sporthochschule Köln (DSHS),https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10257-022-00560-9.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10257-022-00560-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10257-022-00560-9,,10.1007/s10257-022-00560-9,,,0,002-330-339-703-667; 003-027-113-051-015; 003-893-369-881-718; 004-277-741-995-429; 005-563-281-829-422; 007-510-726-471-720; 009-054-047-207-094; 009-495-416-178-924; 012-477-498-601-499; 014-947-428-832-87X; 015-332-594-441-538; 019-870-845-430-993; 020-812-630-892-357; 022-383-958-491-514; 025-300-525-712-433; 027-150-047-044-961; 028-247-229-306-27X; 029-200-290-675-371; 032-776-397-441-989; 033-191-523-698-666; 034-163-818-524-813; 035-553-169-872-286; 036-034-065-437-572; 036-450-141-526-159; 036-675-310-277-999; 036-820-220-922-163; 036-858-549-532-922; 037-328-918-657-797; 039-427-599-229-555; 040-096-806-289-078; 040-474-195-972-665; 042-700-456-694-102; 045-305-541-097-90X; 048-024-663-664-413; 049-984-444-879-021; 051-019-301-554-817; 053-829-949-210-74X; 060-895-121-786-975; 062-213-351-156-348; 062-391-870-656-59X; 065-024-559-398-545; 066-158-116-692-235; 066-243-406-052-814; 069-428-593-067-199; 072-166-051-266-995; 075-833-592-580-720; 080-135-549-079-554; 084-964-995-808-335; 090-113-604-442-674; 095-788-170-633-509; 096-000-550-841-414; 106-438-837-459-420; 108-172-880-331-032; 109-641-348-965-763; 110-413-136-783-07X; 110-510-842-185-282; 111-091-292-778-552; 113-774-067-152-540; 118-100-057-090-172; 119-621-763-579-282; 122-001-582-693-722; 122-195-250-610-634; 124-629-688-543-251; 129-160-630-538-683; 130-148-036-826-694; 132-952-136-473-726; 151-172-457-306-832; 153-301-603-887-809; 155-216-662-253-036; 199-173-981-509-78X,5,true,cc-by,hybrid
017-222-822-470-660,Exploring the Role of Spatial Visualization in Design Process of Undergraduate Engineering Students,2024-02-07,2024,conference proceedings article,2023 ASEE Annual Conference & Exposition Proceedings,,ASEE Conferences,,Gibin Raju; Sheryl Sorby; Clodagh Reid,"Abstract This research paper details a study investigating the relation between spatial visualization skills and design problem-solving for undergraduate engineering students. Design is outlined as one of the seven attributes that engineering students must demonstrate prior to their graduation as set out through the ABET guidelines. It is important to understand the factors that contribute to design capability in order to achieve this learning goal. Design problems by their nature are cognitive tasks and as such require problem solvers to draw both on learned knowledge and pertinent cognitive abilities. In the context of engineering design problem solving, spatial visualization is one such cognitive ability. Previous research has demonstrated a link between spatial visualization and design. This work aims to advance on that research by exploring how visualization relates to the creativity of designs produced by engineering students. There were three phases to data collection for this research. In the first phase, 127 undergraduate engineering students completed four spatial tests. In the second phase 101 students returned to complete three design tasks. This paper will focus on one of these tasks, the Ping Pong problem where individuals are asked to design a ping pong launcher to hit a target from a given distance at a specific height. A purposive sample of 9 freshmen students were selected to engage in a think aloud protocol during the problem based on their spatial visualization skills (high, mid and low). This think aloud protocol was used to develop design timelines for each of the 9 participants. The third phase of data collection involved an Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) session where engineering educators were asked to evaluate the Ping Pong problem solutions of all 101 participants based on creativity. This information was used to identify where the 9 participants with high, mid and low visualization were positioned in terms of creativity amongst the larger group.

We developed a linguistically based framework for criteria-based assessment, anchored in a functional view of language and language learning. The framework was used to determine what traits characterise texts at different Proficiency Groups based on comparative judgement and what traits characterise texts assessed differently. Altogether, 100 texts (written by students ages 6–9) representing four text genres were assessed and ranked using both comparative judgement (holistic assessment) and criteria-based analysis. The results indicate that texts generally are assessed as stronger (i.e., placed in a higher Proficiency Group) when comparative judgement is used than what the assessment of a specific language resource indicates. The results also indicate that assessment differences might be a result of different quality expectations for different genres. This points towards the need for genre- and subject-specific assessment criteria to scaffold students in their emergent disciplinary writing development.</jats:p>",13,1-3,,,Judgement; Writing assessment; Psychology; Linguistics; Subject (documents); Quality (philosophy); Mathematics education; Computer science; Philosophy; Epistemology; Library science; Political science; Law,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1558/wap.21504,,10.1558/wap.21504,,,0,,0,false,,
018-315-548-244-052,Analytic rubric scoring versus comparative judgment: a comparison of two approaches to assessing spoken-language interpreting,2021-11-02,2021,journal article,Meta,14921421; 00260452,Consortium Erudit,Canada,Chao Han,"In this article, we report on an empirical study conducted to evaluate the utility of analytic rubric scoring (ARS) vis-a-vis comparative judgment (CJ) as two approaches to assessing spoken-language interpreting. The primary motivation behind the study is that the potential advantages of CJ may make it a promising alternative to ARS. When conducting CJ on interpreting, judges need to compare two renditions and decide which one is of higher quality. Such binary decisions are then modeled statistically to produce a scaled rank order of the renditions from “worst” to “best.” We set up an experiment in which two groups of raters/judges of varying scoring expertise applied both CJ and ARS to assess 40 samples of English-Chinese consecutive interpreting. Our analysis of quantitative data suggests that overall ARS outperformed CJ in terms of validity, reliability, practicality and acceptability. Qualitative questionnaire data helped us obtain insights into the judges’/raters’ perceived advantages and disadvantages of CJ and ARS. Based on the findings, we tried to account for CJ’s underperformance vis-a-vis ARS, focusing on the specificities of interpreting assessment. We also propose potential avenues for future research to improve our understanding of interpreting assessment.",66,2,337,361,Rubric; Empirical research; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Set (psychology); Natural language processing; Spoken language; Quality (business); Questionnaire data; Reliability (statistics),,,,,https://www.erudit.org/fr/revues/meta/2021-v66-n2-meta06514/1083182ar.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7202/1083182ar,,10.7202/1083182ar,3214660453,,0,000-233-371-514-199; 003-422-625-053-401; 005-652-826-827-705; 008-928-694-487-22X; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-486-381-437-418; 025-685-895-808-301; 026-063-442-817-109; 028-600-184-401-058; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-344-474-727-386; 041-339-979-794-70X; 050-943-988-713-681; 061-367-472-809-785; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 070-451-630-425-882; 089-185-984-021-042; 098-611-978-567-247; 102-955-514-174-383; 106-532-502-155-602; 108-011-090-309-431; 145-591-602-199-471; 154-607-497-702-185; 163-379-589-157-078; 173-293-063-566-147,2,true,,gold

These polytopes have been described geometrically in terms of submodular functions. We show that they can also be viewed in terms of tournaments with cooperative and solitaire games, as well as the usual competitive games in classical graph tournaments. We establish a Coxeter analogue of Moon's classical theorem, regarding mean score sequences of random tournaments. We present a geometric proof by the Mirsky--Thompson generalized Birkhoff's theorem, a probabilistic proof by Strassen's coupling theorem, and an algorithmic proof by a Coxeter analogue of the Havel--Hakimi algorithm. These proofs have natural interpretations in terms of players seeking out potential competitors/collaborators with respect to their relative weakness/strength. We also observe that the Bradley--Terry model, from the statistical theory of paired comparisons, extends to the Coxeter setting. Finally, we show that an analogue of Landau's classical theorem, concerning deterministic tournaments, holds for balanced Coxeter tournaments.",,,,,Coxeter group; Mathematics; Combinatorics; Longest element of a Coxeter group; Coxeter element; Mathematical proof; Coxeter complex; Discrete mathematics; Artin group; Geometry,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2302.14002,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2302.14002,,10.48550/arxiv.2302.14002,,,0,,0,true,,green

The results revealed that COVID-19's pandemic effects on financial markets differ between developed and developing nations. COVID-19 pandemic affects developed countries' financial markets more through supply reduction, demand reduction, and economic instability. Regarding developing nations, confidence and expectations, changes in consumption patterns, and the bandwagon effect are the three most significant impacts of COVID-19 pandemic on financial markets. The best decisions to lower the effect of COVID-19 pandemic on developed nations' financial markets are the declaration of the stimulus package and support of small-and-medium-sized enterprises. Contrastingly, in developing countries, support for vulnerable households and declaration of the stimulus package are the best decisions to combat COVID-19's negative impact on their financial markets.

There have been studies in the literature to describe the phenomenon by means of clinical grading, instrumental measurement and image analysis. However, due to its subjective and complex nature, skin translucency has not been comprehensively and rigorously characterized and modelled, particularly in the Chinese population. This study is to develop a mathematical model that quantitatively describes skin translucency from visual cues objectively measured from the skin.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""MATERIALS AND METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">The study was designed to characterize and model skin translucency by incorporating expert evaluation, panel perception and image analysis of multiple skin visual attributes in one analysis. Faces of 36 Chinese females aged 18-65 years old were evaluated by a dermatologist to obtain clinical translucency scores. Subject pairs were formed with a relatively high and low translucency score in each pair. Their faces were judged in person by 9 panellists in paired-comparison (2-AFC) fashion to pick a 'more translucent skin' from each subject pair. Front-view facial images of the subjects were taken, and multiple colour and other visually perceivable skin attributes were measured using image analysis. Bradley-Terry analysis and multiple regressions were performed to correlate the panel choices of 'more translucent skin' with the objectively measured skin parameters.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">Multiple skin colour properties affected the panel choices towards translucent skin. Among them skin tone lightness and skin glossiness had positive effects on skin translucency while the hue, colour unevenness, severity of red and dark spots affected it negatively. Subsurface light reflection and skin visual smoothness had some effect but were not statistically significant. A mathematical model was constructed to predict a person's skin translucency from objectively measured skin attributes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">The subjective property of skin translucency can be characterized and quantified via a comprehensive modelling process involving clinical grading, panel evaluation, image-based measurement of skin attributes and statistical analysis. A novel skin parameter, Skin Translucency Index (STI) was established, which provides a way to measure skin translucency, making it possible to assess treatment efficacy before and after product application.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022 Society of Cosmetic Scientists and Societe Francaise de Cosmetologie.</CopyrightInformation>",44,5,500,513,Skin color; Grading (engineering); Population; Dark skin; Skin colour; Psychology; Medicine; Dermatology; Artificial intelligence; Computer science; Engineering; Environmental health; Civil engineering,computer modelling; image analysis; paired comparison; skin physiology/structure; skin translucency; statistics,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Asian People; China; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Skin/diagnostic imaging; Skin Pigmentation; Young Adult,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/ics.12798,35775143,10.1111/ics.12798,,,0,004-414-436-917-174; 012-832-726-022-004; 016-730-148-174-142; 023-335-782-798-474; 026-917-114-177-188; 030-358-164-110-797; 038-176-017-935-688; 043-787-708-089-12X; 046-156-081-282-695; 050-997-889-035-380; 053-021-356-318-323; 054-416-118-167-446; 057-527-329-455-502; 058-011-535-902-261; 059-716-645-164-585; 064-772-441-812-322; 069-905-723-324-771; 071-027-884-931-64X; 073-854-480-305-150; 073-930-768-214-647; 074-122-382-463-772; 081-370-959-105-221; 090-944-041-813-722; 093-734-557-226-215; 110-534-399-386-907; 114-436-316-896-124; 120-409-607-160-68X; 143-608-155-245-186,1,false,,

The latter method was used for comparative judgment of GTPA samples to identify exemplar performances that illustrate a range of quality and more specifically, the overall standard at the passing or threshold level. The research team undertook an inquiry into what each of the two methods could contribute to standard setting.

Crompvoets; Anton A. Béguin; Klaas Sijtsma,"<jats:p>Comparative judgment is a method that allows measurement of a competence by comparison of items with other items. In educational measurement, where comparative judgment is becoming an increasingly popular assessment method, items are mostly students’ responses to an assignment or an examination. For assessments using comparative judgment, the Scale Separation Reliability (SSR) is used to estimate the reliability of the measurement. Previous research has shown that the SSR may overestimate reliability when the pairs to be compared are selected with certain adaptive algorithms, when raters use different underlying models/truths, or when the true variance of the item parameters is below one. This research investigated bias and stability of the components of the SSR in relation to the number of comparisons per item to increase understanding of the SSR. We showed that many comparisons are required to obtain an accurate estimate of the item variance, but that the SSR can be useful even when the variance of the items is overestimated. Lastly, we recommend adjusting the general guideline for the required number of comparisons per item to 41 comparisons per item. This recommendation partly depends on the number of items and the true variance in our simulation study and needs further investigation.</jats:p>",6,,,,Variance (accounting); Reliability (semiconductor); Statistics; Competence (human resources); Stability (learning theory); Computer science; Psychology; Econometrics; Mathematics; Social psychology; Machine learning; Power (physics); Physics; Accounting; Quantum mechanics; Business,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.788202/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.788202 https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/files/60484741/Crompvoets_et_al_2022_.pdf https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/c19dacbf-bae9-4761-92ad-3c3fc463c35f https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/60484741/Crompvoets_et_al_2022_.pdf https://osf.io/kq4jh/download https://osf.io/kq4jh/ https://psyarxiv.com/kq4jh/download https://psyarxiv.com/kq4jh/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.788202,,10.3389/feduc.2021.788202,,,0,001-098-070-996-486; 007-467-244-739-842; 015-035-210-409-280; 020-492-282-615-504; 022-886-709-886-069; 025-009-658-071-875; 026-506-897-501-75X; 035-966-099-589-64X; 042-262-850-601-237; 045-341-366-262-32X; 048-151-229-726-003; 081-370-959-105-221; 093-041-634-863-567; 104-108-572-407-187; 123-212-204-814-685; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-659-660-814-933; 148-673-033-661-432; 157-189-775-028-646,1,true,cc-by,gold

  Comparisons",2023-08-16,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Julien Fageot; Sadegh Farhadkhani; Lê Nguyên Hoang; Oscar Villemaud,"Many applications, e.g. in content recommendation, sports, or recruitment, leverage the comparisons of alternatives to score those alternatives. The classical Bradley-Terry model and its variants have been widely used to do so. The historical model considers binary comparisons (victory or defeat) between alternatives, while more recent developments allow finer comparisons to be taken into account. In this article, we introduce a probabilistic model encompassing a broad variety of paired comparisons that can take discrete or continuous values. We do so by considering a well-behaved subset of the exponential family, which we call the family of generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT) models, as it includes the classical Bradley-Terry model and many of its variants. Remarkably, we prove that all GBT models are guaranteed to yield a strictly convex negative log-likelihood. Moreover, assuming a Gaussian prior on alternatives' scores, we prove that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of GBT models, whose existence, uniqueness and fast computation are thus guaranteed, varies monotonically with respect to comparisons (the more A beats B, the better the score of A) and is Lipschitz-resilient with respect to each new comparison (a single new comparison can only have a bounded effect on all the estimated scores). These desirable properties make GBT models appealing for practical use. We illustrate some features of GBT models on simulations.",,,,,Leverage (statistics); Bounded function; Uniqueness; Exponential family; Probabilistic logic; Monotonic function; Mathematics; Econometrics; Computer science; Mathematical economics; Applied mathematics; Mathematical optimization; Statistics; Mathematical analysis,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08644,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.08644,,10.48550/arxiv.2308.08644,,,0,,0,true,,green

This can be due to a variety of factors such as concreteness and word type.  Cross-linguistic orthographic similarity, whether the combination and position of letters within words conform to native language spelling rules, also plays an important role. Very little is known however, about the effect of cross-linguistic orthographic similarity in different learning contexts. The current research therefore examines this with participants learning Welsh (Study 1) and Polish (Study 2) words through incidental and intentional learning tasks before completing meaning recall and translation recognition tasks. Cross-linguistic orthographic similarity was measured using the comparative judgement approach.

Inefficiency is mainly caused by biased inference, or by inattentional (feature) blindness (i.e., some elements or their features are not processed). Here, we define inattentional feature blindness as an inability to perceive the value(s) of certain feature(s) of an object while the presence of the object itself may be registered. Separation of the effects of inattentional (feature) blindness and perceptual noise has escaped traditional analytic methods because of their trade-off effects on the slope of the psychometric discrimination function. Here, we propose a method that can separate the effects of inattentional feature blindness from that of the representational noise. The basic idea is to display a set of elements from which only one contains information relevant for solving the task, while all other elements are “dummies” carrying no useful information because they do not differ from the reference. If the single informative element goes unprocessed, the correct answer can only be given by a random guess. The guess rate can be modeled similarly to the lapse rate, traditionally represented by λ. As an illustration, we present evidence that the presence versus lack of inattentional feature blindness in orientation pooling depends on the feature types present in the display.",83,3,1282,1289,Artificial intelligence; Set (psychology); Pattern recognition; Perception; Inference; Object (philosophy); Computer science; Pooling; Feature (computer vision); Orientation (computer vision); Noise (video),Ensemble perception; Inattentional feature blindness; Lapsing rate; Representational noise,Attention; Blindness; Humans; Orientation; Visual Perception,,Eesti Teadusagentuur (MOBTP91),https://europepmc.org/article/MED/33655426 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/33655426 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-020-02234-5,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-020-02234-5,33655426,10.3758/s13414-020-02234-5,3133573470,,0,000-405-390-557-969; 001-529-878-461-937; 003-198-583-089-698; 004-063-291-705-127; 005-589-187-502-728; 006-791-051-768-178; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-803-701-547-124; 011-249-351-947-371; 013-107-922-688-385; 018-640-215-452-274; 018-807-296-668-916; 019-129-400-834-889; 020-545-251-512-779; 020-807-167-419-368; 024-595-422-424-118; 028-183-827-153-760; 031-324-485-402-628; 031-495-429-097-178; 031-547-776-718-970; 032-224-200-485-406; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-142-702-847-240; 044-069-241-877-260; 044-576-839-282-073; 045-239-748-926-223; 048-766-933-202-837; 051-676-597-036-970; 052-382-568-670-975; 056-600-005-793-064; 057-472-267-307-954; 062-592-991-102-893; 067-631-252-449-755; 071-179-191-100-774; 078-479-099-650-852; 081-155-610-461-715; 083-405-990-852-057; 098-950-277-295-601; 109-402-746-487-551; 134-804-192-468-372; 135-357-773-691-016; 136-267-720-758-624; 156-626-439-310-315; 171-028-407-851-268,4,true,,bronze

Previous research has explored methods to surface alarming privacy policies using manual labelers, natural language processing, and deep learning techniques. However, this prior work used pre-determined categories for annotations, and did not investigate what consumers really deem as important from their perspective. In this paper, we instead combine crowdsourcing with an open definition of ""what is important"" in T&Cs. We present a workflow consisting of pairwise comparisons, agreement validation, and Bradley-Terry rank modeling, to effectively establish rankings of T&C statements from non-expert crowdworkers on this open definition, and further analyzed consumers' preferences. We applied this workflow to 1,551 T&C statements from 27 e-commerce websites, contributed by 3,462 unique crowd workers doing 203,068 pairwise comparisons, and conducted thematic and readability analysis on the statements considered as important/unimportant. We found that consumers especially cared about policies related to after-sales and money, and tended to regard harder-to-understand statements as more important. We also present machine learning models to identify T&C clauses that consumers considered important, achieving at best a 92.7% balanced accuracy, 91.6% recall, and 89.2% precision. We foresee using our workflow and model to efficiently and reliably highlight important T&Cs on websites at a large scale, improving consumers' awareness",,,,,Rank (computer programming); Privacy policy; Deep learning; Artificial intelligence; Workflow; Pairwise comparison; Data science; Readability; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Scale (social sciences),,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.12182 https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12182 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2111.12182 http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/abs/2111.12182 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2111.html#abs-2111-12182,https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.12182,,,3215615937,,0,002-120-146-278-355; 004-241-113-635-09X; 006-101-714-460-131; 015-113-238-015-110; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-370-734-302-195; 031-077-669-014-667; 032-011-705-884-825; 039-248-167-107-454; 044-654-043-485-124; 047-238-370-528-992; 050-966-669-826-904; 058-400-973-828-144; 058-960-804-221-136; 059-009-792-404-590; 061-740-509-480-921; 063-401-015-839-419; 063-709-976-759-769; 064-520-075-914-183; 066-116-391-314-583; 069-712-206-090-830; 074-307-907-814-119; 081-370-959-105-221; 091-167-039-403-161; 093-151-007-792-250; 093-708-236-531-324; 095-891-419-200-57X; 104-512-929-235-758; 110-817-863-033-997; 129-216-727-016-961; 147-296-117-460-534; 148-104-544-874-085; 168-067-760-130-203; 172-973-133-298-655,0,true,,unknown

This process has traditionally relied on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, which made labelling expensive and difficult to scale. A more scalable approach would be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, but maintaining high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability when using non-expert workers can be challenging. This paper reports on two experiments in which non-expert crowdworkers hired to evaluate (i.e., score) student work and were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were asked to assign a rubrics based score (i.e., a categorical judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same student answers, but were asked to decide which of two candidate answers was better (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human feedback on model outputs. These results are novel and important in demonstrating the effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and crowdworkers to evaluate educational data",,,,,Judgement; Rubric; Computer science; Categorical variable; Reliability (semiconductor); Scale (ratio); Artificial intelligence; Field (mathematics); Machine learning; Data science; Mathematics education; Psychology; Mathematics; Power (physics); Physics; Political science; Pure mathematics; Law; Quantum mechanics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.12894 https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12894,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3573051.3596198,,10.1145/3573051.3596198,,,0,002-865-363-896-076; 015-776-457-261-327; 017-442-768-015-038; 022-486-381-437-418; 031-056-855-501-837; 032-061-006-970-033; 037-538-643-802-611; 046-885-708-774-897; 054-487-078-903-100; 102-955-514-174-383; 118-684-649-570-075; 127-321-514-059-281,0,true,,green

Suvorova; Alina A. Karelina,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Recent initiatives to promote ‘digitalization’ in education exhorting increased digital literacy and ‘computational thinking’ have invited implementation research methods to transform curricula, teaching, and learning. While conceived as a movement from the present of education to an imagined future where envisaged curricula embrace data-oriented and computational practices across subjects, we ask: whose present? Whose future? We revisit the concept of a metacurriculum (first conceived in the 1990s) as a way of addressing this question, while not avoiding the challenges inherent in the adaptation of education to an increasingly complex postdigital environment. We argue that the principal challenge facing institutional and individual adaptation is increasing environmental uncertainty produced by technology, not deficiency in individual skills. Using the uncertainty concept, we present a practical co-designed and dialogical approach supporting the student and teacher journeys towards the transdisciplinary opportunities opened out by technology, based on a cybernetic model of intersubjectivity. We discuss the explanatory power of uncertainty in this context, focusing on the ways it can encourage dialogue, collegiality, and experimentation. Evidence for this is presented in a case study from a Russian University Business School where a large group of teachers co-designed and delivered a dialogical module on digitalization and interdisciplinarity over a period of 4 years—a collaboration ended by recent geopolitical events. In analyzing data from one of the central activities of this course, we focus on the teacher collegiality and the students’ mechanisms of selection in navigating the transdisciplinary space, and how these mechanisms may provide deeper insight into the dialogical underpinnings of education.; </jats:p>",4,3,772,792,Dialogical self; Collegiality; Curriculum; Sociology; Context (archaeology); Pedagogy; Teacher education; Educational technology; Sociology of Education; Engineering ethics; Higher education; Mathematics education; Psychology; Political science; Engineering; Social psychology; Paleontology; Law; Biology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s42438-022-00324-1.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s42438-022-00324-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s42438-022-00324-1,,10.1007/s42438-022-00324-1,,,0,008-534-636-628-467; 035-357-782-975-701; 036-536-639-503-306; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-531-718-226-995; 051-478-263-929-43X; 061-909-564-104-217; 079-480-184-867-487; 090-405-331-616-855; 093-181-444-325-973; 113-481-469-021-915; 136-782-558-871-421; 140-961-708-021-034; 145-987-538-567-524; 146-430-617-222-565; 149-023-817-781-901; 149-802-951-156-464; 157-700-297-714-953; 187-816-517-356-223; 187-968-670-739-290,3,true,cc-by,hybrid

In 2021, the county of Nottinghamshire, UK, launched a strategy to tackle forced marriage and violence against women and girls. However, accessing information about where victims are located in the county could compromise their safety, so it is not possible to develop interventions for different areas of the county. Comparative judgement studies offer a way to map the risk of human rights abuses without collecting data that could compromise victim safety. Current methods require studies to have a large number of participants, so we develop a comparative judgement model that provides a more flexible spatial modelling structure and a mechanism to schedule comparisons more effectively. The methods reduce the data collection burden on participants and make a comparative judgement study feasible with a small number of participants. Underpinning these methods is a latent variable representation that improves on the scalability of previous comparative judgement models.

But there is no extant account of what typically makes typical legal systems coercive when they are coercive. This paper presents such an account and compares it with four alternative views. Towards the end I discuss the proposed account’s payoffs. Among other things, I show how it can help us explain what I call ‘comparative judgements’ about coercive legal systems (judgements such as ‘Legal system a is more coercive than legal system b’) and how it can help the development of social scientific inquiries into the coerciveness of our legal systems.",107,2,235,250,Political science; Extant taxon; Law and economics; Politics,,,,,https://elibrary.verlagoesterreich.at/article/10.25162/arsp-2021-0013 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2Fabec9758-9ee3-45e8-a52f-66dbf6a7c1a5 https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/what-makes-law-coercive-when-it-is-coercive,http://dx.doi.org/10.25162/arsp-2021-0013,,10.25162/arsp-2021-0013,3182022424,,0,,2,true,,green

In particular, paired comparison approaches make use of latent ability estimates or rating calculations to determine the probability that a player will win a match. In this paper, we extend this latter class of models by using network indicators for the predictions. We propose a measure based on eigenvector centrality. Unlike what happens for the standard paired comparisons class (where the rates or latent abilities only change at time <i>t</i> for those players involved in the matches at time <i>t</i>), the use of a centrality measure allows the ratings of the whole set of players to vary every time there is a new match. The resulting ratings are then used as a covariate in a simple logit model. Evaluating the proposed approach with respect to some popular competing specifications, we find that the centrality-based approach largely and consistently outperforms all the alternative models considered in terms of the prediction accuracy. Finally, the proposed method also achieves positive betting results.",325,1,615,632,Centrality; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Class (philosophy); Popularity; Measure (data warehouse); Covariate; Machine learning; Econometrics; Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Mathematics; Statistics; Psychology; Social psychology; Programming language,Eigenvector centrality; Forecasting; Network; Tennis,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7 https://iris.uniroma1.it/bitstream/11573/1618746/1/Arcagni_new-model_2022.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/11573/1618746,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7,35283548,10.1007/s10479-022-04594-7,,PMC8900648,0,002-786-376-452-452; 002-837-065-590-206; 012-477-498-601-499; 023-902-600-788-506; 031-934-787-614-202; 032-640-613-029-030; 032-776-397-441-989; 034-163-818-524-813; 036-257-291-948-248; 040-715-279-813-842; 042-944-280-318-314; 043-220-459-638-302; 046-394-765-628-689; 048-024-663-664-413; 063-611-485-939-065; 068-444-873-880-436; 068-691-401-174-03X; 093-155-519-399-573; 094-775-789-357-959; 096-000-550-841-414; 096-267-774-111-106; 105-127-902-669-64X; 106-554-101-637-253; 129-827-423-483-811; 167-873-525-355-250,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Its most popular version says that it is rationally mandatory to choose a way of life that seeks to cultivate belief in God because this is the option of maximum expected utility. Despite its initial attractiveness, this long-standing argument has been subject to various criticisms by many philosophers. What is less discussed, however, is the rationality of this choice in situations where the decision-makers are confronted with greater uncertainty. In this paper, I examine the imprecise version of Pascal’s Wager: those scenarios where an agent’s credence that God exists is imprecise or vague rather than precise. After introducing some technical background on imprecise probabilities, I apply five different principles for decision-making to two cases of state uncertainty. In the final part of the paper, I argue that it is not rationally permitted to include zero as the lower probability of God’s existence. Although the conditions for what makes an act uniquely optimal vary significantly across those principles, I also show how the option of wagering for God can defeat any mixed strategy under two distinct interpretations of salvation.",51,3,1479,1508,Credence; Epistemology; Rationality; Theism; Pascal (unit); Ambiguity; Philosophy of language; Philosophy of science; Philosophy; Argument (complex analysis); Decision theory; Mathematical economics; Economics; Computer science; Metaphysics; Microeconomics; Linguistics; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Machine learning; Programming language,,,,John Templeton Foundation,https://philpapers.org/archive/NEIPWA-2.pdf https://philarchive.org/rec/NEIPWA-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11406-022-00586-w,,10.1007/s11406-022-00586-w,,,0,004-526-211-866-181; 012-436-440-756-577; 013-451-943-078-60X; 013-954-401-757-91X; 014-379-445-544-770; 016-764-603-940-212; 017-392-979-358-556; 017-439-290-664-903; 023-954-188-618-20X; 035-251-726-994-398; 035-911-878-303-921; 039-851-249-568-218; 045-313-021-185-164; 047-712-042-055-503; 056-358-153-140-249; 063-634-115-755-025; 071-238-877-061-041; 073-545-496-885-728; 076-520-103-828-887; 079-757-401-578-462; 089-233-840-759-367; 089-744-663-351-030; 125-679-335-659-963; 133-090-001-371-327; 133-321-730-347-023; 168-139-863-971-021; 186-694-920-902-061,0,true,,green

This paper explores a quite different method of assessment using ‘Adaptive Comparative Judgement’ (ACJ) that was developed within a research project at Goldsmiths University of London between 2004 and 2010. The method was developed into a tool that enabled judges to distinguish better/worse performances not by allocating numbers through mark schemes, but rather by direct, holistic, judgement. The tool was successfully deployed through a series of national and international research and development exercises. But game-changing innovations are never flaw-less first time out (Golley, Jet: Frank Whittle and the Invention of the Jet Engine, Datum Publishing, Liphook Hampshire, 2009; Dyson, Against the odds: an autobiography, Texere Publishing, Knutsford Cheshire, 2001) and a series of careful investigations resulted in a problem being identified within the workings of ACJ (Bramley, Investigating the reliability of Adaptive Comparative Judgment, Cambridge Assessment Research Report, UK, Cambridge, 2015). The issue was with the ‘adaptive’ component of the algorithm that, under certain conditions, appeared to exaggerate the reliability statistic. The problem was ‘worked’ by the software company running ACJ and a solution found. This paper reports the whole sequence of events—from the original innovation, through deployment, the emergent problem, and the resulting solution that was published at an international conference (Rangel Smith and Lynch in: PATT36 International Conference.

Numerous participatory approaches proposed by CGIAR and other research teams over the last four decades have attempted to capture farmers' priorities/preferences and crop variety field performance in representative growing environments through experimental trials with higher external validity. Yet none have overcome the challenges of scalability, data validity and reliability, and difficulties in capturing socio-economic and environmental heterogeneity. Building on the strengths of these attempts, we developed a new data-generation approach, called <i>triadic comparison of technology options</i> (tricot). Tricot is a decentralized experimental approach supported by crowdsourced citizen science. In this article, we review the development, validation, and evolution of the tricot approach, through our own research results and reviewing the literature in which tricot approaches have been successfully applied. The first results indicated that tricot-aggregated farmer-led assessments contained information with adequate validity and that reliability could be achieved with a large sample. Costs were lower than current participatory approaches. Scaling the tricot approach into a large on-farm testing network successfully registered specific climatic effects of crop variety performance in representative growing environments. Tricot's recent application in plant breeding networks in relation to decision-making has (i) advanced plant breeding lines recognizing socio-economic heterogeneity, and (ii) identified consumers' preferences and market demands, generating alternative breeding design priorities. We review lessons learned from tricot applications that have enabled a large scaling effort, which should lead to stronger decision-making in crop improvement and increased use of improved varieties in smallholder agriculture.",44,1,8,,Agile software development; Knowledge management; Engineering management; Process management; Agriculture; Business; Computer science; Engineering; Software engineering; Ecology; Biology,External validity; Participatory plant breeding; Socio-economic heterogeneity; Target product profile,,,Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-031561) United States; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-008567) United States; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-018951) United States; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-007637) United States; Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation (INV-009649) United States,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13593-023-00937-1.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00937-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13593-023-00937-1,38282889,10.1007/s13593-023-00937-1,,PMC10811175,0,005-791-869-518-750; 008-274-528-761-959; 008-506-751-893-153; 008-623-653-515-936; 011-543-598-007-856; 013-126-606-993-146; 013-454-270-405-867; 019-977-987-079-393; 021-526-803-476-474; 024-414-716-458-756; 024-700-472-521-92X; 025-856-641-798-370; 026-251-136-739-593; 027-045-857-753-765; 027-714-763-064-032; 028-195-322-173-027; 028-202-418-669-468; 028-433-083-624-652; 029-510-004-774-832; 030-549-587-598-968; 031-489-252-159-730; 035-140-205-098-289; 035-798-565-605-564; 037-830-427-976-56X; 042-306-488-586-995; 045-687-188-334-711; 045-997-178-669-925; 046-596-799-103-800; 051-723-830-671-065; 054-625-946-644-130; 054-808-198-998-321; 057-463-607-771-119; 057-957-900-989-950; 061-851-508-060-417; 063-102-431-615-369; 067-848-481-867-296; 074-255-824-079-516; 079-011-726-795-309; 079-668-708-854-746; 083-692-404-783-154; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-000-785-122-98X; 089-410-683-777-629; 089-679-999-409-293; 094-744-634-619-297; 099-019-520-641-488; 103-808-981-110-035; 108-784-569-028-003; 109-468-428-010-32X; 110-638-393-890-56X; 119-207-516-385-997; 119-615-840-812-367; 125-623-843-870-797; 129-146-626-403-574; 130-333-154-626-188; 133-084-409-177-703; 135-981-729-915-026; 136-997-337-921-550; 143-910-373-749-398; 146-364-956-646-343; 147-816-573-561-917; 150-079-824-767-129; 160-693-976-370-094; 165-801-282-159-152; 173-617-601-122-008; 175-599-503-833-910; 175-890-246-243-007; 192-071-789-007-470; 195-564-794-414-606,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

[et al.],17088240; 14964155,Wiley,United States,Wen Luo; Stephen Westland; Yuan Li; Andrew Joiner,"Objective To identify the hue angles that provide the optimal perception of tooth whitening. Methods Thirty-three male/female adult observers with normal color vision were recruited to assess teeth images on a color calibrated display. Images of teeth were generated which simulated color changes in each of eight hue directions in the CIE a*b* plane, each equi-distant from a baseline tooth color. Using a paired comparison study design, observers were asked to indicate which of two images had whiter teeth. The data were converted into an interval scale using Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment. The relationship between the hue angles and the scores was modeled by curve fitting. Results The optimal hues were found in a region between green and blue in the CIE a*b chart. When the tooth color travels in an optimal hue direction, the same amount of color change will result in a greater change in whiteness perception than when traveling in other hue directions. Conclusions The optimal hues for tooth whitening were identified from the visual perception study. The most effective tooth whitening direction is to change tooth color towards the greenish-blue hue direction.

This task is commonly referred to as complex word identification (CWI) and is often modelled as a supervised classification problem. For training such systems, annotated datasets in which words and sometimes multi-word expressions are labelled regarding complexity are required. In this paper we analyze previous work carried out in this task and investigate the properties of CWI datasets for English. We develop a protocol for the annotation of lexical complexity and use this to annotate a new dataset, CompLex 2.0. We present experiments using both new and old datasets to investigate the nature of lexical complexity. We found that a Likert-scale annotation protocol provides an objective setting that is superior for identifying the complexity of words compared to a binary annotation protocol. We release a new dataset using our new protocol to promote the task of Lexical Complexity Prediction.</jats:p>",56,4,1153,1194,Computer science; Natural language processing; Annotation; Task (project management); Readability; Artificial intelligence; Word (group theory); Binary classification; Identification (biology); Protocol (science); Lexical analysis; Information retrieval; Linguistics; Support vector machine; Medicine; Philosophy; Botany; Alternative medicine; Management; Pathology; Economics; Biology; Programming language,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10579-022-09588-2.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10579-022-09588-2 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2102.08773 https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.08773 https://wlv.openrepository.com/bitstream/2436/624697/3/Shardlow_Predicting_Lexical_Complexity_2022.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/2436/624697 https://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/629988/8/Shardlow2022_Article_PredictingLexicalComplexityInE.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10579-022-09588-2,,10.1007/s10579-022-09588-2,,,0,002-088-187-132-056; 003-264-339-475-872; 004-271-539-521-724; 004-877-171-081-463; 005-998-722-476-929; 007-000-556-514-029; 008-296-372-473-48X; 010-549-304-372-139; 015-055-124-162-179; 017-908-286-271-751; 018-193-483-515-989; 020-013-648-569-012; 023-597-893-463-968; 028-667-048-708-860; 030-482-566-957-358; 030-640-572-894-534; 031-829-688-029-409; 034-610-452-726-227; 034-610-591-038-600; 038-382-595-724-45X; 044-312-746-022-10X; 045-597-172-233-554; 045-600-800-095-813; 050-899-671-589-525; 052-167-567-263-508; 055-414-923-015-776; 057-032-583-128-406; 057-761-925-937-036; 060-987-521-081-972; 063-944-158-250-24X; 067-529-185-693-860; 069-351-967-965-215; 069-375-829-975-083; 073-192-970-520-208; 073-991-682-612-045; 074-337-657-992-058; 075-908-908-815-48X; 079-155-449-934-19X; 083-955-745-666-353; 084-434-309-201-085; 090-283-612-169-104; 094-733-067-728-767; 095-670-225-088-357; 096-782-675-435-70X; 099-419-685-928-498; 100-397-518-173-402; 100-697-679-452-909; 104-067-418-964-139; 106-721-838-540-152; 108-577-355-258-91X; 110-453-720-128-038; 114-519-384-571-464; 115-353-325-732-052; 119-477-231-270-336; 128-116-229-882-141; 130-916-819-339-023; 136-772-795-967-41X; 137-320-213-389-496; 139-349-078-885-770; 157-199-867-394-466; 161-409-612-445-644; 162-198-870-778-15X; 170-332-350-566-086,2,true,cc-by,hybrid
029-843-833-496-791,CAN COMPARATIVE JUDGEMENT IMPROVE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCT-SERVICE SYSTEM DESIGN FOR STUDENTS,,2021,conference proceedings article,DS 110: Proceedings of the 23rd International Conference on Engineering and Product Design Education (EPDE 2021),,The Design Society,,Ivo Dewit; David Corradi; Maarten Goossens,"One issue within current product development literature entails, both with students and with professionals, the reliable scaling and the objective assessment of products. This article will attempt to describe a way how Masters students at a university, within a product development case, can both assess each other, assess the process of product development, and assess the final product using comparative judgement. This, while achieving learning goals described at master level. A growing body of literature is finding support for the notion that comparative judgment can help learners and assessors in different learning and working situations. Comparative judgement asks an assessor to compare two products and ranks one product over the other. These products can be both small scale – such as a short presentation, a paper or a drawing; and large-scale such as a masters’ thesis or a full fledge solution to a real life solution to a problem. Studies indicate such comparative judgement can be used during a learning process. Learners are taught to think why product a is better than product b, and learn to articulate why a product is better. This thinking process is often referred to as metacognition, whereby the learner attempts to understand all intricate aspects why a product is better than another one. Compared to using rubrics, the comparative assessment is usually done in terms of holistic processes, whereby the whole is more than its aspects, or when it comes to designing with increased complexity, e.g., product-service systems (PSS). Rubrics usually divide the product into small aspects, a presentation is subdivided into criteria on layout, on persuasive message, and so on, where each criterium receives a separate score. Comparative judgement, on the other hand, focusses on the entire product and compares the entire product as such into a holistic process. Comparing multiple products multiple times leads to a ranking of products and connected to that a reliability score, and an ability score. The reliability score is an indication of the chance a different group of assessors might get a similar ranking. A score above .7 (ranging from 0 to 1) is considered decent reliability. An ability score refers to the amount of time a product has been considered the better (or worse) choice or option compared to a range of other products, and also influences the final ranking. The current study evaluates how first year Master students (n=72) apply comparative judgement using an online tool, Comproved (Comproved.com) during a semester-long group project on PSS design, and compares this to how assessors use this in a product development cycle. Based on post hoc questionnaire details and interviews, we will list the advantages and the disadvantages of comparative judgement, as stated by the both students and assessors. Finally, we will list the potentials of comparative judgement during product development cycles and their impact on product quality, reliability of judgement and metacognitive strategies for learning.",,,,,Rubric; Metacognition; Product (category theory); New product development; Process management; Ranking; Judgement; Quality (business); Computer science; Final product,,,,,https://www.designsociety.org/publication/43498/CAN+COMPARATIVE+JUDGEMENT+IMPROVE+PRODUCT+DEVELOPMENT+AND+PRODUCT-SERVICE+SYSTEM+DESIGN+FOR+STUDENTS https://www.designsociety.org/download-publication/43498/CAN+COMPARATIVE+JUDGEMENT+IMPROVE+PRODUCT+DEVELOPMENT+AND+PRODUCT-SERVICE+SYSTEM+DESIGN+FOR+STUDENTS,http://dx.doi.org/10.35199/epde.2021.34,,10.35199/epde.2021.34,3192080060,,0,007-787-338-181-694; 007-840-977-956-003; 009-528-209-497-955; 028-358-749-840-291; 032-327-336-882-576; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 057-487-318-922-175; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-690-139-115-880; 077-080-474-170-543; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-148-841-586-276; 127-659-660-814-933; 130-372-764-226-052; 149-874-847-118-380; 165-708-633-922-222,0,true,,bronze

The problem of ranking a large number of items from noisy and sparse pairwise comparison data arises in diverse applications, like ranking players in online games, document retrieval or ranking human perceptions. Although different algorithms are available, we need fast, large-scale algorithms whose accuracy degrades gracefully when the number of comparisons is too small. Fitting our proposed model entails solving a non-convex optimization problem, which we tightly approximate by a sum of quasi-convex functions and a regularization term. Resorting to an iterative reweighted minimization and the Primal-Dual Hybrid Gradient method, we obtain PD-Rank, achieving a Kendall tau 0.1 higher than all comparing methods, even for 10\% of wrong comparisons in simulated data matching our data model, and leading in accuracy if data is generated according to the Bradley-Terry model, in both cases faster by one order of magnitude, in seconds. In real data, PD-Rank requires less computational time to achieve the same Kendall tau than active learning methods.",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Ranking SVM; Ranking (information retrieval); Leverage (statistics); Regularization (linguistics); Convex optimization; Generative model; Hinge loss; Algorithm; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Regular polygon; Mathematics; Support vector machine; Generative grammar; Geometry,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.01670,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2202.01670,,10.48550/arxiv.2202.01670,,,0,,0,true,,green
030-548-969-868-105,The Bayesian Spatial Bradley-Terry Model: Urban Deprivation Modelling in Tanzania,2021-10-27,2021,,,,,,Rowland G Seymour; David Sirl; Simon Preston; Ian L. Dryden; Madeleine J A Ellis; Bertrand Perrat; James Goulding,"Identifying the most deprived regions of any country or city is key if policy makers are to design successful interventions. However, locating areas with the greatest need is often surprisingly challenging in developing countries. Due to the logistical challenges of traditional household surveying, official statistics can be slow to be updated; estimates that exist can be coarse, a consequence of prohibitive costs and poor infrastructures; and mass urbanisation can render manually surveyed figures rapidly out-of-date. Comparative judgement models, such as the Bradley-Terry model, offer a promising solution. Lever-aging local knowledge, elicited via comparisons of different areas' affluence, such models can both simplify logistics and circumvent biases inherent to household surveys. Yet widespread adoption remains limited, due to the large amount of data existing approaches still require. We address this via development of a novel Bayesian Spatial Bradley-Terry model, which substantially decreases the number of comparisons required for effective inference. This model integrates a network representation of the city or country, along with assumptions of spatial smoothness that allow deprivation in one area to be informed by neighbouring areas. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of this method, through a novel comparative judgement data set collected in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.",,,,,Bayesian probability; Official statistics; Inference; Judgement; Tanzania; Bradley–Terry model; Urbanization; Computer science; Developing country; Environmental planning,,,,,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/6544232/the-bayesian-spatial-bradley-terry-model-urban-deprivation-modelling-in-tanzania,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/6544232/the-bayesian-spatial-bradley-terry-model-urban-deprivation-modelling-in-tanzania,,,3208827447,,0,,0,false,,

As the field grows, it is paramount that credibility is maintained in published findings. To date there is no evidence to suggest a lack trust is warranted, however in the midst of the replication crisis there is need to ensure continued rigour. This article presents a z-curve analysis of the replicability of quantitative research in technology education since 1983 using statcheck for automated data extraction. The results indicate that authors often mis-report p-values, typically due to rounding errors, with a small percentage (1.59%) of inconsistently reported p-values leading to decision errors in terms of statistical inference. With respect to replicability, overall it is estimated that 55.7% of reported quantitative results in technology education would replicate, however since 2020 this estimate appears to be increasing. These results do not indicate specific findings which are likely or unlikely to replicate, but do suggest a need to invest effort in identifying studies which would have a high value in being replicated, particularly in the timeframe of work published from 2010 to 2020.",33,4,1243,1264,Replicate; Rigour; Replication (statistics); Credibility; Field (mathematics); Statistical inference; Science education; Data science; Psychology; Statistics; Econometrics; Computer science; Economics; Political science; Mathematics education; Mathematics; Law; Geometry; Pure mathematics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-022-09787-6,,10.1007/s10798-022-09787-6,,,0,003-133-894-756-155; 008-507-283-686-296; 008-547-282-238-391; 010-638-466-986-277; 010-831-747-042-154; 011-670-328-330-938; 014-290-360-592-57X; 015-176-052-280-651; 015-308-872-678-931; 016-307-635-894-536; 016-684-235-186-710; 017-593-822-123-936; 018-605-865-007-224; 018-658-066-225-195; 020-877-708-607-681; 023-442-434-747-228; 023-805-043-914-180; 025-375-416-074-846; 025-790-913-858-99X; 028-560-232-222-30X; 030-197-391-074-111; 032-049-177-406-929; 038-147-029-978-164; 043-021-290-965-890; 043-109-089-826-537; 044-168-167-198-748; 047-028-446-096-95X; 047-911-180-873-821; 056-927-583-024-149; 059-004-435-599-93X; 060-905-981-244-929; 065-101-751-193-458; 067-258-923-634-861; 069-667-630-793-682; 076-937-571-051-048; 081-079-207-961-70X; 096-342-956-887-535; 099-438-879-739-752; 103-161-030-320-18X; 104-100-223-690-643; 107-500-379-449-962; 107-761-336-691-543; 110-157-834-833-687; 113-024-904-983-681; 113-521-072-239-370; 119-258-009-547-381; 122-133-872-698-470; 135-811-922-177-094; 139-313-735-765-898; 149-313-579-896-329; 150-429-807-182-10X; 180-838-506-925-593; 185-138-433-723-804,0,true,,green

This study delves into the critical issue of marking consistency, focusing on speaking proficiency tests in English language learning, which often face greater reliability challenges. While existing literature has explored various methods for assessing marking reliability, this study is the first of its kind to introduce an alternative statistical tool, namely the gauge repeatability and reproducibility (GR&amp;R) approach, to the educational context. The study encompasses both intra- and inter-rater reliabilities, with additional validation using the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC). Using a case study approach involving three examiners evaluating 30 recordings of a speaking proficiency test, the GR&amp;R method demonstrates its effectiveness in detecting reliability issues over the ICC approach. Furthermore, this research identifies key factors influencing scoring inconsistencies, including group performance estimation, work presentation order, rubric complexity and clarity, the student’s chosen topic, accent familiarity, and recording quality. Importantly, it not only pinpoints these root causes but also suggests practical solutions, thereby enhancing the precision of the measurement system. The GR&amp;R method can offer significant contributions to stakeholders in language proficiency assessment, including educational institutions, test developers and policymakers. It is also applicable to other cases of performance-based assessments. By addressing reliability issues, this study provides insights to enhance the fairness and accuracy of subjective judgements, ultimately benefiting overall performance comparisons and decision making.</jats:p>",14,1,,,Reliability (semiconductor); Rubric; CLARITY; Intraclass correlation; Computer science; Context (archaeology); Consistency (knowledge bases); Test (biology); Repeatability; Heuristics; Quality (philosophy); Psychology; Artificial intelligence; Psychometrics; Mathematics education; Statistics; Mathematics; Clinical psychology; Paleontology; Power (physics); Biochemistry; Physics; Chemistry; Epistemology; Philosophy; Quantum mechanics; Biology; Operating system,,,,,https://languagetestingasia.springeropen.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s40468-023-00271-z https://doi.org/10.1186/s40468-023-00271-z,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40468-023-00271-z,,10.1186/s40468-023-00271-z,,,0,001-701-094-745-802; 001-719-523-471-156; 005-770-159-123-540; 008-105-211-247-495; 012-440-381-789-417; 012-466-457-382-046; 015-768-505-095-23X; 017-431-893-830-02X; 021-738-595-719-412; 024-557-202-089-007; 030-551-555-360-480; 032-976-316-336-113; 033-168-508-449-551; 033-254-955-220-960; 036-762-590-085-144; 042-671-614-346-358; 046-027-458-257-078; 047-194-700-536-708; 052-797-187-559-602; 054-994-086-569-110; 066-426-094-524-473; 067-200-117-576-394; 076-209-570-423-641; 077-115-610-080-962; 078-028-807-736-487; 081-398-446-039-956; 103-127-972-697-328; 105-980-076-856-061; 131-490-214-476-923; 133-972-645-991-470; 148-110-287-792-61X; 158-455-334-416-550; 163-552-937-852-234; 176-240-409-711-605,0,true,cc-by,gold

The classical Bradley-Terry model and its variants have been widely used to do so. The historical model considers binary comparisons (victory/defeat) between alternatives, while more recent developments allow finer comparisons to be taken into account. In this article, we introduce a probabilistic model encompassing a broad variety of paired comparisons that can take discrete or continuous values. We do so by considering a well-behaved subset of the exponential family, which we call the family of generalized Bradley-Terry (GBT) models, as it includes the classical Bradley-Terry model and many of its variants. Remarkably, we prove that all GBT models are guaranteed to yield a strictly convex negative log-likelihood. Moreover, assuming a Gaussian prior on alternatives' scores, we prove that the maximum a posteriori (MAP) of GBT models, whose existence, uniqueness and fast computation are thus guaranteed, varies monotonically with respect to comparisons (the more A beats B, the better the score of A) and is Lipschitz-resilient with respect to each new comparison (a single new comparison can only have a bounded effect on all the estimated scores). These desirable properties make GBT models appealing for practical use. We illustrate some features of GBT models on simulations.</jats:p>",38,18,20379,20386,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30020,,10.1609/aaai.v38i18.30020,,,0,,0,false,,
036-468-221-896-18X,A Bayesian Active Learning Approach to Comparative Judgement,2023-08-25,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Andy Gray; Alma Rahat; Tom Crick; Stephen Lindsay,"Assessment is a crucial part of education. Traditional marking is a source of inconsistencies and unconscious bias, placing a high cognitive load on the assessors. An approach to address these issues is comparative judgement (CJ). In CJ, the assessor is presented with a pair of items and is asked to select the better one. Following a series of comparisons, a rank is derived using a ranking model, for example, the BTM, based on the results. While CJ is considered a reliable method for marking, there are concerns around transparency, and the ideal number of pairwise comparisons to generate a reliable estimation of the rank order is not known. Additionally, there have been attempts to generate a method of selecting pairs that should be compared next in an informative manner, but some existing methods are known to have created their own bias within results inflating the reliability metric used. As a result, a random selection approach is usually deployed. We propose a novel Bayesian approach to CJ (BCJ) for determining the ranks of compared items alongside a new way to select the pairs to present to the marker(s) using active learning (AL), addressing the key shortcomings of traditional CJ. Furthermore, we demonstrate how the entire approach may provide transparency by providing the user insights into how it is making its decisions and, at the same time, being more efficient. Results from our experiments confirm that the proposed BCJ combined with entropy-driven AL pair-selection method is superior to other alternatives. We also find that the more comparisons done, the more accurate BCJ becomes, which solves the issue the current method has of the model deteriorating if too many comparisons are performed. As our approach can generate the complete predicted rank distribution for an item, we also show how this can be utilised in devising a predicted grade, guided by the assessor.",,,,,Computer science; Pairwise comparison; Ranking (information retrieval); Transparency (behavior); Judgement; Machine learning; Rank (graph theory); Selection (genetic algorithm); Entropy (arrow of time); Artificial intelligence; Metric (unit); Bayesian probability; Bounding overwatch; Mathematics; Operations management; Physics; Computer security; Combinatorics; Quantum mechanics; Political science; Law; Economics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.13292,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.13292,,10.48550/arxiv.2308.13292,,,0,,0,true,,green

For several countries, a premature ending of the 2019/2020 football season has occurred due to the COVID-19 pandemic. We propose a model-based method as a possible alternative to the use of the incomplete standings to determine the final table. This method measures the performance of the teams in the matches of the season that have been played and predicts the remaining non-played matches through a paired-comparison model. The main advantage of the method compared to the incomplete standings is that it takes account of the bias in the performance measure due to the schedule of the matches in a season. Therefore, the resulting ranking of the teams based on our proposed method can be regarded as more fair in this respect. A forecasting study based on historical data of seven of the main European competitions is used to validate the method.

The effects of FoRs might be the strongest for items using vague quantifier (VQ) scales, which are particularly prominent in quality of life research, compared with numeric responses. This study aims to investigate the impact of FoRs on self-report measures by examining how imposing a specific FoR in survey questions affects (a) the response levels of VQ and numeric scales and (b) the relationship between VQs and a quantitative responses to the same question. A sample of 1869 respondents rated their education, commute and sleep duration, medication use, and level of physical activity using both VQ and numeric formats. Participants were asked to compare themselves with the average US adult, with their friends who are about their age, or did not receive specific instructions regarding a reference for comparison. We found that FoR conditions did not influence the numeric responses. Among the VQ responses, only education attainment was affected by FoR. The association between the numeric responses and vague quantifiers was comparable across different FoR conditions. Our results showed that manipulating the use of interpersonal FoRs had limited effect on the responses, which suggests that at least some comparisons do not have a strong biasing effect on self-report measures. However, future research should confirm this finding for using other FoRs (e.g., historical or hypothetical comparisons) and other outcome measures.",17,1,1,15,Association (psychology); Interpersonal communication; Cognitive psychology; Quality of Life Research; Sleep duration; Outcome measures; Physical activity; Sample (statistics); Frame of reference,Frames of reference; comparison standards; self-report; survey research; vague quantifiers,,,NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG042407) United States,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11482-020-09889-0.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11482-020-09889-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11482-020-09889-0,35330704,10.1007/s11482-020-09889-0,3120477531,PMC8939886,0,000-904-409-011-859; 000-909-576-202-452; 002-506-550-449-437; 005-759-164-025-18X; 008-214-895-427-587; 008-443-620-190-92X; 008-971-053-989-442; 013-449-657-981-58X; 015-972-861-844-071; 016-568-070-980-298; 028-168-419-365-830; 029-647-649-676-92X; 030-011-328-545-365; 037-107-322-568-030; 041-518-725-564-270; 042-636-261-112-498; 043-042-734-594-449; 046-882-809-435-022; 047-081-617-264-704; 048-488-709-387-294; 049-332-843-448-524; 055-132-768-301-821; 055-821-241-795-558; 061-552-598-928-055; 064-286-314-113-584; 078-908-680-304-34X; 080-935-892-796-150; 086-965-215-541-295; 089-952-263-498-179; 090-055-293-037-15X; 090-607-941-740-760; 091-286-722-676-211; 101-449-169-771-321; 112-322-606-605-120; 114-804-728-359-516; 119-378-026-268-41X; 130-319-497-235-794; 153-521-231-756-756; 154-533-654-806-262; 166-390-922-041-076,0,true,,unknown

While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location's forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1)Â forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2)Â the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3)Â two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. We compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that were specifically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a Comparative Judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the visual communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.",,,,,Visualization; Aftershock; Readability; Computer science; Data visualization; Transparency (behavior); Task (project management); Data mining; Engineering; Computer security; Programming language; Civil engineering; Systems engineering,,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/1499/2022/nhess-22-1499-2022.pdf https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac1,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac1,,10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

This is because assessors are asked to compare texts holistically and to make a quality judgment for each text in a pairwise comparison based upon on the most salient and critical differences. Also, the resulted rank order is based on the judgment of all assessors, representing the shared consensus. In order to be able to select the right number of assessors, the question is to what extent the conceptualization of assessors prevails in the aspects they base their judgment on, or whether comparative judgment minimizes the differences between assessors. In other words, can we detect types of assessors who tend to consider certain aspects of text quality more often than others? A total of 64 assessors compared argumentative texts, after which they provided decision statements on what aspects of text quality had informed their judgment. These decision statements were coded on six overarching themes of text quality: argumentation, organization, language use, language conventions, source use, references, and layout. Using a multilevel-latent class analysis, four different types of assessors could be distinguished: narrowly focused, broadly focused, source-focused, and language-focused. However, the analysis also showed that all assessor types mainly focused on argumentation and organization, and that assessor types only partly explained whether the aspect of text quality was mentioned in a decision statement. We conclude that comparative judgment is a strong method for comparing complex constructs like text quality. First, because the rank order combines different views on text quality, but foremost because the method of comparative judgment minimizes differences between assessors.</jats:p>",7,,,,Argumentative; Argumentation theory; Quality (philosophy); Computer science; Conceptualization; Pairwise comparison; Rank (graph theory); Statement (logic); Psychology; Natural language processing; Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Mathematics; Epistemology; Philosophy; Combinatorics,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.823895/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.823895 https://repository.uantwerpen.be/docstore/d:irua:12424 https://hdl.handle.net/10067/1883300151162165141 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/426470/feduc_07_823895.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/426470,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.823895,,10.3389/feduc.2022.823895,,,0,000-768-254-706-053; 006-884-850-875-108; 007-961-401-423-555; 008-515-844-318-494; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-142-973-896-399; 022-967-316-496-62X; 030-544-967-337-273; 033-232-173-220-635; 034-982-523-018-170; 041-210-265-147-079; 043-128-207-906-620; 043-993-488-611-488; 044-803-196-956-309; 048-091-210-665-560; 065-624-677-541-487; 066-908-670-161-319; 071-221-393-839-717; 073-572-324-447-872; 107-790-959-417-375; 115-102-354-884-075; 124-035-717-834-982; 126-454-221-798-016; 148-673-033-661-432,2,true,cc-by,gold

To better understand heterogeneity within a national population, valuation studies may identify latent groups that place different absolute and relative importance (i.e., scale and taste parameters) on the attributes of health profiles.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""OBJECTIVE"" NlmCategory=""OBJECTIVE"">Using discrete choice responses from a Peruvian valuation study, we estimated EQ-5D-5L values on a quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) scale accounting for latent heterogeneity in scale and taste, as well as controlling heteroskedasticity at task level variation.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHOD"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">We conducted a series of latent class analyses, each including the 20 main effects of the EQ-5D-5L and a power function that relaxes the constant proportionality assumption (i.e., discounting) between value and lifespan. Taste class membership was conditional on respondent-specific characteristics and their experience with the composite time trade-off (cTTO) tasks. Scale class membership was conditional on behavioral characteristics such as survey duration and self-stated difficulty level in understanding tasks. Each analysis allowed the scale factor to vary by task type and completion time (i.e., heteroskedasticity).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">The results indicated three taste classes: a quality-of-life oriented class (33.35%) that placed the highest value on levels of severity, a length-of-life oriented class (26.72%) that placed the highest value on lifespan, and a middle class (39.71%) with health attribute effects lower than the quality class and lifespan effect lower than the length-of-life oriented class. The EQ-5D-5L values ranged from - 2.11 to 0.86 (quality-of-life oriented class), from - 0.38 to 1.02 (middle class), and from 0.36 to 1.01 (length-of-life oriented class). The likelihood of being a member of the quality-of-life class was highly dependent on whether the respondent completed the cTTO tasks (p-value &lt; 0.001), which indicated that the cTTO tasks might cause the Peru respondents to inflate the burden of health problems on a QALY scale compared to those who did not complete the cTTO tasks. The results also showed two scale classes as well as heteroskedasticity within each scale class.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Accounting for taste and scale classes simultaneously improveds understanding of preference heterogeneity in health valuation. Future studies may confirm the differences in taste between classes in terms of the effect of quality of life and lifespan attributes. Furthermore, confirmatory evidence is needed on how behavioral variables captured within a study protocol may enhance analyses of preference heterogeneity.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2023.

In applications in which the comparison outcomes are observed as a time series, it is often the case that data are non-stationary, in the sense that the true underlying ranking changes over time. In this paper we are concerned with localizing the change points in a high-dimensional BTL model with piece-wise constant parameters. We propose novel and practicable algorithms based on dynamic programming that can consistently estimate the unknown locations of the change points. We provide consistency rates for our methodology that depend explicitly on the model parameters, the temporal spacing between two consecutive change points and the magnitude of the change.

We consider the widely adopted Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, where each item is assigned a positive preference score that determines the Bernoulli distributions of pairwise comparisons' outcomes. Our proposed method aims to infer general ranking properties of the BTL model. The general ranking properties include the ""local"" properties such as if an item is preferred over another and the ""global"" properties such as if an item is among the top $K$-ranked items. We further generalize our inferential framework to multiple testing problems where we control the false discovery rate (FDR), and apply the method to infer the top-$K$ ranked items. We also derive the information-theoretic lower bound to justify the minimax optimality of the proposed method.

It is a question, using the stylistic approach, of showing the role that this discourse plays in a literary text. Indeed, writers such as Chinua Achebe, Seydou Badian, Amadou Hampaté Bâ, Ahmadou Kourouma, Sembene Ousmane, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o and Henri Lopes employ proverbial discourse with metaphorical, comparative, judgmental, ethical and satirical effects not only to embellish romantic stories by their figurative and pictorial meaning, but also and above all to ensure a playful and didactic function in the training of individuals. The insertion of this discourse in the literary text reflects the influence of civilization, better of orality in Negro-African literature. Thus, its use appears as a sign of maturity or culture.

In contrast, comparative judgement studies suggest that it is possible to assess open ended tasks such as writing with greater reliability. Many previous studies, however, have failed to provide direct comparisons between these approaches as the reliability measures for rubric- and marking-based studies are not comparable with the internal measures of reliability cited by comparative judgement studies. We investigated the classification accuracy and consistency of a rubric-based approach to the grading of writing with a comparative judgement approach. The writing was gathered from 11-year-olds in low stakes settings in England. We present evidence that the comparative judgement approach has twice the classification accuracy of the rubric-based approach and is perfectly viable in terms of its efficiency.

For consecutive pairs of student works (representations) assessors are asked to judge which representation is better. It has been shown that random construction of pairs leads to very inefficient assessments, requiring a lot of pairwise comparisons to reach reliable results. Some adaptive selection algorithms using information from previous comparisons were proposed to increase the efficiency of CJ. These adaptive algorithms appear however to artificially inflate the reliability of CJ results through increasing the spread of the results. The current article proposes a new adaptive selection algorithm using a previously calibrated reference set. Using a reference set should eliminate the reliability inflation. In a real assessment, using reference sets of different reliability, and in a simulation study, it is proven that this adaptive selection algorithm is more efficient without reducing the accuracy of the results and without increasing the standard deviation of the assessment results. As a consequence, a reference-based adaptive selection algorithm produces high and correct reliability values in an efficient manner.</jats:p>",6,,,,Reliability (semiconductor); Selection (genetic algorithm); Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Algorithm; Representation (politics); Data mining; Adaptive algorithm; Selection algorithm; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Power (physics); Physics; Quantum mechanics; Politics; Political science; Law; Programming language,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.785919/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.785919 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/417696/feduc_06_785919.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/417696 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/419021/feduc_06_785919.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/419021,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.785919,,10.3389/feduc.2021.785919,,,0,007-840-977-956-003; 015-035-210-409-280; 017-738-075-028-728; 017-978-648-254-97X; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-083-999-137-190; 021-738-595-719-412; 022-886-709-886-069; 027-469-780-443-206; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-966-099-589-64X; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 073-572-324-447-872; 073-721-820-800-758; 077-080-474-170-543; 088-025-186-680-589; 123-212-204-814-685; 143-327-887-855-405; 148-673-033-661-432,1,true,cc-by,gold

But it should not be described as an argument-free zone, regardless of whether this is intended as a descriptive claim about the work of the “usual suspects” or a normative claim about how phenomenology ought to be properly practiced. If phenomenology is always at least partly in the business of arguments, then it is worth giving further attention to the role and form of phenomenological argumentation, how it interacts with its more strictly descriptive component, and the status of phenomenological claims regarding conditions for various kinds of experience. I contend that different versions of phenomenological reasoning encroach upon argument forms that are commonly thought to be antithetical to phenomenology, notably abductive reasoning, understood in terms of its role in both hypothesis generation <jats:italic>and</jats:italic> in terms of justification. This paper identifies two main steps to making this case. The first step takes seriously the consequences of the intrinsically dialectical aspect of phenomenology in intersection with other modes of philosophy, the natural attitude, and non-philosophy. The second step focuses on transcendental reflection and arguments about the conditions/structures they contain. Together, these two steps aim to rescue phenomenology from the objection that it has an “ostrich epistemology” with regard to the ostensible purity of description, the intuition of essences, or the “conditions” ascertained through transcendental reflection.</jats:p>",22,3,557,574,Phenomenology (philosophy); Epistemology; Transcendental number; Dialectic; Philosophy; Philosophy of mind; Presupposition; Psychology; Metaphysics,,,,Deakin University,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11097-022-09834-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11097-022-09834-6 https://philpapers.org/archive/REYPAA-3.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/REYPAA-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11097-022-09834-6,,10.1007/s11097-022-09834-6,,,0,006-628-015-990-644; 008-703-072-560-624; 012-479-716-167-010; 017-186-386-944-536; 019-148-398-677-557; 038-297-932-426-829; 038-642-172-348-163; 053-901-383-426-413; 060-652-723-639-394; 065-978-776-684-203; 068-861-998-748-209; 069-053-141-137-346; 070-098-787-102-227; 086-232-604-119-137; 120-472-832-660-72X; 122-042-837-331-100; 124-512-783-782-227; 131-984-720-546-234; 142-973-238-135-424; 151-576-387-992-320; 152-988-433-227-556; 170-444-189-968-981; 174-469-147-957-690,3,true,cc-by,hybrid
045-271-979-510-575,Using Elo Rating as a Metric for Comparative Judgement in Educational Assessment,2022-07-13,2022,conference proceedings article,Proceedings of the 6th International Conference on Education and Multimedia Technology,,ACM,,Andy Gray; Alma A.M Rahat; Tom Crick; Stephen Lindsay; Darren Wallace,"Marking and feedback are essential features of teaching and learning, across the overwhelming majority of educational settings and contexts. However, it can take a great deal of time and effort for teachers to mark assessments, and to provide useful feedback to the students. Furthermore, it also creates a significant cognitive load on the assessors, especially in ensuring fairness and equity. Therefore, an alternative approach to marking called comparative judgement (CJ) has been proposed in the educational space. Inspired by the law of comparative judgment (LCJ). The key idea here is that the better submission between a pair will be identified by a suitably qualified or experienced assessor. This pairwise comparison for as many pairs as possible can then be used to rank all submissions. Studies suggest that CJ is highly reliable and accurate while making it quick for the teachers. Alternative studies have questioned this claim suggesting that the process can increase bias in the results as the same submission is shown many times to an assessor for increasing reliability. Additionally, studies have also found that CJ can result in the overall marking process taking longer than a more traditional method of marking as information about many pairs must be collected.",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Judgement; Computer science; Metric (unit); Rank (graph theory); Process (computing); Reliability (semiconductor); Key (lock); Artificial intelligence; Information retrieval; Mathematics education; Psychology; Mathematics; Law; Political science; Power (physics); Physics; Computer security; Combinatorics; Quantum mechanics; Economics; Operating system; Operations management,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2204.01805 https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01805,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3551708.3556204,,10.1145/3551708.3556204,,,0,028-924-612-676-914; 030-288-381-457-294; 039-317-398-307-468; 040-241-846-826-833; 070-190-701-485-020; 089-058-724-561-374; 102-955-514-174-383; 106-203-000-628-767; 113-675-521-837-491; 133-972-645-991-470; 144-470-591-189-747; 158-889-520-112-161,2,true,,green

International Journal of Research and Practice in Interpreting,13846647; 1569982x,John Benjamins Publishing Company,Netherlands,Chao Han,"Abstract In this study, we applied and evaluated a scoring method known as comparative judgement to assess spoken-language interpreting. This methodological exploration represents an extension of previous efforts to optimise scoring methods for assessing interpreting. Essentially, comparative judgement requires judges to compare two similar objects and make a binary decision about their relative qualities. To evaluate its reliability, validity and usefulness in the assessment of interpreting, we recruited two groups of judges (novice and experienced) to assess 66 two-way English/Chinese interpretations based on a computerised comparative judgement system. Our data analysis shows that the new method produced reliable and valid results across judge types and interpreting directions. However, the judges held polarised opinions about the method’s usefulness: while some considered it convenient, efficient and reliable, the opposite view was expressed by others. We discuss the results by providing an integrated analysis of the data collected, outline the perceived drawbacks and propose possible solutions to the drawbacks. We call for more evidence-based, substantive investigation into comparative judgement as a potentially useful method for assessing spoken-language interpreting in certain settings.",24,1,59,83,Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Spoken language; Judgement; Extension (predicate logic); Scoring methods; Binary decision diagram; Computer science; Reliability (statistics),,,,,https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/intp.00068.han,http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/intp.00068.han,,10.1075/intp.00068.han,3201969790,,0,000-233-371-514-199; 003-246-101-015-762; 003-422-625-053-401; 006-719-044-652-648; 008-928-694-487-22X; 009-316-589-031-043; 014-530-755-401-82X; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 022-445-591-735-121; 028-600-184-401-058; 031-008-341-630-352; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-444-997-041-097; 038-655-778-187-133; 041-339-979-794-70X; 047-311-059-171-749; 048-091-210-665-560; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 089-185-984-021-042; 098-395-798-963-521; 098-540-504-765-852; 098-611-978-567-247; 102-013-168-944-496; 102-955-514-174-383; 106-532-502-155-602; 125-412-474-930-044; 144-069-365-424-760; 145-591-602-199-471; 148-673-033-661-432; 154-607-497-702-185; 170-718-202-111-866; 173-293-063-566-147; 173-470-981-138-04X; 184-221-392-909-039,1,false,,

Previous attempts to explain these better-than-average and worse-than-average effects have invoked bias and motivation as causes.  This paper develops a more parsimonious account, the differential information explanation, which assumes only that people typically have better information about themselves than they do about others.  When one’s own performance is exceptional (either good or bad), it is often reasonable to assume others’ will be less so.  Consequently, people estimate the performance of others as less extreme (more regressive) than their own.  The result is that people believe they are above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult tasks.  These effects are exacerbated when people have accurate information about their performances, increasing the natural discrepancy between knowledge of self and others.  The effects are attenuated when people obtain accurate information about the performances of others.</p>",,,,,Psychology; Natural (archaeology); Cognitive psychology; Differential (mechanical device); Social psychology; Computer science; Archaeology; Engineering; History; Aerospace engineering,,,,,https://osf.io/xqgp3/download https://osf.io/xqgp3/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xqgp3,,10.31234/osf.io/xqgp3,,,0,,0,true,,green

Inspired by the multiple stimulus test with hidden reference and anchors (MUSHRA) from the audio domain, we designed a method in which each compressed signal is compared to its original signal and rated on a numerical scale. For each signal tested, the hidden reference and two anchor signals are used to validate the results and provide assessor screening criteria. Differing from previous approaches, our method is hierarchically structured and strictly timed in a sequential manner to avoid experimental confounds and provide precise psychophysical assessments. We validated our method in an experiment with 20 human participants in which we compared two state-of-the-art lossy codecs.

It is hypothesized that each individual's tolerance for background noise on one hand and signal distortions on the other hand form this preference. We aim to visualize and analyze this so-called trade-off between noise attenuation and signal quality. Dutch sentences in stationary background noise were processed with different NR strengths. We used an NR algorithm that allows us to separate the positive effects of NR (noise attenuation) from the negative effects (signal distortion). Stimuli consisted of speech in noise with different degrees of (1) background noise, (2) signal distortions, or (3) both (i.e., realistic NR at different NR strengths). With pairwise comparisons, participants chose which stimulus they preferred for prolonged listening. Twelve listeners with mild to moderate hearing loss participated in the study. For all participants, a trade-off between noise attenuation and signal quality was found and visualized. The strength of preference was estimated with the Bradley-Terry-Luce choice model and was different for all individuals but in the same order of magnitude for distortion effects and noise effects. Strength of preference of realistic NR was smaller by a factor of ten. This study used a unique setup to capture the individual trade-off between noise attenuation and signal quality in NR. Disturbance from signal distortions is as important as disturbance from background noise for determining preference for NR strength. Individual listeners differ in their sensitivity to both factors and as a consequence in their preferred NR strength.",27,,23312165231192304,,Noise (video); Attenuation; Speech recognition; Noise reduction; Background noise; Distortion (music); Psychology; Acoustics; SIGNAL (programming language); Active listening; Audiology; Computer science; Mathematics; Statistics; Communication; Telecommunications; Physics; Artificial intelligence; Medicine; Bandwidth (computing); Optics; Amplifier; Image (mathematics); Programming language,auditory perception; hearing aids; hearing loss; paired comparisons,"Humans; Hearing Loss, Sensorineural; Hearing Aids; Speech Perception; Noise/adverse effects; Hearing Loss",,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/23312165231192304 https://doi.org/10.1177/23312165231192304,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/23312165231192304,37525630,10.1177/23312165231192304,,PMC10395179,0,001-125-568-344-873; 004-945-458-391-399; 008-961-980-157-728; 009-974-379-851-208; 011-118-713-095-912; 013-762-912-222-443; 014-880-479-816-796; 015-676-265-852-538; 024-457-823-062-570; 028-678-679-376-86X; 028-787-319-883-529; 038-446-458-608-970; 042-882-543-721-578; 044-335-259-419-953; 045-968-394-013-290; 052-693-627-974-791; 055-844-053-782-655; 057-043-858-524-576; 057-491-661-038-354; 058-362-403-308-898; 064-421-113-122-90X; 065-730-550-781-466; 068-125-962-848-157; 068-983-634-690-400; 070-763-145-240-940; 080-047-888-621-862; 095-851-214-419-061; 097-377-191-713-387; 097-819-506-519-745; 099-762-849-271-583; 112-053-151-854-83X; 117-341-991-234-105; 118-123-227-066-32X; 139-300-693-050-09X,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

This paper presents a RRDD model for network security risk assessment of ICS, which consists of four parts: Risk identification (R), Risk calculation (R), Defense strategy (D), and Defense measures (D). Risk identification is based on the ICS ATT&CK to analyze the network security risk assessment indicators of the ICS, to clarify the vulnerability of the industrial control system, the importance of assets, the threats faced and the existing mitigation measures. Risk calculation is based on the analysis results of risk assessment indicators, establishing a comparative judgment matrix to analyze the relative importance of each indicator, calculating the weight of each indicator, and calculating and grading the overall risk of ICS. Furthermore, the model adopts corresponding safety control strategies and measures based on the risk calculation results, and conducts closed-loop risk assessment and elimination. It can effectively evaluate and disposal the network security risks in ICS.",,,,,Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Vulnerability (computing); Security controls; Identification (biology); Computer science; Industrial control system; Control (management); Grading (engineering); Risk management; Network security; Computer security; Engineering; Business; Botany; Civil engineering; Finance; Artificial intelligence; Biology,,,,National Key R&D Plan of China,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3605801.3605837,,10.1145/3605801.3605837,,,0,008-105-355-172-998; 008-361-182-205-773; 028-043-018-643-845; 032-003-381-393-13X; 039-432-956-654-055; 049-145-628-018-042; 103-671-734-425-692; 127-391-836-848-383; 183-988-546-902-217,0,false,,

One construct that has proven useful for the identification and realization of language functions in disciplinary knowledge is Dalton-Puffer’s (2013) model of cognitive discourse functions (CDFs). Additionally, Systemic Functional Linguistics (SFL) has already been proven useful for distinguishing lexico-grammatical features that characterise different CDFs in CLIL students’ productions (e.g., Nashaat-Sobhy & Llinares, 2020; Evnitskaya & Dalton-Puffer, 2020). In this article, we use SFL to analyse the oral and written realisations of the CDF Define by 6th grade students participating in a CLIL program in Madrid, Spain. A total of 83 students responded to the same prompt (on science) in writing (in the form of a blog) as well as orally (in the form of an interview). In the oral interviews the co-construction of definitions by the students with the interviewer (researcher) and another peer are explored using the notion of Legitimation Code Theory and the concept of semantic waves (Maton, 2013). The analysis of students’ definitions is also related to primary CLIL teachers’ evaluations using comparative judgement.",3,2,337,362,Foreign language; Mathematics education; Psychology; Cognition; Construct (philosophy); Interview; Judgement; Content and language integrated learning; Systemic functional linguistics; Discipline,,,,,https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/ltyl.20010.lli,http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/ltyl.20010.lli,,10.1075/ltyl.20010.lli,3185335004,,0,000-613-708-592-454; 006-200-698-510-242; 006-292-533-369-990; 014-045-670-192-679; 016-119-200-150-361; 016-834-040-590-781; 017-471-622-285-476; 022-445-591-735-121; 028-284-593-955-412; 029-760-593-482-695; 036-413-083-907-507; 037-845-428-607-426; 038-641-070-978-565; 040-379-237-763-218; 048-091-210-665-560; 049-450-413-847-434; 053-881-960-942-261; 056-413-040-692-345; 058-634-117-594-922; 072-947-343-131-525; 091-761-884-832-74X; 096-092-251-511-280; 107-390-229-971-232; 110-982-600-684-455; 111-190-812-797-858; 115-390-953-213-328; 115-889-574-457-034; 124-099-613-158-599; 133-923-690-551-473; 140-240-673-380-888; 143-706-049-161-21X; 145-907-333-853-575; 177-588-426-540-688; 188-359-321-000-474; 193-195-409-828-156,5,false,,

Müller; V. Busse,"<jats:title>Zusammenfassung</jats:title><jats:p>Während die empirische Bildungsforschung literale Kompetenzen wie Lesen und Orthographie an weiterführenden Schulen recht umfassend in den Blick nimmt, gibt es vergleichsweise wenige Studien, die Texttiefenmerkmale untersuchen. Unser Beitrag analysiert instruktionale und argumentative Texte einer Stichprobe von Lernenden (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 208) in Jahrgang 9 an nichtgymnasialen Schulformen und nimmt dabei differentielle Analysen nach Migrationshintergrund und Familiensprachen vor. Texttiefenmerkmale werden dabei mittels eines analytischen Diagnoseinstruments ausgewertet, das nach Struktur und Kohärenz unterscheidet. Ergänzend wird die Textqualität durch einen holistischen Vergleich der Texte (<jats:italic>Comparative Judgement </jats:italic>mit der Software<jats:italic> Comproved</jats:italic>®) bestimmt, zudem wurde die Textlänge erfasst. Hohe Korrelationen zwischen der analytischen Auswertung, dem holistischen Rating und der Textlänge bei insgesamt 415 Texten weisen darauf hin, dass Struktur und Kohärenz wichtige Aspekte der Textqualität sind. Die analytische Auswertung offenbart, dass im Bereich der Struktur fast alle Lernenden und im Bereich der Kohärenz etwa ein Drittel der Lernenden weniger als die Hälfte des theoretischen Maximums erreichen.

However, compulsory attraction to emotions gets challenging when multiple emotional stimuli compete for attention, as in the emotion comparison task. In this task, participants are asked to choose which of two simultaneously presented faces displays the most positive (happiest) or negative (angriest) emotion. Participants usually respond faster to the face displaying the most intense emotion. This effect is stronger for face pairs that contain globally positive rather than negative emotional faces. Both effects are consistent with an attentional capture phenomenon driven by the perceptual salience of facial expressions. In the present experiment, we studied the temporal dynamics of attentional capture in the emotion comparison task by tracking participants' eye movements using gaze-contingent displays and responses. Our results show that, on the first fixation, participants were more accurate and dwelled longer on the left target face when it displayed the most intense emotion within the pair. On the second fixation, the pattern was reversed, with higher accuracy and longer gaze time on the right target face. Overall, our pattern of gazing behavior indicates that the typical results observed in the emotion comparison task arise from the optimal combination over time of two low-level attentional factors: the perceptual salience of emotional stimuli and the scanning habit of participants.",13,1,7324,,Salience (neuroscience); Gaze; Psychology; Fixation (population genetics); Perception; Cognitive psychology; Facial expression; Attentional bias; Emotion perception; Dynamics (music); Task (project management); Negative emotion; Eye movement; Developmental psychology; Cognition; Communication; Neuroscience; Medicine; Population; Pedagogy; Environmental health; Management; Psychoanalysis; Economics,,Humans; Emotions/physiology; Eye Movements; Anger; Happiness; Facial Expression,,Regione Autonoma Friuli Venezia Giulia; Università degli Studi di Trieste,https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-33711-0.pdf https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33711-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-023-33711-0,37147340,10.1038/s41598-023-33711-0,,PMC10163009,0,001-736-503-518-484; 002-244-821-401-703; 003-086-472-590-707; 004-731-567-191-050; 005-196-318-806-813; 005-664-757-831-02X; 006-120-214-930-292; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-926-410-139-923; 008-192-712-366-191; 008-323-657-407-735; 009-638-275-134-279; 010-516-837-201-577; 014-347-760-732-628; 015-154-358-430-029; 016-212-380-165-689; 017-379-882-949-118; 018-197-156-329-87X; 018-309-790-268-596; 018-781-528-222-92X; 018-874-253-096-997; 018-921-677-055-610; 022-396-094-696-709; 023-754-041-229-000; 025-498-067-077-896; 025-971-418-331-624; 028-408-096-836-385; 028-411-442-652-325; 028-421-417-276-988; 029-165-433-720-117; 032-049-177-406-929; 032-244-775-654-870; 035-211-639-161-455; 035-522-074-408-50X; 047-210-042-247-724; 047-865-691-960-631; 049-092-015-677-954; 049-101-291-611-208; 049-863-149-640-914; 051-066-076-538-547; 054-410-485-160-492; 054-962-370-001-817; 057-183-336-446-253; 058-527-680-459-072; 066-608-905-207-154; 070-938-631-328-683; 073-811-902-344-708; 076-581-189-154-711; 082-479-245-913-353; 084-331-650-963-284; 087-300-622-382-439; 088-046-440-608-770; 090-473-073-536-194; 090-767-893-055-701; 094-606-619-288-201; 099-393-670-020-302; 102-913-201-700-172; 105-942-707-129-817; 106-197-189-659-701; 112-121-981-902-302; 113-558-791-665-922; 114-992-167-812-755; 118-531-830-057-973; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 133-258-875-922-050; 134-258-973-301-932; 149-229-185-800-505; 152-097-417-392-94X,0,true,cc-by,gold

Yet, conventional approaches for investigating comparability in multilingual assessments fail to accommodate assessments that comprise extended responses that target complex constructs. This article discusses a study that investigated whether bilingual examiners could apply comparative judgment (CJ) to pairs of Literature essays across different languages (English and Spanish). Preliminary findings suggest that whilst there are some cross-language standardization benefits, bilingual CJ faces validity challenges when different language cohorts approach target constructs differently. Existing definitions of inter-subject and intra-subject comparability are insufficient when multilingual subjects share fundamental constructs but differ in academic approaches. It is therefore proposed that an overarching classification of intra-­disciplinary comparability be introduced to frame discussions around multilingual assessments of this nature. Finally, it is recommended that further research into bilingual CJ be carried out to determine how the method can most effectively support investigations into multilingual assessment comparability.",23,2,111,134,Comparability; Summative assessment; Context (archaeology); Standardization; Psychology; Computer science; Linguistics; Mathematics education; Formative assessment; Mathematics; Geography; Philosophy; Archaeology; Combinatorics; Operating system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15305058.2022.2149536,,10.1080/15305058.2022.2149536,,,0,018-484-089-487-983; 022-447-205-256-181; 039-401-557-628-181; 047-220-926-199-739; 048-091-210-665-560; 055-858-162-703-52X; 058-154-560-942-765; 058-991-873-265-740; 066-622-118-342-358; 105-074-544-028-132; 115-256-283-234-383; 126-454-221-798-016; 135-248-662-732-96X; 148-673-033-661-432,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

It is proved that they provide the same priority vectors for consistent (complete or incomplete) comparisons. For incomplete comparisons, all filling in levels are considered. Recent results identified the optimal subsets and sequences of multiplicative/additive/reciprocal pairwise comparisons for small sizes of items (up to n=6). Simulations of this paper show that the same subsets and sequences are optimal in the case of the Bradley–Terry and the Thurstone models as well.

Given this, it is natural to ask what makes a good mathematical explanation. This question has received surprisingly little attention in the mathematics education literature, perhaps because the field has no agreed method by which explanation quality can be reliably assessed. In this paper, we explore this issue by asking whether mathematicians and undergraduates agree with each other about explanation quality. A corpus of 10 explanations produced by 10 mathematicians was used. Using a comparative judgement method, we analysed 320 paired comparisons from 16 mathematicians and 320 from 32 undergraduate students. We found that both mathematicians and undergraduates were able to reliably assess the quality of a set of mathematical explanations. Furthermore, the assessments were largely consistent across the two groups. Implications for theories of mathematical explanation are discussed. We conclude by arguing that comparative judgement is a promising technique for exploring explanation quality.</jats:p>",111,3,445,467,Judgement; Mathematics education; Quality (philosophy); Set (abstract data type); Field (mathematics); Psychology; Natural (archaeology); Epistemology; Mathematics; Computer science; Philosophy; Pure mathematics; Programming language; Archaeology; History,,,,"Faculty of Science, University of Auckland; University of Auckland",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10649-022-10164-2.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10649-022-10164-2 https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Do_mathematicians_and_undergraduates_agree_about_explanation_quality_/22117079/1/files/39303419.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Do_mathematicians_and_undergraduates_agree_about_explanation_quality_/22117079,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-022-10164-2,,10.1007/s10649-022-10164-2,,,0,005-165-419-758-732; 005-293-935-125-874; 008-465-128-089-915; 009-847-062-348-944; 010-692-892-770-10X; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-799-016-187-820; 018-882-339-673-062; 022-291-764-381-589; 022-330-043-950-410; 025-440-331-318-563; 026-827-360-910-454; 026-835-039-153-717; 029-358-888-761-776; 033-203-671-635-021; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-408-540-095-940; 037-219-397-330-808; 039-110-989-706-198; 039-535-495-954-11X; 040-241-846-826-833; 046-154-535-777-571; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-410-970-333-976; 063-050-173-869-531; 064-531-246-677-746; 065-017-059-818-704; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 068-782-354-077-280; 075-171-387-772-993; 075-286-950-578-63X; 076-239-543-304-767; 077-169-031-162-377; 079-204-990-553-617; 080-467-844-331-434; 091-666-780-893-50X; 092-389-848-969-819; 095-796-225-466-809; 095-817-934-642-262; 096-950-253-141-226; 106-977-955-635-387; 110-668-571-614-312; 113-560-068-573-95X; 113-625-610-351-324; 114-965-332-961-073; 119-550-971-205-730; 122-448-167-938-324; 128-903-523-677-504; 139-181-289-960-359; 140-518-757-041-182; 146-526-950-533-937; 150-149-980-123-684; 160-805-237-718-329; 177-072-688-486-223; 182-272-792-778-186,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

Kugelberg,"A common objection to political liberalism is that since reasonable citizens agree that some ways of life are worse than others – for instance that the life of a drug addict is less worthwhile than the life of a person who spends her time with family and philosophy – political liberals must concede that the state can sometimes permissibly use perfectionist reasons. I argue in this paper that this challenge is mistaken, because the comparison only tells us something about relative, not absolute, value. And because the real question concerns what the right justificatory constituency looks like, not what counts as reasonable in some other sense, the implication is that perfectionists and political liberals could construct equally plausible idealised constituencies. This stalemate gives us reason to develop arguments in favour of our preferred justificatory constituency.

In some cases, it may be reasonable to assume that the preferences expressed by individuals depend on their characteristics. Within the framework of tree-based partitioning, we specify a tree-based model estimating the joint effects of subject-specific covariates over and above their main effects. We, therefore, combine a tree-based model and the log-linear Bradley-Terry model using the outcome of the comparisons as response variable. The proposed model provides a solution to discover interaction effects when no a-priori hypotheses are available. It produces a small tree, called trunk, that represents a fair compromise between a simple interpretation of the interaction effects and an easy to read partition of judges based on their characteristics and the preferences they have expressed. We present an application on a real dataset following two different approaches, and a simulation study to test the model's performance. Simulations showed that the quality of the model performance increases when the number of rankings and objects increases. In addition, the performance is considerably amplified when the judges' characteristics have a high impact on their choices.",88,4,1443,1465,Covariate; Preference; Tree (set theory); Computer science; A priori and a posteriori; Statistics; Regression analysis; Regression; Artificial intelligence; Econometrics; Outcome (game theory); Machine learning; Interpretation (philosophy); Probabilistic logic; Mathematics; Mathematical economics; Mathematical analysis; Philosophy; Epistemology; Programming language,GLM; STIMA; paired comparisons; preference rankings; regression tree,Humans; Psychometrics; Computer Simulation; Linear Models,,Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11336-022-09882-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-022-09882-6 https://scholarlypublications.universiteitleiden.nl/access/item%3A3515565/view https://hdl.handle.net/1887/3515564,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-022-09882-6,36057077,10.1007/s11336-022-09882-6,,PMC10656329,0,000-285-613-706-834; 001-185-389-772-551; 013-259-330-177-939; 016-173-243-000-192; 016-540-968-278-556; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-659-732-285-802; 022-330-469-474-714; 027-593-817-422-539; 029-712-119-607-36X; 030-527-063-809-042; 033-069-438-793-58X; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-656-251-943-572; 044-335-259-419-953; 044-543-500-382-496; 048-597-194-899-33X; 053-503-090-320-486; 057-226-726-733-714; 062-599-713-102-887; 063-102-431-615-369; 072-250-786-705-874; 080-954-202-525-809; 082-439-348-646-693; 085-576-748-747-709; 085-685-156-527-975; 087-614-077-558-532; 096-986-753-492-254; 107-965-872-419-29X; 108-784-569-028-003; 112-507-928-838-921; 120-678-899-167-781; 122-376-674-983-517; 128-953-148-962-818; 131-849-935-365-092; 139-200-896-129-808; 141-224-504-097-789; 183-914-972-982-465; 189-168-054-812-367,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

A key consideration is the validity of expert judgements. This article details a study where an aspect of validity, whether or not judges are attending to construct-irrelevant features, was investigated. There are a number of potentially construct-irrelevant features indicated in the assessment literature, and we focused on four features: appearance; handwriting; spelling, punctuation, and grammar (SPaG); and missing response vs. incorrect answer. This study explored this through an empirical experiment supplemented by judge observation and survey. The study was conducted within an awarding organisation. The particular context was within a programme of work trialling, a new method of maintaining examination standards involving the comparative judgement of candidates’ examination responses from the same subject from two different years. Judgements in this context are cognitively demanding, and there is a possibility that judges may attend to superficial features of the responses they are comparing. It is, therefore, important to understand how CJ decisions are made and what they are or are not based on so that we can have confidence in judgements and know that any use of them is valid.</jats:p>",7,,,,Judgement; Construct (python library); Psychology; Context (archaeology); Punctuation; Handwriting; Construct validity; Spelling; Cognitive psychology; Grammar; Social psychology; Applied psychology; Computer science; Linguistics; Artificial intelligence; Psychometrics; Epistemology; Developmental psychology; Paleontology; Philosophy; Biology; Programming language,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.802392/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.802392 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/1810/337037/feduc-07-802392.pdf?sequence=4&isAllowed=y https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/337037,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.802392,,10.3389/feduc.2022.802392,,,0,008-515-844-318-494; 013-504-862-552-281; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-648-340-080-685; 025-677-136-905-020; 037-416-173-942-082; 044-803-196-956-309; 048-091-210-665-560; 068-556-006-669-444; 087-991-691-200-809; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-790-959-417-375; 119-207-516-385-997; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-632-501-705-270; 132-088-400-403-42X; 148-673-033-661-432; 160-805-237-718-329; 163-379-589-157-078,2,true,cc-by,gold

Peter Hong; Wen-Yang Chen; Hao-Tang Chang,"This work proposes SpecRank, an algorithm for the ranking of objects from pairwise comparisons provided by workers with different specialties in a crowdsourced setting. We assume that the objects may belong to different latent classes that are unknown to the requester, and the workers' ability to provide reliable labels may depend on their specialty or familiarity with these classes. We first propose a specialty Bradley-Terry-Luce (specialty-BTL) model that incorporates workers' specialties in the quality of their pairwise comparison labels. Moreover, we adopt a latent feature model where the scores of objects are modeled as inner products between the latent feature vectors of the objects and their associated classes. The workers' ability to provide accurate pairwise labels is also determined by the correlation between their specialty feature vectors and the class feature vectors. By adopting a mixture model on the objects' class labels, our proposed SpecRank adopts variational expectation maximization (EM) algorithm to perform joint ranking and clustering of the objects. The effectiveness of the proposed specialty-BTL model and the SpecRank algorithm is demonstrated on both synthetic and real-world datasets.",,,1,6,Feature model; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Expectation–maximization algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Class (computer programming); Computer science; Mixture model; Cluster analysis; Feature vector,,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/mlsp/mlsp2021.html#HongCC21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/mlsp52302.2021.9596411,,10.1109/mlsp52302.2021.9596411,3214226124,,0,004-828-689-230-442; 005-592-077-144-998; 010-132-302-334-522; 027-669-405-046-467; 031-682-568-980-503; 047-307-839-107-965; 055-284-632-827-86X; 056-316-939-709-905; 073-130-603-418-152; 075-474-139-111-22X; 087-991-691-200-809; 110-916-347-537-21X; 112-428-364-063-351; 141-412-401-328-220; 150-232-582-758-104; 173-444-467-579-628,0,false,,

Significantly, holistic assessment presents an agility and collective approach to establishing in the minds of teachers “what is of value” when determining the comparative evidence of pupil performance. It is argued in this paper that the collation of the comparative judgment process can initially identify and subsequently maintain standards of performance that can be defined on a cluster, regional or even national level. Much comparative judgment research centers on the formative benefits for learners, but here we place the focus on teachers operating in collaborative groups to establish standards within and beyond their own schools, and ultimately across the nation. We model a proof-of-concept research project. A rank is produced by the collective consensus of the participating teachers and used to simulate a definition of standard. Extrapolations are statistically modeled to demonstrate the potential for this approach to establishing a robust definition of national standards. But central to the process is what is going on in the minds of teachers as they make their judgements of quality. The research aims to draw out teachers’ constructs of quality; to make them explicit; to share them across classrooms and schools; and to empower teachers to debate and agree their standards across schools. This research brings to the fore the symbiotic relationship between teaching, learning and assessment.</jats:p>",7,,,,Formative assessment; Process (computing); Quality (philosophy); Mathematics education; Value (mathematics); Rank (graph theory); Collation; Psychology; Pedagogy; Public relations; Political science; Computer science; Mathematics; Philosophy; Operating system; Epistemology; Combinatorics; Machine learning,,,,Athlone Institute of Technology,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.806894/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.806894 https://research.gold.ac.uk/id/eprint/31728/1/feduc-07-806894.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.806894,,10.3389/feduc.2022.806894,,,0,008-515-844-318-494; 014-290-360-592-57X; 016-279-152-792-986; 022-886-709-886-069; 027-469-780-443-206; 035-966-099-589-64X; 048-091-210-665-560; 055-671-696-900-616; 066-908-670-161-319; 101-443-312-067-701; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-096-746-639-636; 107-790-959-417-375; 126-454-221-798-016; 148-673-033-661-432; 149-208-961-050-864; 161-390-094-420-983; 168-704-895-296-891; 177-072-688-486-223,1,true,cc-by,gold

Their popularity undermines the healthiness of traditional food recommender systems, as many users lack nutritional knowledge to make informed food decisions. Moreover, the presented information is often unrelated to nutrition or difficult to understand. To alleviate this, we present a methodology to generate natural language justifications that emphasize the nutritional content, health risks, or benefits of recommended recipes. Our framework takes a user and two recipes as input and produces an automatically generated natural language justification as output, based on the user’s characteristics and the recipes’ features, following a knowledge-based recommendation approach. We evaluated our methodology in two crowdsourcing studies. In Study 1 (<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$N=502$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">;                 <mml:mrow>;                   <mml:mi>N</mml:mi>;                   <mml:mo>=</mml:mo>;                   <mml:mn>502</mml:mn>;                 </mml:mrow>;               </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>), we compared user food choices for two personalized recommendation approaches, based on either a (1) single-style justification or (2) comparative justification was shown, using a no justification baseline. The recommendations were either popularity-based or health-aware, the latter based on the health and nutritional needs of the user. We found that comparative justification styles were effective in supporting choices for our health-aware recommendations, confirming the impact of our methodology on food choices. In Study 2 (<jats:inline-formula><jats:alternatives><jats:tex-math>$$N=504$$</jats:tex-math><mml:math xmlns:mml=""http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML"">;                 <mml:mrow>;                   <mml:mi>N</mml:mi>;                   <mml:mo>=</mml:mo>;                   <mml:mn>504</mml:mn>;                 </mml:mrow>;               </mml:math></jats:alternatives></jats:inline-formula>), we used the same methodology to compare the effectiveness of eight different comparative justification strategies. We presented pairs of recipes twice to users: once <jats:italic>without</jats:italic> and once <jats:italic>with</jats:italic> a pairwise justification. Results indicated that justifications led to significantly healthier choices for first course meals, while strategies that compared food features and emphasized health risks, benefits, and a user’s lifestyle were most effective, catering to health-related choice motivations.; </jats:p>",,,,,Popularity; Recipe; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Recommender system; Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Algorithm; Information retrieval; World Wide Web; Psychology; Food science; Social psychology; Chemistry,,,,Norges Forskningsråd; Norges Forskningsråd,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11257-023-09377-8.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11257-023-09377-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11257-023-09377-8,,10.1007/s11257-023-09377-8,,,0,000-974-850-592-846; 003-863-773-497-948; 004-563-081-819-645; 006-242-261-935-825; 007-681-004-340-40X; 009-299-623-546-736; 013-732-205-761-117; 013-851-999-983-177; 018-352-462-392-305; 018-355-420-070-002; 019-222-331-081-946; 019-723-259-601-77X; 023-784-213-655-549; 025-969-203-662-300; 029-246-453-669-536; 030-541-115-416-613; 032-894-531-555-74X; 036-438-256-054-225; 038-202-287-447-023; 038-501-193-105-962; 040-287-227-383-731; 043-423-107-347-86X; 047-981-568-599-033; 048-151-969-765-454; 048-508-473-959-334; 050-374-743-416-630; 050-438-649-804-098; 050-796-713-725-264; 050-968-082-006-80X; 054-207-687-803-915; 054-857-684-584-563; 054-984-231-116-048; 055-722-022-375-111; 062-034-825-969-25X; 063-440-015-049-822; 063-596-870-352-348; 065-525-419-661-503; 066-332-855-740-000; 068-157-575-334-072; 068-310-890-610-223; 073-103-708-114-75X; 073-492-698-904-302; 074-738-582-187-288; 076-453-084-725-630; 080-575-964-448-299; 080-812-115-678-061; 084-192-832-537-852; 085-434-462-661-463; 086-532-296-334-621; 086-905-224-139-391; 088-014-553-001-565; 089-583-166-301-353; 091-243-016-708-511; 091-404-311-572-535; 097-491-099-406-80X; 100-278-466-181-571; 101-109-654-217-702; 106-373-640-862-780; 109-500-690-901-344; 109-726-928-981-957; 112-641-597-382-321; 119-128-530-741-972; 123-196-835-613-962; 124-240-017-237-848; 125-953-451-982-564; 145-649-408-314-463; 149-002-862-755-654; 152-059-777-938-937; 172-547-916-143-05X,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Ashley Steel; Nadine Fleischhut,"Abstract. Earthquake models can produce aftershock forecasts, which have recently been released to lay audiences following large earthquakes. While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location’s forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1) forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2) the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3) two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. Unlike previous experiments, we compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that are systematically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a comparative judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.",,,,,Data mining; Creative visualization; Aftershock; Readability; Task (project management); Color scheme; Potential risk; Visualization; Computer science; Transparency (graphic),,,,,https://meetingorganizer.copernicus.org/EGU21/EGU21-8318.html https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021EGUGA..23.8318S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/egusphere-egu21-8318,,10.5194/egusphere-egu21-8318,3163103225,,0,,0,false,,

For better accuracy, both the number of DNN models and the model-complexity have been increased. To properly respond to this, hardware platforms structured with multicore-based CPUs and DNN accelerators have been released, and the GPU is generally used as an accelerator. When multiple DNN workloads are sporadically requested, the GPU can be easily oversubscribed, thereby leading to an unexpected performance bottleneck. We propose an on-device CPU-GPU co-scheduling framework for multi-DNN execution to remove the performance barrier precluding DNN executions from being bounded by the GPU. Our framework fills up the unused CPU cycles with DNN computations to ease the computational burden of the GPU. To provide seamless computing environment for the two different core types, the framework formats each layer execution according to the computational methods supported by CPU and GPU cores. To cope with irregular arrivals of DNN workloads, and to accommodate their fluctuating demands for hardware resources, our framework dynamically selects the best fit core type after making a comparative judgement between the current availabilities of the two core types. During the core selection time, offline-trained prediction models are utilized to get precisely predicted execution time of the issued layer. Our framework mitigates the fact that even the same DNN models can have large performance deviations due to the nature of the process scheduler of the underlying OS which is GPU-agnostic. In addition, the framework minimizes the memory copy overhead inevitably occurring in the data synchronization phase between the heterogeneous cores. To do so, we further analyze GPU-to-CPU and CPU-to-GPU data transfer cases separately, and then apply the solution that best suits each case. For multi-DNN inference jobs with the NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier platform, our framework speeds up the execution time by up to 46.6% over the GPU-only solution.",9,,85403,85417,Overhead (computing); Data synchronization; Parallel computing; Bottleneck; Field (computer science); Computer science; Data transmission; Multi-core processor; Instruction cycle; Kernel (linear algebra),,,,National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) Grant through the Korean Government [Ministry of Science and ICT (MSIT)],https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/access/access9.html#LimK21a https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9453793/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/access.2021.3088861,,10.1109/access.2021.3088861,3169062287,,0,006-371-205-176-183; 006-674-774-628-280; 007-799-486-535-747; 012-450-313-455-799; 013-645-987-824-163; 016-522-107-313-517; 017-390-503-673-500; 024-123-329-503-158; 026-023-123-097-582; 026-605-813-589-98X; 027-431-899-146-90X; 027-539-991-826-929; 033-463-772-873-10X; 036-359-109-984-558; 036-633-754-863-352; 043-341-579-803-940; 053-049-271-576-088; 065-260-887-417-025; 069-918-208-327-743; 072-304-823-799-71X; 075-622-230-270-311; 077-675-041-270-883; 078-682-221-551-772; 089-666-254-392-316; 089-927-663-116-446; 091-659-602-256-991; 092-614-787-708-479; 095-000-402-265-914; 096-571-223-489-918; 102-004-580-342-863; 103-733-185-698-751; 105-642-495-371-85X; 107-302-007-075-544; 109-066-318-271-439; 111-276-567-771-159; 123-009-091-757-552; 159-778-387-875-905; 163-864-607-412-829; 163-942-199-361-129; 169-144-630-851-574; 176-081-699-575-633; 185-617-226-991-548; 191-293-104-594-084; 192-697-687-929-866; 195-091-532-336-938; 195-597-492-425-466,6,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

No previous study has defined and measured this construct through objective and quantitative procedures. We established a reliable method to measure meta-emotion. With a two-interval forced-choice procedure, participants selected which of two pictures elicited stronger positive emotion; via the Law of Comparative Judgment, their responses were used to compute individual psychological distances for the emotional responses triggered by the pictures. Then, participants were asked to judge whether a pre-exposed picture induced a stronger positive emotion than the median of that elicited by the whole picture set, followed by a confidence rating. By utilizing each individual's psychological distance, the correctness of a participant's emotional experience was quantified by d', and meta-emotion was quantified using meta-d', M-ratio, and M-diff as indices of metacognitive sensitivity and efficiency based on Signal-Detection Theory. Test-retest reliabilities, validated by Spearman correlation, were observed in meta-d', M-ratio, and marginally with M-diff, suggesting the stability of meta-emotion in the current design. This study unveils a validated procedure to quantify meta-emotion, extendable for assessing metacognition of other subjective feelings.

066-124-277-229-406,Political realism and the quest for political progress,2022-01-31,2022,journal article,Constellations,13510487; 14678675,Wiley,United Kingdom,Ilaria Cozzaglio; Greta Favara,"In this article, we propose to develop a realist interpretation of political progress—that is, an analysis of what it means to achieve better conditions of life in society under political power according to realist standards. Specifically, we are interested in identifying the criteria according to which political realism defines a change in the status quo as a desirable change. If our attempt is convincing, political realism will advance in two respects. First, our interpretation of political progress represents a theoretical effort that stands between purely methodological works on political realism (for example, Favara, 2021; Galston, 2010; Hall, 2017; Rossi & Sleat, 2014) and the scholarship on applied realist normativity (for example, Beetz & Rossi, 2017; Bellamy, 2010; Cozzaglio, 2020; Jubb, 2015), which allows it to offer tools to bridge the gap between abstract and practical interpretations of realist normativity. Our account stands between these two theoretical efforts in the following ways. First, through our interpretation of political progress, we provide some insight into political judgment in a realist sense. Second, we provide general realist guidelines to evaluate political changes. As for the second advance, advocates and critics of political realism have recently engaged in a growing debate about the normative import of realist normativity. Political realists have often been seen either as compliant with the status quo or as silently relying on moral principles in order to grant any normative import to their political theories.1 At stake is the normative capacity of political realism itself and, consequently, its ability to offer political guidance for making progress in society. Although realists have provided a number of responses to the accusation of status quo bias (for example, Favara, 2021; Finlayson, 2017; Jubb, 2019), developing a realist notion of political progress would further show that such criticism is undeserved. However, speaking of political progress in realist terms presents some challenges. If realists want to be loyal to their methodological commitment—namely, the priority of politics over morality—they need to rethink the notion of progress in a way that is not based on prepolitical moral assumptions. As we discuss below, such a methodological constraint exposes a realist interpretation of political progress to charges of inconsistency, excessive conservatism, and ideological bias. Hence, by defending our interpretation of realist political progress, we aim to counter such possible worries as well. Our article is structured as follows. In section 2, we explain the fundamental requirements that a notion of political progress must satisfy in order to be considered a realist notion of progress and the main challenges that a realist account of progress needs to meet to consistently abide by the requirements. In section 3, we present our notion of realist political progress as composed of three dimensions: inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection. Section 4 shows the contextualist nature of our notion of progress by distinguishing concept and conceptions of progress. Finally, we argue for the merits of realist political progress and address possible objections to our account (sections 5 and 6). It is notably not easy to define what political realism consists in. Indeed, the theorists who have been labeled as realists come from a number of different backgrounds. Relatedly, we cannot claim that the account offered here is either exhaustive of political realism or uncontroversial. Still, because some family resemblances among realist political thinkers can be traced (McQueen, 2017), we believe that the account we propose offers a consistent and viable version of a realist political normativity. Political realism originated as a reaction to what Williams (2005) has called “moralism” in political theory—that is, the idea that political theory is reducible to “applied morality” (p. 2). In contrast to the moralist approach, Williams and contemporary realists argue that politics should be regulated by a distinctively political normativity grounded on at least three commitments. First, political realists conceive of their work neither as a study of political reality nor as a mere application of political theories to specific circumstances, but rather as a theoretical approach that grounds its normativity on the very definition of politics as different from domination (Sleat, 2016b). Some crucial features of political practices cannot be ignored when aiming to offer an adequate normative theory of politics: political practices are structured around power relationships and are permeated by conflicts of values and interests (Geuss, 2008; Rossi & Sleat, 2014). Relatedly, politics is primarily devoted to achieving order and to an effective and responsible2 use of power, despite the conflicts found in political contexts. So, politics is not reducible to successful domination. Second, realists argue that normative political theory should be sensitive to the political reality under assessment. As realists have often lamented, much contemporary political philosophy either tends to derive political theories from moral theories or is not sufficiently attentive to the complexity, specificities, and challenges of political reality (Geuss, 2008; Philp, 2008; Williams, 2005). According to realists, a lack of sensitivity to political reality is responsible for generating political theories that are normatively irrelevant (Honig, 1993; Horton, 2010b; Newey, 2001), descriptively inadequate (Horton, 2010a, 2010b), or even dangerous in actual political circumstances (Geuss, 2008; Mills, 2005). For this reason, political standards must not merely be normative tools that apply to politics; rather, they must be informed and shaped by an appraisal of what politics is in the first place. This feature counters a source of misunderstanding that identifies political realism as an investigation into the feasibility constraints that ought to apply to political theories (Valentini, 2012; but see Sleat, 2016a). Political theory ought to be an essentially practice-dependent endeavor, one in which political practices should be considered not as mere fields of application of independently stated norms, but rather as sources of normative knowledge (Galston, 2010; Jubb, 2016; Sangiovanni, 2008). This commitment makes political realism a contextualist approach to political normativity and motivates realists’ distancing of themselves from any normative theory with universalist pretenses. Relatedly, realist political theories must be understood as provisional, revisable, and conditionally constructed. Notwithstanding these two aspects, many realists believe that the distinctiveness of political normativity must not preclude the possibility of making moral considerations in politics. For example, Matt Sleat clarifies that antimoralism is far from fully rejecting the role of morality in politics (Sleat, 2021); rather, it requires that morality should not be the sole and ultimate ground for political standards. Moral values held by agents in specific historical and cultural circumstances play a role in justifying political power precisely because these values make sense to those subject to the political authority. In this sense, these values do not represent a morality external, or prior, to politics (Sleat, 2014). Finally, realists regard the critique of ideologies as a fundamental task of political theorizing. Following Raymond Geuss (1981), ideologies represent “the beliefs the members of the group hold, the concepts they use, the attitudes and psychological disposition they exhibit, their motives, desires, values, predilections, works of art, religious rituals, gestures, etc.” (p. 5) and are therefore ineliminable elements of any political context. Ideology critique is, in turn, a process of reflection in which the foundation, genealogy, and consistency of beliefs are scrutinized (see Williams, 2002, pp. 225−32). Since starting from an undistorted appraisal of political reality is one of the core commitments of realist political theory, it becomes essential to get rid of those ideologies that result from false beliefs and contribute to forming a distorted picture of power relationships (Geuss, 2008). This concern becomes especially relevant for scrutinizing the effects of power in political relations, as beliefs can be actively manipulated by those who exercise power by distorting, hiding, or spreading information (Williams, 2002, 2005). So far, we have described what we take to be the main distinguishing features of realist political thought. Why, within this theoretical framework, is the attempt to provide an account of political progress troublesome? There are three reasons. First, contextualism might seem inconsistent with an account of political progress, as it seems to prevent the possibility of distancing oneself from and criticizing the status quo. Against the realists’ commitment to elaborating standards that vary across time and space, some may argue that a meaningful notion of political progress ought to presuppose unchangeable standards of evaluation, valid independently of the circumstances under consideration (Godlovitch, 2002).3 Absent those independent standards, it would seem unjustified to univocally describe political changes as progressions or regressions. Moreover, without a fixed and independent standard of evaluation that makes comparative judgments possible, the idea of progress would seem to lose its appeal and its most authentic meaning. Hence, for instance, we intuitively regard the abolition of slavery as a political change that counts as progress independently from the circumstances considered. In contrast, refusing to formulate judgments that claim universal validity seems to impoverish both the notion of political progress and its utility. Relatedly, political realists, to defend their normative approach from such criticism, need to explain how we can justify universal judgments such as the one against slavery without losing track of the contextual features informing political standards. Finally, earlier we mentioned that political realism demands that one engage in a process of ideology critique as a prerequisite for achieving an undistorted comprehension of political reality.4 Some realists, most notably Janosch Prinz and Enzo Rossi, have argued that realist political theorizing ought to be exclusively conducted by engaging in a process of criticizing ideologies, thereby refraining from outlining any substantive normative theory. According to Prinz and Rossi (2017, p. 355), this must be the case because every normative theory, by adopting a certain conceptual toolbox as a starting point, ends up examining and judging political reality through the lenses of some prepolitical, and hence nonrealist, notions. Accordingly, both realists and critics might argue that elaborating a conception of political progress is already an ideological move, one that “imposes” a certain interpretative meaning on the political circumstances that need to be understood.5 In the following, we develop an account of political progress that is able to both consistently abide by the fundamental theoretical commitments of realist political thought and address the challenges just outlined. Before elaborating the features of our notion of political progress, let us note that Bernard Williams's idea of a political relationship stands as the background of our reflection.6 Williams (2005) speaks of a political relationship as the solution to the “‘first’ political question in Hobbesian terms as the securing of order, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation” (p. 3). Significantly, not all exercises of power aimed at establishing order and cooperation are necessarily legitimate; a solution to the first political question needs to be “acceptable,” meaning it needs to not recreate the problem in response to which a political relationship was established in the first place. In this sense, a regime of terror does not count as an acceptable solution to the first political question (pp. 4−5). The basic legitimation demand (BLD) discriminates between acceptable and unacceptable solutions by presenting the following requirements. First, a justification for the exercise of political power, backed by coercion, must be offered “to each subject” (Williams, 2005, p. 4). Even so, some subjects seem to be excluded from the justificatory enterprise. The “radically disadvantaged,” Williams continues, are the ones to whom nothing can be said “to explain why they shouldn't revolt” (p. 5). Legitimacy is therefore a scalar notion: regimes are more or less legitimate depending on how widespread the condition of radical disadvantage is. Second, “the acceptance of a justification does not count if the acceptance itself is produced by the coercive power which is supposedly being justified” (p. 6). This is what Williams names the “critical theory principle.” Put differently, subjects’ acceptance of power does not count if the acceptance results from the regime's manipulation of them. Finally, the justification must make sense as an intelligible political order, given the historical and cultural circumstances (pp. 10−11). The BLD encapsulates Williams's (2005) broader idea of what a realist political theory should look like: “I want a broader view of the content of politics, not confined to interests, together with a more realistic view of the powers, opportunities, and limitations of political actors, where all the considerations that bear on political action—both ideals, and, for example, political survival—can come to one focus of decision” (p. 12). In this sense, politics comprises more than the struggle for power and survival; it is also a complex set of claims and achievements. Relatedly, we argue, political progress cannot be understood only as an increase in stability and in the chances of survival but should rather be evaluated according to more articulated and multifaceted criteria. In the following, we propose three criteria for evaluating political change: inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection. Yet before presenting them, a final remark is in order. We intend these criteria as guidelines for elaborating political judgments about societal changes, not features that, if maximally realized, would depict ideal political regimes. Relatedly, we do not conceive of realist political progress as a process of approximating ideal standards so defined. Rather, inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection are criteria that ought to be taken into consideration while assessing political changes, whose interaction cannot be constrained by fixed rules (for example, maximization) but ought to be established through contextual judgments. The exact terms according to which such contextual judgments ought to be interpreted are clarified in section 4, where we tackle the difference between concept and conceptions of progress. For the moment, it is sufficient to remark that as inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection are guidelines for elaborating political judgments, the resulting notion of progress does not presuppose either a blueprint of the progressive political regime or any ideal of realist legitimacy. As noted, a realist notion of political progress has three levels: inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection. The first one stems from the very idea of a political relationship as “the securing of order, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation” (Williams, 2005, p. 3). In fact, realists from different camps converge on the idea that politics is primarily an attempt to bring order and cooperation in circumstances of irresolvable and deep disagreement (Galston, 2010; Philp, 2010; Rossi, 2012).7 We mentioned before that only some solutions to the first political question are acceptable, or, in the comparative language used here, some solutions are better than others. Relatedly, we say that political progress is a change from worse to better solutions to the first political question, where the quality of the solution depends on the decrease in the proportion of subjects who are in a position of radical disadvantage. More specifically, we argue, political progress in inclusivity consists of an increase in the number of subjects to whom an acceptable justification for political power in terms of the provision of security, protection, safety, trust, and the conditions of cooperation is provided. In this sense, we observe political progress anytime that, first, subjects to whom security was not guaranteed before are now guaranteed safety and protection; and second, subjects can now accept a justification of the exercise of power on the basis of the provision of security, safety, and protection, for such a justification reflects their actual receiving of protection. Put in different terms, we see political progress in inclusivity anytime that subjects exit from a relation of domination and enter into a political relationship with the political authority. The second dimension of political progress is responsiveness. Recall that for realists, political standards must have a bottom-up source; that is, they need to be extrapolated from the political practice. Put differently, the ordering principles of a political community must match the values that are salient for the subjects living in that political community (Cozzaglio, 2021; Favara, 2021; Horton, 2012; Sagar, 2018; Sleat, 2014). Although the dimension of inclusivity considers the value of security as the primary and necessary one in a political relationship, we can plausibly expect that subjects require more than the provision of security and protection by the political authority. The dimension of responsiveness relates to the complex system of values and worldviews subjects hold about the political order they are coerced by. Accordingly, political progress in responsiveness consists in the increase in the extent to which subjects’ values are taken by the regime as grounding the political order. It concerns values beyond subjects’ claim to basic security. In other terms, responsiveness concerns the quality of the justification the regime provides to each subject, instead of the quantity of subjects to whom it provides a justification. Hence, responsiveness is distinct from inclusivity because the latter concerns the security of individuals who are provided with a justification for their being ruled, whereas the former concerns the compatibility of such justifications with subjects’ values. Finally, political progress can occur along the dimension of self-reflection. Recall Williams's (2005, p. 6) critical theory principle (CTP), according to which the acceptance of power cannot be produced by the same power that is to be justified. Where power is unequal, the CTP helps to shed light on the origin of a belief by asking whether subjects would still hold a given belief if they knew how it came about (Williams, 2002, p. 227). The CTP has inspired scholars belonging to different strands of political realism. Radical realists such as Rossi have interpreted it in epistemological terms in order to ground nonmoralistic vindicatory genealogy (Prinz & Rossi, 2017; Rossi, 2019). Others have taken steps beyond the CTP by developing internalist accounts of political legitimacy (Cozzaglio, 2021; Sagar, 2018). Still others have invoked it in order to delineate the difference between a political relationship and a relationship of domination, while eschewing an appeal to universal moral standards (Favara, 2021; Hall, 2017; Sleat, 2014). Regardless of these different emphases, realists agree that the CTP represents a form of critique that is compatible with antimoralism precisely because it is a form of internal critique—that is, one that does not presuppose a set of independent standards against which to measure power relationships. Accordingly, we deem the CTP to play a crucial role in a realist interpretation of political progress; moreover, we believe that it is possible to develop a minimal criterion for political progress in self-reflection that fits with the different interpretations of the role of the CTP just outlined. We argue that progress in self-reflection occurs anytime the conditions for reflecting upon the state of affairs—in terms of beliefs, shared values, institutional design—are improved. That is, we claim that progress in self-reflection occurs when there is an increase in the number of sources of information and in the possibilities for exchange of opinions, both within the regime and in dialogue with external interlocutors. The three dimensions are, to a certain extent, independent from each other, as a political regime might make progress only on one dimension while regressing, or staying still, on the others. However, the three dimensions of progress can also interact with each other in special ways, thereby giving rise to more complex and multifaceted political judgments. This can be seen by examining how self-reflection works in relation to the other two criteria of political progress. A society's progress in terms of self-reflection can affect progress in terms of both inclusivity and responsiveness. With regard to the former, self-reflection can help refine the standards for basic security by including dimensions that were not considered before. For example, basic security as protection from violence might be replaced by basic security as the active provision of means for survival or of means to live a flourishing life. In addition, internal critique can more closely assess whether basic security is actually being provided, by unveiling possible manipulative mechanisms on the part of the regime or ideological narratives that distort the perception of political facts, especially with reference to the actual provision of security. In these cases, elaborating political judgments about progress might entail assessing political change according to two or more interacting criteria. For example, if we cherish progress in terms of self-reflection (with respect to the values held by a given political community), we might want to further evaluate whether such progress has been followed by progress in terms of responsiveness (for instance, by looking at whether political practices have been enhanced in order to help include minorities’ worldviews in a system of principles that regulate the political order). Self-reflection can affect the dimension of responsiveness too. With regard to responsiveness, we previously argued that progress occurs whenever subjects’ values other than security are enhanced. Admittedly, though, the values held within even a single community could be the most disparate. As we previously noted, disagreement about worldviews is, according to realists, an unavoidable feature of the political realm and often entails that the polity establishes political standards and ordering principles that mirror only some subjects’ values. Such partiality surely results from existing trade-offs among different conceptions of what good politics is, but certainly also from existing hierarchies of power. After all, it is not difficult to imagine that the worldviews enhanced by the majority are more often realized at the expense of the needs of minorities. Accordingly, there is progress in terms of self-reflection anytime that minorities’ perspectives are taken into consideration with a committed attitude—that is, with the intention of providing them with increased responsiveness or at least of considering them eligible for increased responsiveness.8 Admittedly, it can be the case that some measures favoring minorities cannot be implemented, for reasons other than willingness to ignore the minorities’ worldviews (for example, scarcity of resources or resulting instability). Considerations of feasibility should surely play a role when assessing political changes, as a lack of progress in responsiveness toward these groups might not be due to a discriminatory political decision. For this reason, this requirement does not entail that progress occurs only if new stances are effectively implemented by the regime. Rather, progress occurs when different perspectives are taken into consideration with a committed attitude and the eventual refusal to implement them is accompanied by a justification that does not refer to an existing hierarchy of power.9 In the previous section, we argued that political progress consists in an increase in at least one of the three dimensions of progress we have identified: inclusivity, responsiveness, and self-reflection. These three dimensions constitute the core of a realist concept of progress. However, we still need to clarify how such dimensions should be employed and how they interrelate in the assessment of political changes. For this purpose, we now argue that the concept of progress must be distinguished from conceptions of progress. This allows us to explain why we conceive of the concept of progress as providing us with criteria for political judgment rather than providing defining features of ideal political regimes. As we saw, the concept of progress is grounded on an interpretation of the function of politics as the sphere of activity that is expected to bring order, security, stability, and the terms for effective cooperation in circumstances of unresolvable and permanent disagreement while providing a justification for power that is acceptable to subjects. Relatedly, political progress is change that helps fulfill the fundamental function of politics. In this sense, the concept of progress is a functional one, for it is construed by starting from an appraisal of the function of politics as a practice. Accordingly, the three dimensions of the concept of progress are evaluative criteria for measuring whether political changes represent betterments in the fulfillment of the function of politics. By being so characterized, the concept of progress transcends the specific political contexts under scrutiny, as it derives from an understanding of what politics is, as distinct from other spheres of human experience. Admittedly, the concept of progress so defined cannot, by itself, say anything about the content of the values and ordering principles that would enhance progressive political changes in a specific political society (at a certain time and place). Indeed, a concept of political progress can give rise to different substantive conceptions of political progress, depending on the specific political contexts in which we employ it. In contrast to the concept of political progress, conceptions of political progress are context sensitive, as they concern the specific values and ordering principles held in a given political society. Conceptions of progress are context sensitive in two respects. First, they are context sensitive to the extent that they determine the content of the formal criteria included in the concept of progress. For example, different societies with different cultural backgrounds might have different normative understandings of relevant notions, such as security, and of the function of politics. Such different understandings lead to different conceptions of progress, which are not to be interpreted as mere applications of a single ideal of politics to diverse political contexts. Indeed, recall that realist normativity is bottom-up: whether, and on what conditions, regimes include, or are responsive to, subjects depends upon subjects’ actual beliefs. Hence, the concept of progress is unable, prior to assessing the political context under investigation, to indicate what kind of political arrangements or reforms ought to be pursued; rather, the concept of progress merely provides formal criteria according to which the substantive normative principles ought to be justified on a contextual level. In this sense, conceptions of progress normatively depend on the concept of progress only to a limited extent; more specifically, the concept provides them with the criteria for elaborating in-context substantive political judgments. To give an example, imagine a regime (L) grounded on libertarian values and a regime (S) grounded on socialist values. In L, a conception of progress would probably entail reducing protectionist measures that conflict with the ideal of a free market. In contrast, a conception of progress in S would probably entail increasing the number of measures that strengthen the capacity of the community to provide its members with equal access to basic resources—for example, by implementing measures that protect the weakest industries. Conceptions of progress are context-dependent also in a second sense: They provide us with an ordering—albeit provisional and contextual—of the three criteria composing the concept of progress. Indeed, conceptions of progress are not merely intended to provide contextual implementations of three criteria of political progress in light of feasibility constraints. For one thing, the purpose of the concept of progress is not to specify an ideal of politics given by the fulfillment of the three criteria of progress. Moreover, the concept of progress does not order the three criteria according to a fixed hierarchy. Therefore, conceptions of progress must not be conceived of as recipes to maximize the three criteria of progress in actual circumstances. Rather, conceptions of progress provide context-based justifications of the hierarchy and the trade-offs ordering the three criteria of progress: by formulating conceptions of progress, one examines the specific context under scrutiny, and such an understanding allows one to formulate a normative conception of progress that hierarchically orders the criteria included in the concept of progress.

In the last 20 years, there has been considerable work internationally to support teachers in using assessment to improve student learning. However, there is a pressing issue that impedes teacher professional judgement being exploited to its full potential. The issue relates to teacher assessments in the context of extended performances such as essays and arises from the complexity of obtaining reliable or consistent teacher assessments of students’ work. Literature published in the United States, England and Australia details evidence of low reliability and bias in teacher assessments. As a result, despite policymakers’ willingness to consider making greater use of teachers’ judgements in summative assessment, and thus provide for greater parity of esteem between teachers’ assessment and standardised testing, few gains have been made. While low reliability of scoring is a pressing issue in contexts where the data are used for summative purposes, it also an issue for formative assessment. Inaccurate assessment necessarily impedes the effectiveness of any follow-up activity, and hence the effectiveness of formative assessment. In this session, Dr Sandy Heldsinger and Dr Stephen Humphry will share their research of writing assessment and explain how their research has led to the development of an innovative assessment process that provides the advantages of rubrics, comparative judgements and automated marking with few of the disadvantages.</jats:p>",,,,,Summative assessment; Rubric; Formative assessment; Judgement; Writing assessment; Context (archaeology); Mathematics education; Psychology; Work (physics); Computer science; Standards-based assessment; Pedagogy; Engineering; Political science; Mechanical engineering; Paleontology; Law; Biology,,,,,https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1028&context=rc21-30 https://doi.org/10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-1,http://dx.doi.org/10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-1,,10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-1,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Pitchford,"<jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>Interactive apps are commonly used to support the acquisition of foundational skills. Yet little is known about how pedagogical features of such apps affect learning outcomes, attainment and motivation—particularly when deployed in lower‐income contexts, where educational gains are most needed. In this study, we analyse which app features are most effective in supporting the acquisition of foundational literacy and numeracy skills. We compare five apps developed for the Global Learning XPRIZE and deployed to 2041 out‐of‐school children in 172 remote Tanzanian villages. A total of 41 non‐expert participants each provided 165 comparative judgements of the five apps from the competition, across 15 pedagogical features. Analysis and modelling of these 6765 comparisons indicate that the apps created by the joint winners of the XPRIZE, who produced the greatest learning outcomes over the 15‐month field trial, shared six pedagogical features—autonomous learning, motor skills, task structure, engagement, language demand and personalisation. Results demonstrate that this combination of features is effective at supporting learning of foundational skills and has a positive impact on educational outcomes. To maximise learning potential in environments with both limited resources and deployment opportunities, developers should focus attention on this combination of features, especially for out‐of‐school children in low‐ and middle‐income countries.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>; <jats:boxed-text content-type=""box"" position=""anchor""><jats:caption><jats:title>Practitioner notes</jats:title></jats:caption><jats:p>What is already known about this topic; <jats:list list-type=""bullet"">; <jats:list-item><jats:p>Interactive apps are becoming common to support foundational learning for children both in and out of school settings.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; <jats:list-item><jats:p>The Global Learning XPRIZE competition demonstrates that learning apps can facilitate learning improvements in out‐of‐school children living in sub‐Saharan Africa.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; <jats:list-item><jats:p>To understand which app features are most important in supporting learning in these contexts, we need to establish which pedagogical features were shared by the winning apps.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; </jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>What this paper adds; <jats:list list-type=""bullet"">; <jats:list-item><jats:p>Effective learning of foundational skills can be achieved with a range of pedagogical features.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; <jats:list-item><jats:p>To maximise learning, apps should focus on combining elements of autonomous learning, motor skills, task structure, engagement, language demand and personalisation.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; <jats:list-item><jats:p>Free Play is not a key pedagogical feature to facilitate learning within this context.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; </jats:list></jats:p><jats:p>Implications for practice and/or policy; <jats:list list-type=""bullet"">; <jats:list-item><jats:p>When developing learning apps with primary‐aged, out‐of‐school children in low‐income contexts, app developers should try to incorporate the six key features associated with improving learning outcomes.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; <jats:list-item><jats:p>Governments, school leaders and parents should use these findings to inform their decisions when choosing an appropriate learning app for children.</jats:p></jats:list-item>; </jats:list></jats:p></jats:boxed-text>; </jats:p></jats:sec>",54,5,1273,1291,Numeracy; Personalization; Literacy; Psychology; Interactive Learning; Software deployment; Computer science; Mathematics education; Knowledge management; Pedagogy; Multimedia; World Wide Web; Operating system,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/bjet.13317 https://doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13317 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/20280867/Brit%20J%20Educational%20Tech%20-%202023%20-%20Huntington%20-%20Pedagogical%20features%20of%20interactive%20apps%20for%20effective%20learning%20of.pdf https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/19009894 https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/file/19009894/1/Brit%20J%20Educational%20Tech%20-%202023%20-%20Huntington%20-%20Pedagogical%20Features%20Of%20Interactive%20Apps%20For%20Effective%20Learning%20Of,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjet.13317,,10.1111/bjet.13317,,,0,004-956-370-274-327; 005-471-515-498-761; 015-347-778-524-76X; 016-178-367-287-757; 019-482-274-864-346; 024-684-550-097-830; 025-520-504-394-311; 044-989-706-491-344; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-536-828-107-498; 048-812-298-219-545; 053-205-556-867-729; 054-164-444-074-597; 055-991-283-210-150; 062-601-445-810-376; 070-899-104-264-017; 071-975-497-001-741; 072-167-429-855-367; 077-160-708-736-539; 081-477-410-428-63X; 086-983-329-955-671; 097-602-534-216-541; 102-527-935-396-717; 103-741-488-276-775; 103-811-615-055-643; 105-484-433-927-639; 129-926-047-226-953; 130-225-916-054-932; 130-739-377-859-464; 135-472-220-820-82X; 182-788-370-570-18X,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

For example, they argue that we should each refrain from meat-eating and avoid buying sweatshop-made clothing. The case they advance for such prescriptions can seem intuitive and compelling: by acting in those ways, a person might help prevent serious harms from being produced at little or no personal cost, and so one should act in those ways. But I argue that such reasoning often relies on an overly simplistic assessment of the costs and benefits of those prescriptions, one that misconstrues or neglects important issues. Indeed, a closer look at those costs and benefits reveals just how little we often know about a number of real-world matters that bear on the expected consequences of the prescribed individual actions. Our predicament is one of radical uncertainty: we currently lack a sound basis for concluding that the relevant actions are more likely to do good than to backfire. I distinguish this empirically grounded objection from others, which are not convincing—including one based on the mere conceivability of the actions in question backfiring and another based on the supposition that such actions cannot make a difference in addressing the massive problems at issue. The upshot is that, at least for now, consequentialist arguments for many specific individual actions aimed at addressing large-scale harms are inconclusive.",25,3,1,25,Moral responsibility; Economics; Law and economics; Global justice; Animal ethics; Consequentialism; Utilitarianism; Clothing; Scale (social sciences); Political philosophy,Animal ethics; Consequentialism; Consumer ethics; Global justice; Utilitarianism; Vegetarianism,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10892-020-09358-8.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/NATIRL https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10892-020-09358-8 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC8117451,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10892-020-09358-8,34002108,10.1007/s10892-020-09358-8,3161865995,PMC8117451,0,002-131-530-724-691; 002-396-920-976-767; 003-488-463-486-053; 004-091-773-964-074; 010-463-394-518-164; 027-092-687-077-080; 030-280-258-086-575; 032-803-124-882-886; 034-866-732-135-623; 035-644-363-360-958; 035-715-894-955-235; 054-817-638-992-05X; 057-407-306-167-86X; 065-092-458-729-311; 075-344-084-811-169; 076-430-400-688-754; 125-661-450-848-529; 126-267-211-588-871; 128-786-037-646-85X; 131-385-009-728-47X; 133-527-004-773-814; 137-154-342-677-493; 161-661-689-124-632; 164-218-820-605-646; 167-289-743-022-224; 168-150-440-686-533; 168-645-051-006-113; 172-132-462-845-780; 186-494-148-402-048; 190-180-744-177-951,0,true,,green

We present three studies that attempted, without the use of graded candidate scripts, to replicate and extend previous results about standards in mathematics examination papers. We found that re-typesetting examination papers into a consistent format was necessary, but that comparative judgement of examination papers without an archive of graded candidate scripts offered a reliable and efficient method for revealing relative demand over time. Our approach enables standards comparison where previously this was not possible. We found a reasonable correlation between judgments of actual student scripts and judgments of the items only, meaning that conclusions may be drawn about the demand of examination papers even when graded candidate scripts are not available.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",3,2,79,90,Scripting language; Replicate; Judgement; Computer science; Meaning (existential); Information retrieval; Psychology; Statistics; Mathematics; Programming language; Law; Political science; Psychotherapist,,,,,https://pdf.ejmse.com/EJMSE_3_2_79.pdf https://doi.org/10.12973/ejmse.3.2.79 https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Comparing_examination_standards_without_graded_candidate_scripts/20457213/1/files/37468444.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/Comparing_examination_standards_without_graded_candidate_scripts/20457213,http://dx.doi.org/10.12973/ejmse.3.2.79,,10.12973/ejmse.3.2.79,,,0,000-505-014-359-035; 009-805-749-606-465; 014-206-860-413-123; 017-077-125-773-326; 017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-096-037-037-42X; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-966-099-589-64X; 036-417-407-984-911; 048-091-210-665-560; 052-220-359-018-487; 060-156-368-794-919; 066-908-670-161-319; 071-693-704-436-604; 119-283-616-515-247; 144-470-591-189-747; 148-673-033-661-432; 160-805-237-718-329; 174-126-769-677-162,0,true,,gold

We find individuals tasked with assessing the area of two objects do so by comparing the objects' dimensions, and thus subtle changes in the objects' dimensions can impact area assessments. Because a typical elongation bias experiment places two objects side-by-side horizontally and varies the elongation ratio while maintaining the same area, height is generally easier to compare than width. Thus, there will exist a region where the change in height noticeably crosses a perceptual just noticeable difference boundary, but the corresponding change in width does not, and individuals will tend to perceive that the taller object has a greater area or volume. Consistent with this proposed process, we suggest that, although the elongation bias occurs under a comparative judgment, it does not do so under a single judgment situation.

We focus on a practical scenario where we are given a shoestring budget (say cn for a small c such as 2 or 3) where the usual sample complexity bounds for winner recovery become useless. We focus on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model for noisy comparisons and propose PARWiS, a novel algorithm for Pairwise Active Recovery of Winner under a Shoestring budget. Our algorithm is based on an active version of a spectral ranking procedure combined with a pair selection procedure. We consider several natural disruption measures for the pair selection procedure and show that they are theoretically equivalent to moving along certain gradient directions of popular estimation objectives. We perform extensive synthetic and real-world experiments to show that our algorithm recovers the item at the top effectively with shoestring budgets and outperforms several state-of-the-art algorithms.",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Ranking (information retrieval); Focus (optics); Computer science; Selection (genetic algorithm); Set (abstract data type); Sample (material); Selection algorithm; Mathematical optimization; Artificial intelligence; Algorithm; Mathematics; Chemistry; Physics; Chromatography; Optics; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icdm51629.2021.00068,,10.1109/icdm51629.2021.00068,,,0,,0,false,,

Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) has been employed to achieve this alignment by combining a reward model, typically based on Bradley-Terry paired comparison, with an RL algorithm such as Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) to optimize LLM responses. However, RLHF exhibits complexity, instability, and sensitivity to hyperparameters. In this paper, we propose Preference Ranking Optimization (PRO) as an alternative to PPO for directly aligning LLMs with the Bradley-Terry comparison. PRO extends the pairwise Bradley-Terry comparison to accommodate preference rankings of any length. By iteratively contrasting the likelihood of generating responses, PRO instructs the LLM to prioritize the best response while progressively ranking the remaining responses. In this manner, PRO effectively transforms human alignment into aligning the probability ranking of $n$ responses generated by LLM with the preference ranking of humans towards these responses. Experiments have shown that PRO outperforms existing alignment algorithms, achieving comparable results to ChatGPT and human responses through automatic-based, reward-based, GPT-4, and human evaluations. Furthermore, we demonstrate that longer, more diverse, and higher-quality preference ranking sequences can consistently enhance the performance of human alignment.",,,,,Ranking (information retrieval); Pairwise comparison; Preference; Hyperparameter; Preference learning; Computer science; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Sensitivity (control systems); Statistics; Mathematics; Engineering; Electronic engineering,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.17492,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2306.17492,,10.48550/arxiv.2306.17492,,,0,,0,true,,green

Here, we show that exogenous and endogenous attention produces contrasting effects on apparent size. Participants performed a spatial pre-cueing comparative judgement task that had been frequently used to test the attentional effects on visual perception. The results showed that a smaller stimulus within the focus of exogenous attention was perceived to be equal in size as a larger unattended stimulus, whereas a larger stimulus within the focus of endogenous attention was perceived to be equal in size as a smaller unattended stimulus. In other words, exogenous attention increased the perceived size while endogenous attention decreased the perceived size. The contrasting effects may be attributed to the mechanism that exogenous attention favours parvocellular processing for which more neurons with smaller receptive fields (RFs) are activated for a given size, whereas endogenous attention favours magnocellular processing for which fewer neurons with larger RFs are activated. This finding shows that exogenous and endogenous attention acts differentially on size perception, and provides supportive evidence for the distinct mechanisms underlying the two types of attentional processing.",113,1,153,175,Parvocellular cell; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Endogeny; Neuroscience; Visual perception; Receptive field; Size Perception; Apparent Size; Mechanism (biology),endogenous attention; exogenous attention; size perception; visual pathway,Attention; Cues; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Size Perception; Space Perception; Visual Perception,,Guangdong Basic and Applied Basic Research Foundation (2021A1515010840); National Natural Science Foundation of China (31500919); Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (20wkzd12),https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12529,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjop.12529,34435351,10.1111/bjop.12529,3193507488,,0,002-251-605-388-597; 002-896-959-329-533; 003-234-688-368-621; 003-494-306-436-627; 003-942-092-049-168; 004-780-779-072-134; 005-938-338-478-108; 006-352-736-103-115; 006-635-819-665-420; 006-890-882-656-98X; 007-951-915-051-737; 008-857-219-070-913; 009-499-517-964-244; 010-087-841-033-008; 011-601-854-227-368; 012-765-147-718-763; 013-168-427-057-77X; 014-452-258-419-657; 014-568-640-265-841; 015-544-596-134-608; 016-619-705-994-528; 017-092-122-281-153; 018-727-872-285-105; 019-053-097-054-020; 019-070-518-571-38X; 019-396-393-456-846; 019-900-029-214-138; 020-434-770-645-838; 020-768-045-625-295; 020-801-848-755-431; 021-509-708-837-636; 021-706-576-030-98X; 022-869-218-220-903; 023-832-589-537-616; 024-215-699-434-354; 029-985-686-771-397; 031-857-734-617-606; 031-971-764-460-151; 032-049-177-406-929; 035-858-014-020-019; 035-865-384-989-770; 040-308-909-326-961; 040-315-054-207-195; 045-355-340-347-429; 046-189-498-065-646; 047-123-318-345-961; 047-641-832-638-740; 053-929-711-047-063; 054-472-182-870-394; 054-514-647-022-073; 056-058-144-104-41X; 056-141-522-259-193; 056-928-581-862-768; 057-087-266-929-857; 057-590-452-747-502; 059-424-379-092-456; 061-687-103-177-340; 062-850-728-477-515; 062-883-247-453-409; 065-481-468-423-673; 067-454-415-212-927; 072-966-002-109-008; 078-533-995-728-034; 079-462-073-125-262; 084-702-821-865-276; 085-951-007-325-666; 088-827-300-195-697; 090-557-933-029-212; 091-403-693-933-361; 094-135-895-612-831; 096-155-872-966-355; 096-715-611-858-375; 097-088-072-138-374; 098-064-374-030-377; 109-176-012-201-937; 113-805-373-613-64X; 118-168-633-990-285; 121-593-252-566-54X; 127-593-398-340-277; 131-886-841-633-693; 163-307-707-970-578; 166-571-010-923-650; 171-293-257-714-862; 184-392-049-446-15X; 199-497-399-935-24X,1,false,,

But paternalistic policies may give us reason to be concerned about superiority or contempt in policy-makers towards the citizens at whom they are directed.

Designing an AI teacher test is challenging: although evaluation methods are much-needed, there is no off-the-shelf solution to measuring pedagogical ability. This paper reports on a first attempt at an AI teacher test. We built a solution around the insight that you can run conversational agents in parallel to human teachers in real-world dialogues, simulate how different agents would respond to a student, and compare these counterpart responses in terms of three abilities: speak like a teacher, understand a student, help a student. Our method builds on the reliability of comparative judgments in education and uses a probabilistic model and Bayesian sampling to infer estimates of pedagogical ability. We find that, even though conversational agents (Blender in particular) perform well on conversational uptake, they are quantifiably worse than real teachers on several pedagogical dimensions, especially with regard to helpfulness (Blender: {\Delta} ability = -0.75; GPT-3: {\Delta} ability = -0.93).",,,,,Helpfulness; Test (biology); Computer science; Mathematics education; Probabilistic logic; Generative model; Reliability (semiconductor); Artificial intelligence; Generative grammar; Psychology; Social psychology; Paleontology; Biology; Power (physics); Physics; Quantum mechanics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.07540,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2205.07540,,10.48550/arxiv.2205.07540,,,0,,2,true,,green

Our findings contribute to research on the spatial contiguity principle, which recommends that related educational pictures and text should be displayed close together. In our first study, we used a comparative judgement technique to ask three groups of textbook users to compare real-world textbook expositions. Participants tended to perceive expositions as higher in quality if diagrams were placed in the main text rather than the margins. In a second study, we used eye tracking to explore whether students read expositions differently when diagrams were placed differently. Participants attended less to diagrams in the margins than to those in the main text. The findings of both studies suggest that authors should attend to the spatial contiguity principle when designing mathematics textbooks.",,,1,21,Contiguity; Judgement; Mathematics education; Perception; Quality (philosophy); Reading (process); Exposition (narrative); Diagram; Tracking (education); Psychology; Computer science; Mathematics; Pedagogy; Linguistics; Epistemology; Statistics; Operating system; Art; Philosophy; Literature; Neuroscience,,,,,https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_spatial_contiguity_principle_in_mathematics_textbooks/21731594/1/files/39717088.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_spatial_contiguity_principle_in_mathematics_textbooks/21731594,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14794802.2022.2158122,,10.1080/14794802.2022.2158122,,,0,003-685-374-916-587; 004-725-002-841-668; 006-318-611-113-804; 007-433-656-773-195; 008-663-672-726-559; 009-188-653-702-507; 009-194-550-637-248; 010-877-118-393-65X; 012-869-753-048-76X; 013-632-491-633-280; 016-279-152-792-986; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-886-709-886-069; 023-502-780-994-231; 024-409-782-689-652; 025-126-404-496-323; 025-993-487-185-912; 026-140-166-599-34X; 028-526-685-317-513; 029-772-752-011-734; 032-709-967-155-328; 033-704-157-763-050; 034-678-018-609-213; 035-449-750-501-892; 035-674-864-411-052; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-966-099-589-64X; 036-417-407-984-911; 037-126-092-263-525; 038-342-772-711-355; 039-659-432-594-991; 039-995-006-991-890; 040-241-846-826-833; 044-654-759-462-243; 046-728-804-165-726; 048-091-210-665-560; 050-119-188-238-442; 052-520-536-205-924; 058-738-904-049-057; 060-156-368-794-919; 062-207-490-323-678; 066-873-808-337-691; 068-124-584-046-362; 072-079-685-952-529; 075-764-766-017-06X; 076-043-020-170-865; 076-163-610-880-070; 080-954-597-833-661; 088-890-301-116-921; 095-915-337-287-265; 104-269-678-535-926; 106-175-593-633-696; 108-528-140-455-464; 117-861-761-816-651; 125-436-060-973-470; 126-742-810-369-136; 127-107-242-183-686; 141-498-452-403-040; 148-673-033-661-432; 152-236-558-163-291; 160-805-237-718-329; 166-289-182-361-827; 166-315-357-513-375; 174-170-092-154-316; 177-072-688-486-223,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

In this work, we question the use of averages for aggregating evaluation scores into a final number used to decide which system is best, since the average, as well as alternatives such as the median, ignores the pairing arising from the fact that systems are evaluated on the same test instances. We illustrate the importance of taking the instance-level pairing of evaluation scores into account and demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, the advantages of aggregation methods based on pairwise comparisons, such as the Bradley-Terry (BT) model, a mechanism based on the estimated probability that a given system scores better than another on the test set. By re-evaluating 296 real NLP evaluation setups across four tasks and 18 evaluation metrics, we show that the choice of aggregation mechanism matters and yields different conclusions as to which systems are state of the art in about 30% of the setups. To facilitate the adoption of pairwise evaluation, we release a practical tool for performing the full analysis of evaluation scores with the mean, median, BT, and two variants of BT (Elo and TrueSkill), alongside functionality for appropriate statistical testing.",,,2301,2315,Artificial intelligence; Test set; Set (abstract data type); Pairwise comparison; Natural language processing; Test (assessment); TrueSkill; Mechanism based; Better than average; Computer science; Statistical hypothesis testing,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10746v1 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.10746.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.179,,10.18653/v1/2021.acl-long.179,3207902445; 3174451219,,0,007-132-721-332-101; 008-497-505-145-895; 011-105-391-999-886; 012-256-407-171-093; 015-021-151-031-582; 018-538-604-213-540; 021-896-779-935-682; 023-135-016-181-647; 026-921-210-110-065; 034-368-021-877-821; 035-398-003-049-284; 039-641-605-243-490; 044-268-654-736-388; 050-499-609-238-924; 052-344-504-631-259; 054-692-668-670-717; 063-202-458-639-270; 064-176-452-338-805; 069-480-623-909-181; 075-673-388-945-841; 082-597-956-517-75X; 087-991-691-200-809; 095-254-612-256-75X; 096-792-219-914-941; 096-896-377-991-551; 105-202-828-216-745; 106-503-121-876-059; 112-714-330-059-351; 114-187-863-958-713; 133-646-303-399-086; 139-271-196-900-76X; 147-128-564-690-566; 150-417-993-876-480; 154-760-544-889-490; 163-695-250-099-58X; 176-294-847-382-833; 178-025-586-211-020; 184-669-512-345-166; 195-706-909-301-830,4,true,cc-by,hybrid

In some cases, it may be reasonable to assume that the preferences expressed by individuals depend on their characteristics. Within the framework of tree-based partitioning, we specify a tree-based model estimating the joint effects of subject-specific covariates over and above their main effects. We combine a tree-based model and the log-linear Bradley-Terry model using the outcome of the comparisons as response variable. The proposed model provides a solution to discover interaction effects when no a-priori hypotheses are available. It produces a small tree, called trunk, that represents a fair compromise between a simple interpretation of the interaction effects and an easy to read partition of judges based on their characteristics and the preferences they have expressed. We present an application on a real data set following two different approaches, and a simulation study to test the model's performance. Simulations showed that the quality of the model performance increases when the number of rankings and objects increases.

Several studies have indicated that the combined use improves forest planning by applying a set of key criteria to simultaneously evaluate various ecosystem services.;  Forest landscapes are essential elements for the provision of ecosystem services and they contribute to human well-being. The identification of management options that consider various objectives and stakeholder interests requires strong decision support tools. We review the current state of knowledge on the use of decision-making approaches in combination with geospatial technologies, and the criteria most often used to assess supporting and cultural services in scientific literature. The analysis demonstrated that Analytic Hierarchy Process is the most common method used in combination with spatial knowledge due to its simple principles (decomposition, comparative judgment, priority synthesis) and effective work-flow to evaluate potential decision alternatives and support reproducible results. Key criteria used in the analysis are: distance to road, water bodies, slope, and vegetation cover. Easy to use methods allow a broad and participatory engagement of layman in the decision process. More advanced techniques might be used by experts to produce more robust and reliable results. Future research should provide easy access to the spatial information of the key criteria to utilize synergistic effects.",78,2,1,19,Risk analysis (engineering); Spatial analysis; Stakeholder; Participatory planning; Scientific literature; Computer science; Geographic information system; Ecosystem services; Analytic hierarchy process; Geospatial analysis,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13595-021-01049-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13595-021-01049-0,,10.1007/s13595-021-01049-0,3154946247,,0,000-098-583-291-813; 000-987-855-540-378; 002-020-304-562-725; 002-118-629-868-680; 002-666-554-957-968; 003-445-100-133-507; 004-617-543-085-799; 009-141-348-039-990; 010-253-891-912-191; 011-090-436-808-192; 012-299-622-870-84X; 012-756-026-676-881; 013-398-882-755-215; 015-766-554-864-411; 015-945-270-019-877; 024-125-674-312-052; 025-004-448-119-268; 029-934-165-371-945; 032-103-477-519-049; 032-313-173-149-54X; 033-442-076-555-551; 034-350-891-268-709; 039-970-993-010-206; 041-273-498-286-895; 042-840-245-896-77X; 043-613-382-638-538; 043-698-865-503-975; 044-791-345-910-81X; 048-209-354-121-459; 049-127-932-694-513; 052-184-630-157-367; 053-240-076-031-344; 055-635-470-999-790; 057-176-865-915-179; 057-771-417-364-058; 058-192-966-223-16X; 058-853-446-157-117; 061-246-180-664-712; 063-182-862-061-946; 064-942-700-062-108; 065-509-079-361-52X; 066-008-619-962-571; 069-214-292-523-732; 069-699-401-815-020; 071-696-262-310-492; 071-847-097-690-211; 072-653-874-202-608; 073-707-635-996-84X; 074-319-454-299-318; 075-726-846-781-685; 075-730-002-292-98X; 076-690-606-166-821; 078-979-908-653-465; 080-724-759-730-013; 083-521-489-278-280; 084-573-523-825-454; 085-100-242-423-252; 085-575-607-513-058; 090-581-871-641-202; 095-837-804-354-607; 096-553-441-648-199; 103-295-024-640-703; 103-589-069-375-126; 105-351-083-427-853; 106-153-340-661-27X; 107-101-437-893-271; 110-401-992-531-715; 112-159-298-347-299; 113-021-100-175-933; 114-039-365-961-675; 116-283-382-383-405; 119-102-703-243-782; 125-207-679-674-272; 127-092-397-858-562; 129-302-444-644-168; 131-123-818-539-214; 131-634-274-914-470; 132-594-170-051-650; 137-221-152-931-312; 141-415-852-659-962; 143-508-542-659-524; 143-657-271-137-212; 145-445-557-643-733; 149-180-210-939-388; 151-540-396-276-76X; 157-019-759-969-778; 158-393-839-240-06X; 162-894-660-087-931; 167-109-342-678-846; 176-046-814-170-866; 176-992-610-708-370,8,true,cc-by,gold

The Bradley-Terry model is a classical statistical method for ranking based on paired comparisons. The PageRank algorithm ranks nodes according to their importance in a network. Whereas Bradley-Terry scores are computed via maximum likelihood estimation, PageRanks are derived from the stationary distribution of a Markov chain. More recent work has shown maximum likelihood estimates for the Bradley-Terry model may be approximated from such a limiting distribution, an interesting connection that has been discovered and rediscovered over the decades. Here we show - through relatively simple mathematics - a connection between paired comparisons and PageRank that exploits the quasi-symmetry property of the Bradley-Terry model. This motivates a novel interpretation of Bradley-Terry scores as 'scaled' PageRanks, and vice versa, with direct implications for citation-based journal ranking metrics.",,,,,PageRank; Computer science; Information retrieval,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07811,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2402.07811,,10.48550/arxiv.2402.07811,,,0,,0,true,,green

Adaptive comparative judgments speed up the judgment process by maximizing the Fisher information of the next comparison. However, at the start of a judgment process, such an adaptive algorithm will not perform well. In order to reliably approximate the Fisher Information of possible pairs well, multiple comparisons are needed. In addition, adaptive comparative judgments have been shown to inflate the scale separation coefficient, which is a reliability estimator for the quality estimates. Current methods to solve the inflation issue increase the number of required comparisons. The goal of this study is to alleviate the cold-start problem of adaptive comparative judgments for essays or other textual assignments, but also to minimize the bias of the scale separation coefficient. By using text-mining techniques, which can be performed before the first judgment, essays can be adaptively compared from the start. More specifically, we propose a selection rule that is based both on a high (1) cosine similarity of the vector representations and (2) Fisher Information of essay pairs. At the start of the judgment process, the cosine similarity has the highest weight in the selection rule. With more judgments, this weight decreases progressively, whereas the weight of the Fisher Information increases. Using simulated data, the proposed strategy is compared with existing approaches. The results indicate that the proposed selection rule can mitigate both the cold-start. That is, fewer judgments are needed to obtain accurate and reliable quality estimates. In addition, the selection rule was found to reduce the inflation of the scale separation reliability.</jats:p>",7,,,,Pairwise comparison; Cosine similarity; Estimator; Similarity (geometry); Computer science; Selection (genetic algorithm); Process (computing); Artificial intelligence; Data mining; Machine learning; Statistics; Mathematics; Pattern recognition (psychology); Image (mathematics); Operating system,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.854378/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.854378 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/01GT93B304XPHZAD9APPYNAEST/file/01GT93J7576ZHBN59817X63JW3.pdf http://hdl.handle.net/1854/LU-01GT93B304XPHZAD9APPYNAEST https://lirias.kuleuven.be/bitstream/20.500.12942/702945/2/2022%2c%20De%20Vrindt%2c%20Text%20mining%2c%20Frontiers.pdf https://lirias.kuleuven.be/handle/20.500.12942/702945 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/01GT93B304XPHZAD9APPYNAEST/file/01GT93J7576ZHBN59817X63JW3,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.854378,,10.3389/feduc.2022.854378,,,0,012-371-292-791-041; 015-035-210-409-280; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-178-780-766-402; 022-886-709-886-069; 031-425-628-364-124; 035-966-099-589-64X; 048-091-210-665-560; 055-683-393-109-729; 055-785-457-627-128; 074-100-506-116-573; 081-370-959-105-221; 081-400-560-886-85X; 091-666-780-893-50X; 098-425-216-759-462; 098-643-686-833-28X; 114-193-703-964-242; 122-448-167-938-324; 131-055-739-915-443; 132-732-160-141-428,1,true,cc-by,gold

We conducted comparative judgement experiments in which students were asked to judge different proofs of the same theorem with five separate criteria: rigour, insight, understanding, simplicity and assessment marks. We predicted, and our experiment found, that rigour is a reliable construct. We predicted that insight is also a reliable construct but asking students to judge on the basis of ``which proof gives you more insight into why a theorem is true'' did not result in a reliable judging scale. Our analysis suggests two distinct dimensions: rigour and marks contribute to one factor whereas simplicity and personal understanding relate to a second factor. We suggest three reasons why insight was related almost equally to both factors. First, while comparative judgement was suitable for assessing some aesthetic criteria it may not be suited to investigating students conceptions of insight. Second, students may not have developed an aesthetic sense in which they appreciate insight in ways which are regularly discussed by mathematics educators. Lastly, insight may not be a coherent and well-defined construct after all.</p>",,,,,Mathematical proof; Epistemology; Computer science; Rigour,,,,,https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/en/publications/investigating-insight-and-rigour-as-separate-constructs-in-mathem,http://dx.doi.org/10.35542/osf.io/egks4,,10.35542/osf.io/egks4,3184835586,,0,,2,true,,green

Recent work has compared the different emotional characteristics between the violin and erhu on the Butterfly Lovers Concerto. In our study, we examine several hypotheses to investigate whether the previous studies’ results hold generally. Four musical excerpts were extracted from four famous Chinese and Western classical pieces, and the excerpts were divided into four emotional categories: Happy, Sad, Agitated, and Calm. Based on the Butterfly Lovers results, we expected that: (1) the violin has a more Happy emotional characteristic than the erhu, while the erhu is comparatively more Sad, and (2) the violin is better at conveying high-Arousal excerpts. We used the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) paired-comparison model to obtain the ranking scores and identify statistically significant differences between the two instruments.

In this method, people are first asked to make a comparative judgment such as “Is the number of new COVID-19 infections one month later more or less than 10 (or 200,000)?” As in this example, two sufficiently different anchors (e.g., “10” or “200,000”) are set in the comparative judgment. After this comparative judgment, people are asked to make their own estimates. These estimates are then aggregated. We hypothesized that the aggregated estimates using this method would be more accurate than those without anchor presentation. To examine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted three studies: a computer simulation and two behavioral experiments (numerical estimation of perceptual stimuli and estimation of new COVID-19 infections by physicians). Through computer simulations, we could identify situations in which the proposed method is effective. Although the proposed method is not always effective (e.g., when a group can make fairly accurate estimations), on average, the proposed method is more likely to achieve better wisdom of crowds. In particular, when a group cannot make accurate estimations (i.e., shows biases such as overestimation or underestimation), the proposed method can achieve better wisdom of crowds. The results of the behavioral experiments were consistent with the computer simulation findings. The proposed method achieved better wisdom of crowds. We discuss new insights into anchoring effects and methods for inducing diverse opinions from group members.</p>",,,,,Crowds; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Crowd simulation; Perception; Estimation; Anchoring; Group (periodic table); Artificial intelligence; Statistics; Psychology; Mathematics; Social psychology; Computer security; Engineering; Systems engineering; Chemistry; Organic chemistry; Neuroscience; Programming language,,,,,https://psyarxiv.com/9yv5q/download https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9yv5q https://osf.io/9yv5q/download https://osf.io/9yv5q/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/9yv5q,,10.31234/osf.io/9yv5q,,,0,,0,true,,green
085-197-634-626-378,Sharing and securing learners' performance standards across schools,,2022,conference proceedings article,Research Conference 2022: Reimagining assessment: Proceedings and program,,Australian Council for Educational Research,,Richard Kimbell,"<jats:p>Assessing learners’ performance makes very different demands upon teachers depending on the purpose and the context of the assessment. But common to all assessment is some sense of what ‘quality’ looks like. Most often teachers engage in formative assessments in the classroom, and the familiar standards of the classroom are adequate for this purpose. However if teachers are to undertake external, nationally regulated assessment then some sense of a national standard of quality is required. But there are very limited mechanisms by which teachers can acquire this understanding, so they use their best judgement, and standards vary from school to school not because anyone is attempting to cheat the system but simply because they cannot know what the real national standard is. It is for this reason that regulated examination bodies follow some process such as the following from the State Examinations Commission (SEC) in Ireland. ‘… teacher estimated marks will be subjected to an in-school alignment process and later a national standardisation process’. (SEC, 2021). How much simpler it would all be if teachers had – as a matter of normal practice – access to, and familiarity with, work from a national sample of schools, not just their own classroom. Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) is an online assessment tool that has been used for some years, principally as a formative tool for learners (e.g. Bartholomew et al., 2018; 2019). This presentation reports on a study of the new ACJ Steady State tool from the same stable. The purpose of the new tool is to solve the problem of variable standards across schools by enabling teachers to make paired judgements of work from multiple schools and thereby evolve and agree standards of performance beyond their own school. The current study is operating in Ireland with a group of schools, a university, and the SEC. The anticipated outcomes include 1) better consistency of performance standards across schools in the research group and 2) greater understanding of and confidence in assessment judgements by the teachers. If ACJ has proved to be a powerful formative assessment tool for learners, ACJ Steady State is designed to be a formative assessment tool for teachers, helping to inform and support their assessment judgements.</jats:p>",,,,,Formative assessment; Judgement; Context (archaeology); Psychology; Process (computing); Presentation (obstetrics); Mathematics education; Quality (philosophy); Pedagogy; Computer science; Medical education; Political science; Medicine; Paleontology; Philosophy; Radiology; Epistemology; Law; Biology; Operating system,,,,,https://research.acer.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1029&context=rc21-30 https://doi.org/10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-6,,10.37517/978-1-74286-685-7-6,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Some of the most widely studied judgments humans make from faces are evaluative judgments of facial attractiveness. These judgments are made frequently, automatically, and have important implications for judgments of other important social characteristics like trustworthiness and personality. A relatively understudied set of facial attractiveness judgments that are made from faces are comparative judgments, or social comparisons, of facial attractiveness. Based on social comparison theory, and what is known about evaluative judgments of facial attractiveness, it is likely that social comparisons of facial attractiveness are also frequent and have important implications. Despite this, little is known about social comparisons of facial attractiveness. To address this gap in the literature, three multi-method studies were conducted in this dissertation. The first was a systematic review to synthesize the existing research that directly or indirectly addressed social comparisons of facial attractiveness. Studies Two and Three empirically investigated whether or not social comparisons of facial attractiveness have features of automaticity. Study Two used a think aloud methodology to investigate the mandatory nature of social comparisons of facial attractiveness, whereas Study Three experimentally investigated how quickly social comparisons of facial attractiveness can be made. Together, these studies revealed more about how social comparisons of facial attractiveness occur and have theoretical implications for future research on the automaticity of mental processes more broadly.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Attractiveness; Face (sociological concept); Facial attractiveness; Face-to-face; Psychology; Computer science; Sociology; Social science; Epistemology; Psychoanalysis; Philosophy,,,,,https://rshare.library.torontomu.ca/articles/thesis/Face-to-Face_An_Investigation_of_Social_Comparisons_of_Facial_Attractiveness/25213664/1/files/44535149.pdf https://doi.org/10.32920/25213664.v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.32920/25213664.v1,,10.32920/25213664.v1,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

086-973-628-814-765,Learning from class and comparison labels,2021-05-10,2021,dissertation,,,Northeastern University Library,,Peng Tian,"We consider learning from comparison labels generated as follows: given two samples in a dataset, a labeler produces a label indicating their relative order. Such comparison labels often exhibit lower variance compared to class labels. We propose a means of producing a continuous severity score of Retinopathy of Prematurity (ROP), regressed from both noisy diagnostic class labels, as well as comparison outcomes. Our generative model combines the two sources, and successfully addresses inherent variability in diagnostic outcomes. In particular, our method exhibits an excellent predictive performance of both diagnostic and comparison outcomes over a broad array of metrics, including AUC, precision, and recall. In addition, we propose a new neural network architecture based on siamese networks to incorporate both class and comparison labels in the same training pipeline, using Bradley-Terry and Thurstone loss functions. We show that, by incorporating comparisons, training from few samples becomes possible: a deep neural network of 5.9 million parameters trained on 80 images attains a 0.92 AUC when incorporating comparisons. Finally, we analyze the sample complexity of pairwise comparisons under a rank regression setting, in which a dataset of samples is ranked by an oracle via pairwise comparisons. We propose an estimator for this setting and characterize its sampling complexity. In particular, we show that, to attain an accuracy $\epsilon&gt;0$, it suffices to conduct $\Omega(dN\log^3 N)$ comparisons when the number of samples is quadratic in $d$.",,,,,Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Estimator; Class (philosophy); Overfitting; Machine learning; Pattern recognition (psychology); Oracle; Pipeline (software); Artificial neural network; Variance (accounting); Mathematics; Statistics; Software engineering; Accounting; Business; Programming language,,,,,https://repository.library.northeastern.edu/files/neu:m046v3233/fulltext.pdf https://doi.org/10.17760/d20385567,http://dx.doi.org/10.17760/d20385567,,10.17760/d20385567,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location's forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1)Â forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2)Â the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3)Â two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. We compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that were specifically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a Comparative Judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the visual communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.",,,,,Visualization; Aftershock; Readability; Computer science; Data visualization; Transparency (behavior); Task (project management); Reading (process); Data mining; Engineering; Geology; Seismology; Computer security; Systems engineering; Law; Political science; Programming language,,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/1499/2022/nhess-22-1499-2022.pdf https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-rc1,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-rc1,,10.5194/nhess-2021-237-rc1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

O'Toole,"Confidence judgments serve as an indicator of identification accuracy in legal practices such as forensic face examination (Phillips et al., 2018). However, little research has focused on the factors that underlie these judgments. Moreover, it is not even clear whether people can evaluate the correctness of their face-identification decisions reliably through confidence reports. Previous studies show that confidence is a good indicator of accuracy when it is based on the strength of the sensory stimulus and when it is assessed with minimal bias (Mamassian, 2016; Wixted & Wells, 2017). Here, we implemented comparative judgments to measure confidence more directly and eliminate the risk of response bias imposed by the commonly used confidence scales (Mamassian, 2020; Phillips et al., 2018). Specifically, we tested participants (N = 58) on a confidence forced-choice task embedded in a face-identification test. On each face-identification trial, participants viewed three face images (two same-identity images, one different-identity image). The task was to select the odd-one-out. Upon completion of two face-identification trials (trial pair), participants compared the two decisions and selected the trial on which they felt more confident. To measure how task difficulty informs confidence decisions, we extracted item-difficulty estimates from an Item Response Theory model fitted to data collected separately. The difference in difficulty between the items in a trial pair predicted the proportion of higher-confidence judgments allocated to the easier item of the pair (R2 = 0.4924, F(1,50)= 50.48, p < .001). Performance was significantly more accurate on higher-confidence trials (M= 0.8853, SE= 0.0138), in comparison to lower-confidence trials (M=0.7924, SE=0.0176), (t(53) = 8.7689, p < .001, 95% CI:[ 0.0717, 0.1142], Cohen’s d=.7994). These findings show that people monitor task difficulty to evaluate the correctness of their face-identification decisions and comparative confidence judgments are good indicators of face-identification accuracy.",22,14,3341,3341,Correctness; Identification (biology); Psychology; Confidence interval; Task (project management); Face (sociological concept); Low Confidence; Social psychology; Computer science; Statistics; Mathematics; Algorithm; Social science; Botany; Management; Sociology; Economics; Biology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/jov.22.14.3341,,10.1167/jov.22.14.3341,,,0,,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Concept maps have become popular learning tools in various educational settings. However, the existing research has not fully explored the effectiveness of concept mapping as a learning tool nor analysed its utility as an assessment tool in mathematics. This study reports on the implementation and evaluation of a novel assessment, concept mapping, in a university mathematics course (<jats:italic>N</jats:italic> = 219). We investigated relationships between concept mapping performance and two major outcome variables: academic achievement and assessment self-efficacy (a two-factor measure comprising <jats:italic>Comprehension and Execution</jats:italic> and <jats:italic>Emotional Regulation</jats:italic>). Hierarchical multiple regression showed that concept mapping performance explains a statistically significant amount of variance in both the final exam scores and the <jats:italic>Emotional Regulation</jats:italic> factor of assessment self-efficacy after accounting for other conventional coursework assessments. The explained variance in the final exam suggests that concept mapping used as an assessment tool can detect and evaluate learners’ distinct capabilities that are not discerned by conventional assessments. Hence, concept mapping’s potential to assess conceptual understanding warrants further investigations. Moreover, the association with the emotional regulation efficacy measure suggests that concept mapping as a learning activity involves more positivity about the ability to succeed in facing challenges than a typical assignment. This potentially indicates more perseverance and effortful learning while actively engaged in meaning-making and the type of relational reasoning elicited by concept mapping.</jats:p>",113,3,475,498,Concept map; Coursework; Schema (genetic algorithms); Variance (accounting); Mathematics education; Comprehension; Psychology; Concept learning; Metacognition; Association (psychology); Meaning (existential); Meaningful learning; Educational assessment; Academic achievement; Computer science; Cognition; Machine learning; Neuroscience; Business; Psychotherapist; Programming language; Accounting,,,,Faculty of Science FRDF grant,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10649-023-10209-0.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10649-023-10209-0,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-023-10209-0,,10.1007/s10649-023-10209-0,,,0,001-123-473-969-169; 002-841-759-270-022; 005-461-513-963-501; 009-585-205-654-141; 012-073-919-509-375; 012-637-072-296-634; 019-372-839-061-325; 020-097-247-590-604; 023-054-571-880-266; 023-717-690-827-702; 023-841-699-476-820; 025-440-331-318-563; 026-108-915-930-82X; 029-829-548-606-76X; 030-268-260-642-284; 032-472-156-645-881; 032-709-967-155-328; 033-280-226-452-429; 036-408-540-095-940; 037-202-503-628-683; 038-407-639-323-446; 040-165-354-862-254; 040-241-846-826-833; 040-908-379-299-458; 041-662-126-083-375; 045-715-477-019-684; 046-405-525-173-110; 053-775-224-590-027; 053-804-495-453-331; 055-807-088-113-125; 062-023-623-245-663; 063-854-880-374-427; 065-822-431-068-527; 068-976-466-673-592; 070-001-943-944-204; 073-836-440-907-22X; 078-076-525-494-156; 080-023-493-629-126; 080-276-939-630-224; 081-155-610-461-715; 084-192-832-537-852; 087-420-155-317-780; 089-188-020-470-525; 090-794-868-877-416; 090-841-711-021-424; 091-691-656-102-453; 092-741-480-330-004; 095-339-879-052-599; 105-235-572-077-155; 108-507-872-863-68X; 109-788-736-886-22X; 113-838-773-411-458; 114-039-986-924-13X; 114-431-902-009-265; 122-051-422-070-628; 122-448-167-938-324; 122-586-529-271-99X; 122-753-639-205-42X; 132-041-108-973-718; 132-142-417-481-285; 135-675-115-956-67X; 145-873-082-515-340; 147-600-974-227-773; 153-009-600-964-874; 160-184-794-249-116; 170-737-853-402-759; 176-019-675-439-517,2,true,cc-by,hybrid

Despite the internationally recognized relevance of covariation, research shows that only a small percentage of students and teachers is able to adopt covariational reasoning and the majority of mathematics curricula do not contain explicit references to covariational skills. In particular, when covariational reasoning manifests as conceptual knowledge, it becomes challenging to assess, and the need for innovative methods of assessment emerges; there is a need for suitable assessment to highlight the characteristics of covariation and capture the various features that characterize conceptual understanding. Comparative judgement (CJ) is an innovative assessment method based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than requiring scoring rubrics. Due to its holistic approach, CJ is particularly suitable for assessing complex mathematical competencies, and, as we shall see in this study, it proved to be appropriate for the covariation’s assessment. In details, our study aims to investigate the perception and relevance attributed by mathematics teachers to covariation as a theoretical construct and the way CJ can help in the assessment of covariational reasoning skills underlying a less structured modelling task.</jats:p>",111,3,469,492,Rubric; Judgement; Relevance (law); Construct (python library); Mathematics education; Task (project management); Psychology; Perception; Curriculum; Concept learning; Computer science; Pedagogy; Epistemology; Philosophy; Management; Neuroscience; Political science; Law; Economics; Programming language,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10649-022-10178-w.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10649-022-10178-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-022-10178-w,,10.1007/s10649-022-10178-w,,,0,001-416-297-025-386; 001-635-003-044-638; 004-257-050-498-919; 009-194-550-637-248; 016-279-152-792-986; 016-906-489-941-537; 022-486-381-437-418; 033-463-746-640-812; 033-960-890-126-698; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-241-846-826-833; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 062-077-915-722-584; 066-854-131-782-393; 066-908-670-161-319; 081-958-569-563-216; 082-255-981-700-716; 082-657-515-340-970; 087-991-691-200-809; 105-837-618-652-02X; 107-526-861-867-383; 122-448-167-938-324; 124-894-018-464-121; 128-258-589-718-461; 133-972-645-991-470; 148-170-053-864-742; 163-379-589-157-078; 185-506-260-335-649,3,true,cc-by,hybrid

089-697-299-626-245,A Bayesian approach to time-varying latent strengths in pairwise comparisons.,2021-05-20,2021,journal article,PloS one,19326203,Public Library of Science (PLoS),United States,Blaž Krese; Erik Štrumbelj,"The famous Bradley-Terry model for pairwise comparisons is widely used for ranking objects and is often applied to sports data. In this paper we extend the Bradley-Terry model by allowing time-varying latent strengths of compared objects. The time component is modelled with barycentric rational interpolation and Gaussian processes. We also allow for the inclusion of additional information in the form of outcome probabilities. Our models are evaluated and compared on toy data set and real sports data from ATP tennis matches and NBA games. We demonstrated that using Gaussian processes is advantageous compared to barycentric rational interpolation as they are more flexible to model discontinuities and are less sensitive to initial parameters settings.

Various articulations of such techno-responsibility gaps have been proposed over the years, along with several potential solutions. Most of these solutions focus on 'plugging' or 'dissolving' the gaps. This paper offers an alternative perspective. It argues that techno-responsibility gaps are, sometimes, to be welcomed and that one of the advantages of autonomous machines is that they enable us to embrace certain kinds of responsibility gap. The argument is based on the idea that human morality is often tragic. We frequently confront situations in which competing moral considerations pull in different directions and it is impossible to perfectly balance these considerations. This heightens the burden of responsibility associated with our choices. We cope with the tragedy of moral choice in different ways. Sometimes we delude ourselves into thinking the choices we make were not tragic (illusionism); sometimes we delegate the tragic choice to others (delegation); sometimes we make the choice ourselves and bear the psychological consequences (responsibilisation). Each of these strategies has its benefits and costs. One potential advantage of autonomous machines is that they enable a reduced cost form of delegation. However, we only gain the advantage of this reduced cost if we accept that some techno-responsibility gaps are virtuous.",35,2,26,,Delegation; Moral responsibility; Argument (complex analysis); Morality; Delegate; Law and economics; Virtue; Tragedy (event); Environmental ethics; Sociology; Economics; Law; Political science; Computer science; Philosophy; Social science; Biochemistry; Chemistry; Programming language,AI; Burden of choice; Delegation; Illusions; Moral dilemmas; Responsibility; Responsibility gap; Robotics; Tragic choices,,,"National University Ireland, Galway",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13347-022-00519-1.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-022-00519-1 https://philpapers.org/archive/DANTCA-12.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/DANTCA-12,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13347-022-00519-1,35378903,10.1007/s13347-022-00519-1,,PMC8967079,0,002-556-398-707-934; 003-167-038-018-032; 003-475-354-542-631; 004-113-833-530-636; 004-278-540-635-19X; 005-040-269-760-79X; 011-074-725-304-433; 011-455-612-649-864; 011-558-500-155-060; 011-685-606-100-81X; 012-319-990-210-701; 013-613-556-484-463; 014-126-240-704-309; 016-484-548-630-441; 018-204-723-944-792; 026-896-525-188-922; 030-681-341-991-67X; 033-513-674-858-857; 035-552-854-344-591; 036-130-488-246-022; 036-516-744-598-046; 038-174-069-555-530; 040-736-978-220-90X; 042-290-330-546-594; 042-339-551-853-939; 042-912-384-577-015; 046-067-978-341-931; 054-667-985-548-323; 061-069-424-731-332; 065-130-450-554-881; 065-925-577-699-702; 073-755-160-792-718; 075-716-665-956-264; 076-405-188-820-687; 081-171-589-617-497; 082-207-555-052-254; 086-109-184-153-334; 088-792-537-006-631; 091-549-690-198-885; 105-050-768-989-884; 109-772-812-845-985; 113-452-981-053-630; 115-864-547-345-394; 117-794-985-965-034; 120-014-440-699-096; 123-368-383-289-134; 126-270-293-682-083; 144-451-314-239-95X; 162-701-588-027-577; 163-858-790-814-349; 164-463-643-472-537; 181-888-483-146-862; 191-392-252-671-41X,9,true,cc-by,hybrid

Zhang,"We consider the problem of ranking $n$ players from partial pairwise comparison data under the Bradley-Terry-Luce model. For the first time in the literature, the minimax rate of this ranking problem is derived with respect to the Kendall's tau distance that measures the difference between two rank vectors by counting the number of inversions. The minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition between an exponential rate and a polynomial rate depending on the magnitude of the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is unique to full ranking and has not been seen in any other statistical estimation problem. To achieve the minimax rate, we propose a divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm that first divides the $n$ players into groups of similar skills and then computes local MLE within each group. The optimality of the proposed algorithm is established by a careful approximate independence argument between the two steps.",,,,,Minimax; Ranking (information retrieval); Pairwise comparison; Mathematics; Rank (graph theory); Independence (probability theory); Ranking SVM; Statistics; Mathematical optimization; Combinatorics; Computer science; Artificial intelligence,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08421,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2101.08421,,10.48550/arxiv.2101.08421,,,0,,0,true,,green

The two fuzzy C-Medoids clustering methods, based on the same suitable exponential transformation of the Kemeny distance, belong to two different approaches and differ in the way they introduce the fuzziness in the membership matrix, the one based on the “m” exponent and the other on the Shannon entropy.

While several studies in the literature have attempted to empirically test how accurately a BTL model can model some given pairwise comparison data, this work aims to develop a formal, computationally efficient hypothesis test to determine whether the BTL model accurately represents the data. Specifically, we first propose such a formal hypothesis test, establish an upper bound on the critical radius of the proposed test, and then provide a complementary lower bound on the critical radius. Our bounds prove the minimax optimality of the scaling of the critical radius with respect to the number of items (up to constant factors). Finally, we also take the first step towards characterizing the stability of rankings under the BTL model when there is a small model mismatch.",,,,,Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Upper and lower bounds; Ranking (information retrieval); Computer science; RADIUS; Set (abstract data type); Constant (computer programming); Scaling; Stability (learning theory); Mathematics; Test (biology); Algorithm; Theoretical computer science; Artificial intelligence; Mathematical optimization; Machine learning; Mathematical analysis; Paleontology; Geometry; Computer security; Biology; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isit54713.2023.10206450,,10.1109/isit54713.2023.10206450,,,0,000-499-627-908-756; 010-816-693-386-190; 022-501-390-008-829; 025-823-314-410-825; 029-712-119-607-36X; 031-830-169-787-740; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-829-579-281-766; 043-325-494-014-838; 047-307-839-107-965; 058-310-338-398-932; 070-331-031-103-877; 079-367-665-908-927; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 105-197-803-566-972; 109-872-275-977-891; 120-424-874-837-080; 125-667-490-657-695,0,false,,

The audio stimuli are meticulous reconstructions of drum patterns found in commercial recordings; they are based on careful transcriptions (carried out by professional musicians), drum stroke loudness information, and highly precise onset timing measurements. The 40 stimuli are a subset selected from a previously published larger corpus of reconstructed Western popular music drum patterns (Lucerne Groove Research Library). The patterns were selected according to two criteria: a) they only feature the bass drum, snare drum, and one or more cymbals, and b) they plausibly cover the complexity range of the corpus. Perceived stimulus complexity was measured in a listening experiment using a pairwise comparison design with 220 participants (4,400 trials). In each trial, participants were presented with two stimuli, and they stated which of the two sounded more complex to them. The comparison data then served to calculate complexity estimates using the Bradley–Terry probability model. The complexity estimates have an intuitive interpretation: they allow calculation of the probability that one pattern is considered more complex than another pattern in a pairwise comparison. To our knowledge, this is the first set of naturalistic music stimuli with meaningful perceived complexity estimates. The drum pattern stimuli and complexity measurements can be used for listening experiments in music psychology. The stimuli will further allow measures and models of drum pattern complexity to be assessed. </jats:p>",6,,,,Stimulus (psychology); Loudness; Perception; Active listening; Speech recognition; Music information retrieval; Drum; Computer science; Psychology; Pairwise comparison; Cognitive psychology; Communication; Artificial intelligence; Computer vision; Mechanical engineering; Musical; Art; Neuroscience; Engineering; Visual arts,,,,Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/20592043231202576 https://doi.org/10.1177/20592043231202576,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/20592043231202576,,10.1177/20592043231202576,,,0,001-059-592-904-33X; 002-546-692-211-500; 003-343-346-254-125; 005-889-043-314-618; 008-928-248-137-086; 010-531-153-119-797; 014-355-722-355-77X; 016-239-213-871-375; 017-049-196-657-412; 017-169-478-586-479; 017-384-508-044-606; 024-407-195-287-588; 024-821-932-787-595; 026-766-965-560-77X; 027-289-980-545-479; 027-696-067-046-483; 031-830-169-787-740; 032-377-730-749-752; 033-687-040-842-108; 033-924-394-013-397; 034-374-379-157-045; 035-013-666-267-506; 035-176-457-206-631; 035-759-981-987-395; 038-403-029-139-328; 038-858-881-186-93X; 038-968-463-469-977; 039-139-222-104-510; 039-676-632-397-727; 039-859-460-502-982; 039-944-331-849-636; 046-220-205-396-437; 048-437-563-585-350; 049-459-007-232-742; 052-449-756-097-284; 056-387-283-021-021; 057-138-830-768-343; 062-974-733-792-08X; 068-304-165-730-184; 069-068-190-023-662; 072-636-289-362-809; 074-272-464-968-284; 075-323-052-789-726; 077-283-088-386-688; 077-337-403-045-80X; 079-854-256-187-901; 082-276-252-204-010; 082-657-515-340-970; 087-294-974-881-487; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-463-345-268-812; 089-659-171-988-186; 098-675-114-539-161; 104-210-305-478-010; 108-374-899-041-743; 111-190-584-960-560; 121-218-646-961-230; 121-690-817-955-88X; 122-316-531-493-866; 123-732-314-614-739; 129-075-902-010-211; 133-251-584-147-89X; 134-573-215-195-19X; 135-544-565-712-189; 141-524-269-121-084; 151-958-003-312-693; 157-705-653-746-365; 165-891-606-226-756; 172-588-205-757-566; 184-794-688-390-932; 191-583-133-628-963,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC",gold

We focus on the models that allow three options for choice and the parameters are estimated by maximum likelihood method. The existence and uniqueness of the estimator are key issues of the evaluation. In the case of two options, a necessary and sufficient condition is given by Ford in the Bradley–Terry model. We generalize this statement for the set of strictly log-concave distribution. Although in the case of three options the necessary and sufficient condition is not known, there are two different sufficient conditions that are formulated in the literature. In this paper, we generalize them; moreover, we compare these conditions. Their capacities to indicate the existence of the maximum were analyzed using a large number of computer simulations. These simulations support that the new condition indicates the existence of the maximum much more frequently than the previously known ones.</jats:p>",12,6,575,575,Uniqueness; Statement (logic); Estimator; Mathematics; Applied mathematics; Maximum likelihood; Focus (optics); Set (abstract data type); Estimation theory; Mathematical optimization; Distribution (mathematics); Problem statement; Mathematical economics; Statistics; Computer science; Mathematical analysis; Economics; Physics; Optics; Political science; Law; Programming language; Management science,,,,,https://www.mdpi.com/2075-1680/12/6/575/pdf?version=1686295850 https://doi.org/10.3390/axioms12060575,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/axioms12060575,,10.3390/axioms12060575,,,0,000-064-088-863-321; 005-932-334-805-223; 008-407-348-654-386; 009-743-097-643-728; 009-881-393-198-900; 013-022-807-995-803; 013-964-107-618-600; 016-879-467-579-230; 018-923-991-014-963; 025-009-658-071-875; 027-150-047-044-961; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-074-758-302-554; 037-897-426-001-855; 039-602-767-986-164; 045-187-870-348-998; 048-024-663-664-413; 048-150-458-237-508; 054-990-464-566-18X; 055-968-595-299-240; 061-333-639-971-165; 069-959-182-388-927; 080-519-206-174-181; 084-604-282-276-456; 086-196-137-396-761; 093-629-899-561-975; 093-784-935-819-145; 112-298-685-672-745; 117-341-991-234-105; 124-850-148-955-311; 129-052-096-182-374; 143-010-088-741-318; 156-916-640-904-903,0,true,cc-by,gold

Bartholomew; Matthew D. Jones; Steven Hawkins; Jeff Orton,"Traditional Accounting curricula include instruction on the preparation of audit documentation, however, experiential instruction for students on the process of review-both as a reviewer and reviewee-is often scarce or missing. This study investigated a classroom intervention that engaged undergraduate students in peer-review activities to gauge how peer review and feedback impacted student performance and their perceptions of being able to engage in interpersonal risks. Using a case-method approach, students developed audit workpapers that were later peer-reviewed through a digital system utilizing adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ). Students’ achievement scores were collected, and students also completed a pre/post survey on psychological safety. Our results indicate that student psychological safety increased over the course of the semester; however, the peer review process through ACJ did not significantly improve student performance within the class. The students responded positively to the intervention as an engaging learning process and effective in teaching real-world skills. Thus, this intervention provides an example of how peer review activities could enhance the learning experience for students.",9,1,1,31,Peer review; Psychology; Interpersonal communication; Audit; Intervention (counseling); Psychological safety; Experiential learning; Curriculum; Medical education; Documentation,,,,,https://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jet/article/view/19046 https://www.macrothink.org/journal/index.php/jet/article/download/19046/14878,http://dx.doi.org/10.5296/jet.v9i1.19046,,10.5296/jet.v9i1.19046,3208392095,,0,,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

The context is distinct from other applications of comparative judgement as there is no need to create a new achievement scale using a Bradley-Terry model (or similar). The proposed method takes advantage of this fact to include evidence from the largest possible number of examples of students’ performances on the separate assessments whilst keeping the amount of time required from expert judges as low as possible. The paper describes the method and shows, via simulation, how it achieves greater accuracy than alternative approaches to the use of comparative judgement for test equating or linking.</jats:p>",6,,,,Judgement; Equating; Context (archaeology); Computer science; Task (project management); Test (biology); Scale (ratio); Artificial intelligence; Machine learning; Statistics; Mathematics; Rasch model; Engineering; Epistemology; Geography; Systems engineering; Paleontology; Philosophy; Cartography; Archaeology; Biology,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.775203/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.775203,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.775203,,10.3389/feduc.2021.775203,,,0,017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-886-709-886-069; 038-429-789-443-678; 048-091-210-665-560; 066-718-263-808-78X; 081-370-959-105-221; 113-736-958-212-757; 148-673-033-661-432,2,true,cc-by,gold

The speed, intensity, and contact area of the strokes should be systematically changed to evaluate the relationship between pleasantness and tactile stimuli in more detail. Studies have examined the relationship between stroking stimulation and pleasant sensations using airborne ultrasound tactile displays. The ultrasound-based method has the advantage of reproducible control of the speed, intensity, and contact area of the stimulus. In this study, we prepared new stimuli focusing on the modulation methods and the contact area and aimed to clarify their relationship with pleasantness in more detail. Evaluating subjective sensations, such as pleasantness, numerically and consistently is challenging, warranting evaluation based on comparison. We propose a stimulus evaluation method that combines rough evaluation using Likert scales, detailed evaluation using pairwise comparisons, and quantification of comparison data using the Bradley--Terry model. As a result, we confirmed that the stimulus using lateral modulation and that with a large contact area used in this study were more pleasant than the conventional stimulus for six out of ten participants.",,,,,Stimulus (psychology); Sensation; Psychology; Audiology; Cognitive psychology; Medicine,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.09412,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2305.09412,,10.48550/arxiv.2305.09412,,,0,,0,true,,green
095-895-288-503-48X,A Spectral Approach for the Dynamic Bradley-Terry Model,2023-07-31,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Xin-Yu Tian; Jian Shi; Xiaotong Shen; Kai Song,"The dynamic ranking, due to its increasing importance in many applications, is becoming crucial, especially with the collection of voluminous time-dependent data. One such application is sports statistics, where dynamic ranking aids in forecasting the performance of competitive teams, drawing on historical and current data. Despite its usefulness, predicting and inferring rankings pose challenges in environments necessitating time-dependent modeling. This paper introduces a spectral ranker called Kernel Rank Centrality, designed to rank items based on pairwise comparisons over time. The ranker operates via kernel smoothing in the Bradley-Terry model, utilizing a Markov chain model. Unlike the maximum likelihood approach, the spectral ranker is nonparametric, demands fewer model assumptions and computations, and allows for real-time ranking. We establish the asymptotic distribution of the ranker by applying an innovative group inverse technique, resulting in a uniform and precise entrywise expansion. This result allows us to devise a new inferential method for predictive inference, previously unavailable in existing approaches. Our numerical examples showcase the ranker's utility in predictive accuracy and constructing an uncertainty measure for prediction, leveraging data from the National Basketball Association (NBA). The results underscore our method's potential compared to the gold standard in sports, the Arpad Elo rating system.",,,,,Computer science; Ranking (information retrieval); Inference; Pairwise comparison; Nonparametric statistics; Kernel (algebra); Data mining; Machine learning; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Smoothing; Rank (graph theory); Artificial intelligence; Econometrics; Mathematics; Bayesian probability; Combinatorics; Computer vision,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16642,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.16642,,10.48550/arxiv.2307.16642,,,0,,0,true,,green

A great deal of attention has been paid to improving the usability of these ceremonies over the last two decades, to make them easier for end-users to engage with. Yet, usability improvements do not seem to have endeared end users to ceremonies. As a consequence, human actors might subvert the ceremony’s processes or avoid engaging with it. Here, we consider whether<jats:italic>beautification</jats:italic>could be one way of making ceremonies more appealing. To explore beautification in this context, we carried out three studies. Study 1 surveyed 250 participants to derive a wide range of potential dimensions of “beautiful ceremonies”. These statements were sorted into dominant themes and converted into statements, which fed into the second study, with 309 respondents, to reveal the<jats:italic>dominant</jats:italic>dimensions constituting beauty. Study 3 asked 41 participants to carry out a Q-sort, which revealed the ways that people<jats:italic>combine</jats:italic>the identified dimensions when characterising security ceremonies as “beautiful”. These studies have allowed us to pin down the perceived dimensions of beauty in the context of security ceremonies, and also to understand how people combine these dimensions in different ways in judging security ceremonies to be beautiful, confirming the old adage of beauty being “in the eye of the beholder”. We conclude by highlighting the constraints imposed by the overarching requirement for security to be maintained in the face of any usability improvements and beautification endeavours.</jats:p>",35,3,,,Beauty; Beautification; Context (archaeology); Usability; Aesthetics; Perception; Internet privacy; Sociology; Computer science; Art; Epistemology; Human–computer interaction; Engineering; History; Philosophy; Civil engineering; Archaeology,,,,Università degli Studi di Catania,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13347-022-00552-0.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s13347-022-00552-0 https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/files/43698977/Ophoff_PerceptionsofBeauty_Published_2022.pdf https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/en/publications/de2aafda-806e-4e3c-bbb4-92a5246a385e https://rke.abertay.ac.uk/ws/files/43698977/Ophoff_PerceptionsofBeauty_Published_2022.pdf https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/81141/13/Bella_etal_PT_2022_Perceptions_of_beauty_in_security_ceremonies.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13347-022-00552-0,,10.1007/s13347-022-00552-0,,,0,001-103-591-606-31X; 001-232-346-889-935; 003-622-626-628-226; 004-212-235-882-766; 005-278-697-743-566; 005-591-969-394-699; 006-239-163-582-715; 011-288-917-602-834; 013-685-021-497-383; 015-023-925-812-016; 020-704-566-496-174; 020-931-678-738-756; 021-135-620-203-715; 021-270-799-148-614; 026-426-106-254-255; 026-562-261-072-60X; 029-363-963-631-362; 030-175-497-836-156; 032-727-642-442-563; 032-997-357-904-44X; 039-960-833-229-832; 043-954-554-388-762; 044-613-125-596-206; 047-431-613-953-331; 050-292-840-543-325; 051-199-025-526-131; 051-250-293-930-748; 053-536-234-683-35X; 061-619-582-445-933; 067-196-288-475-88X; 067-550-356-736-033; 070-495-531-577-826; 074-810-553-080-32X; 076-837-974-330-393; 080-172-623-948-002; 086-349-218-767-67X; 100-526-163-433-348; 103-997-114-647-454; 106-031-198-491-20X; 106-484-868-965-067; 109-315-750-510-085; 110-181-134-916-211; 113-546-139-690-504; 124-504-121-136-023; 126-276-276-446-22X; 146-844-810-985-038; 147-778-814-935-955; 150-806-858-330-927; 151-064-943-000-611; 179-766-763-660-244,3,true,cc-by,hybrid

Pairwise comparisons can be performed within several frameworks such as multiplicative, additive and fuzzy representations of preferences, which are particular instances of a more general framework based on Abelian linearly ordered groups. Though multiplicative, additive and fuzzy representations of preferences are widely used in practice, it is unknown whether decision makers are equally precise in the three aforementioned representations when they measure objective data. Therefore, the aim of this paper is to design, carry out and analyse an experiment with over 200 respondents (undergraduate university students) from two countries, Czechia and Italy, to compare precision of the respondents in all three representations. In the experiment, respondents pairwise compared (by approximation) the areas of four geometric figures and then, the imprecision of their assessments was measured by computing the distance with the exact pairwise comparisons. We grouped the respondents in such a way that each participant was allowed to deal with a unique type of representation. The outcomes of the experiment indicate that the multiplicative approach is the most precise.</jats:p>",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Multiplicative function; Analytic hierarchy process; Representation (politics); Mathematics; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Operations research; Mathematical analysis; Politics; Political science; Law,,,,Grantová Agentura České Republiky; Grantová Agentura České Republiky; Università degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10700-023-09416-4.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10700-023-09416-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10700-023-09416-4,,10.1007/s10700-023-09416-4,,,0,009-422-796-746-18X; 009-858-645-853-938; 009-881-393-198-900; 014-868-673-390-475; 019-062-016-741-73X; 034-298-311-251-930; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-962-178-059-67X; 039-848-149-210-078; 040-265-687-457-255; 048-291-955-168-581; 054-219-490-889-557; 071-682-666-168-026; 090-540-599-882-937; 103-794-995-087-011; 116-354-869-619-390; 127-884-798-472-99X; 131-534-939-994-674; 185-299-152-267-619,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Advocates claim two main rationales for its use: that comparative judgment is valid because humans are better at comparative than absolute judgment, and because it distils the aggregate view of expert judges. We explore these contentions. We argue that the psychological underpinnings used to justify the method are superficially treated in the literature. We conceptualise and critique the notion that comparative judgment is ‘intrinsically valid’ due to its use of expert judges.

One of the main advantages of a comparative format is that it can reduce faking of responses in high-stakes situations. However, previous research has shown that it is highly difficult to obtain trait score estimates that are both faking resistant and sufficiently accurate for individual-level diagnostic decisions. With the goal of contributing to a solution, I study the information obtainable from comparative judgments analyzed by means of Thurstonian IRT models. First, I extend the mathematical theory of ordinal comparative judgments and corresponding models. Second, I provide optimal test designs for Thurstonian IRT models that maximize the accuracy of people's trait score estimates from both frequentist and Bayesian statistical perspectives. Third, I derive analytic upper bounds for the accuracy of these trait estimates achievable through ordinal Thurstonian IRT models. Fourth, I perform numerical experiments that complement results obtained in earlier simulation studies. The combined analytical and numerical results suggest that it is indeed possible to design personality tests using comparative judgments that yield trait scores estimates sufficiently accurate for individual-level diagnostic decisions, while reducing faking in high-stakes situations.

Schimek; Luca Vitale; Bastian Pfeifer; Michele La Rocca,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>The ranking of objects is widely used to rate their relative quality or relevance across multiple assessments. Beyond classical rank aggregation, it is of interest to estimate the usually unobservable latent signals that inform a consensus ranking. Under the only assumption of independent assessments, which can be incomplete, we introduce indirect inference via convex optimization in combination with computationally efficient Poisson Bootstrap. Two different objective functions are suggested, one linear and the other quadratic. The mathematical formulation of the signal estimation problem is based on pairwise comparisons of all objects with respect to their rank positions. Sets of constraints represent the order relations. The transitivity property of rank scales allows us to reduce substantially the number of constraints associated with the full set of object comparisons. The key idea is to globally reduce the errors induced by the rankers until optimal latent signals can be obtained.

In this judgement process, assessors are presented with two pieces of student work and are asked to choose which one is better in relation to the competencies being assessed. However, since student work is heterogeneous and highly information loaded, it raises the question as to whether this type of assessment is too complex for assessors to use. Previous research on the topic has operationalized experienced complexity by employing self-report measures, which have been criticized for common problems associated with their use. In our study, we used eye tracking to study 23 high school teachers when they made 10 comparative judgments, and their pupil diameter was used as an indicator of the experienced complexity. This study builds on previous research that integrated Campbell’s theory on task complexity (1988) into CJ. Based on this framework, three hypotheses regarding the role of decision accuracy were formulated and empirically tested. Hypothesis one assumes that the distance between two pieces of student work on the rank-order (rank-order distance) is negatively related to experienced complexity, irrespective of decision accuracy. Hypothesis two assumes that decision accuracy moderates the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Hypothesis three builds on hypothesis two by adding a negative relationship between experience and experienced complexity. In all three hypotheses, the average experienced complexity is assumed to vary between assessors, as is the strength of the expected relationships. An information-theoretic approach was used to test the holding of all three hypotheses. All hypotheses were translated into statistical models, and their relative and absolute fit were assessed. Results provided strong evidence for hypothesis three: both the moderating role of decision accuracy on the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity, and the relationship between experience and experienced complexity, were confirmed.",5,,,,Statistical model; Psychology; Negative relationship; Cognitive psychology; Judgement; Test (assessment); Task (project management); Argumentative; Eye tracking; Operationalization,,,,Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.582800/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2020.582800,,10.3389/feduc.2020.582800,3128062472,,0,005-409-689-895-137; 006-697-130-958-147; 007-386-871-650-113; 008-515-844-318-494; 011-261-050-123-936; 014-854-010-836-643; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-294-984-590-568; 024-205-010-922-309; 024-852-157-524-365; 030-068-616-885-927; 030-442-137-998-032; 032-709-967-155-328; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-980-996-015-137; 040-241-846-826-833; 044-962-236-204-557; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 054-800-256-766-777; 064-467-288-573-407; 066-908-670-161-319; 073-572-324-447-872; 079-266-564-904-30X; 079-837-323-682-087; 081-952-102-948-393; 085-408-776-824-254; 090-708-179-854-194; 095-590-706-989-383; 097-113-961-809-678; 101-848-247-761-283; 102-955-514-174-383; 105-060-972-080-52X; 105-761-216-852-813; 107-790-959-417-375; 117-610-732-777-853; 121-161-560-636-803; 126-454-221-798-016; 148-673-033-661-432; 151-139-760-758-941; 167-275-555-617-549; 173-829-995-279-749,0,true,cc-by,gold

This paper explores a quite different method of assessment using ‘Adaptive Comparative Judgement’ (ACJ) that was developed within a research project at Goldsmiths University of London between 2004 and 2010. The method was developed into a tool that enabled judges to distinguish better/worse performances not by allocating numbers through mark schemes, but rather by direct, holistic, judgement. The tool was successfully deployed through a series of national and international research and development exercises. But game-changing innovations are never flaw-less first time out (Golley, Jet: Frank Whittle and the Invention of the Jet Engine, Datum Publishing, Liphook Hampshire, 2009; Dyson, Against the odds: an autobiography, Texere Publishing, Knutsford Cheshire, 2001) and a series of careful investigations resulted in a problem being identified within the workings of ACJ (Bramley, Investigating the reliability of Adaptive Comparative Judgment, Cambridge Assessment Research Report, UK, Cambridge, 2015). The issue was with the ‘adaptive’ component of the algorithm that, under certain conditions, appeared to exaggerate the reliability statistic. The problem was ‘worked’ by the software company running ACJ and a solution found. This paper reports the whole sequence of events—from the original innovation, through deployment, the emergent problem, and the resulting solution that was published at an international conference (Rangel Smith and Lynch in: PATT36 International Conference. Research & Practice in Technology Education: Perspectives on Human Capacity and Development, 2018) and subsequently deployed within a modified ACJ algorithm.",,,1,15,Engineering management; Publishing; Educational technology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Quality (business); Computer science; Science education; Reliability (statistics); Technology education,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,,,3131726837,,0,003-019-903-218-043; 006-719-044-652-648; 007-775-768-494-369; 012-145-631-812-551; 012-962-168-631-344; 015-035-210-409-280; 022-886-709-886-069; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 055-875-865-161-135; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 074-813-203-051-83X; 075-548-610-945-867; 083-130-316-203-709; 091-465-380-379-025; 106-681-332-176-644; 108-462-313-507-607; 119-113-819-818-430; 126-875-389-752-711; 133-529-167-198-85X; 149-208-961-050-864; 160-928-885-215-092; 169-132-973-382-548,0,false,,

  Comparison Graphs",2021-10-20,2021,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Wanshan Li; Shamindra Shrotriya; Alessandro Rinaldo,"The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a popular statistical approach for estimating the global ranking of a collection of items using pairwise comparisons. To ensure accurate ranking, it is essential to obtain precise estimates of the model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty of this task depends crucially on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph over the given items. However, beyond very few well-studied cases, such as the complete and Erd\""os-R\'enyi comparison graphs, little is known about the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator MLE) of the BTL model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general graph topologies. In this paper, we derive novel, general upper bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error of the BTL MLE that depend explicitly on the algebraic connectivity of the comparison graph, the maximal performance gap across items and the sample complexity. We demonstrate that the derived bounds perform well and in some cases are sharper compared to known results obtained using different loss functions and more restricted assumptions and graph topologies. We carefully compare our results to Yan et al. (2012), which is closest in spirit to our work. We further provide minimax lower bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$-error that nearly match the upper bounds over a class of sufficiently regular graph topologies. Finally, we study the implications of our $\ell_{\infty}$-bounds for efficient (offline) tournament design. We illustrate and discuss our findings through various examples and simulations.",,,,,Mathematics; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Network topology; Minimax; Upper and lower bounds; Graph; Combinatorics; Discrete mathematics; Mathematical optimization; Statistics; Computer science; Mathematical analysis; Operating system,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.10825,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2110.10825,,10.48550/arxiv.2110.10825,,,0,,0,true,,green

Testing the congruence between using Likert scale and comparative judgment on measuring attribution,,2021,journal article,Methods in Psychology,25902601,Elsevier BV,,Che Cheng; Keng-Ling Lay; Yung-Fong Hsu; Yi-Miau Tsai,"Abstract How people make choices among alternatives are of interest in different areas of psychological research. One paradigm to answer this question is by applying Likert Scale (LS) to compare the agreements to different alternatives, and the respective LS scores are then transferred into rank order of preference. However, using LS to infer choices is somewhat debatable because the measurement format of LS was not designed for revealing psychological preference. In this article, we examined to what extent it is appropriate to use quantitative indicators derived from LS to infer choices, with which we used the Comparative Judgment (CJ) procedure to represent a direct measurement of choice decision to compare. A total of 929 adolescents reported their effort and ability attributions for academic failure and success using both LS and CJ. We found that while using LS is generally accurate in predicting results obtained via CJ, the percentage of people revealing different choices inferred from LS versus CJ was 14.7% and 12.1% for the success and failure scenarios, respectively, suggesting that inferring psychological preference from LS is not without risk, at least for this sample of adolescents from a culturally-Chinese society. Furthermore, the majority of participants displaying incongruent decisions of achievement attribution via LS and CJ showed equivalent LS scores between effort and ability attributions. A goodness-of-fit test was conducted (on a model motivated by the beta-binomial distribution) and successfully eliminated the possibility that the tied LS scores in effort and ability attributions actually represent participants’ true psychological state.",5,,100081,,Likert scale; Congruence (geometry); Attribution; Psychology; Psychological research; Test (assessment); Preference; Sample (statistics); Social psychology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590260121000382,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metip.2021.100081,,10.1016/j.metip.2021.100081,3210175506,,0,001-129-564-773-548; 003-111-035-592-589; 003-201-157-311-828; 005-717-594-955-613; 006-880-103-099-91X; 007-935-644-647-44X; 008-400-306-798-435; 012-711-607-971-687; 019-460-117-250-984; 021-297-566-152-831; 021-553-618-349-40X; 026-576-630-650-24X; 028-255-043-801-758; 032-348-734-542-617; 033-666-666-058-304; 035-497-875-132-361; 037-449-106-710-901; 043-649-646-500-888; 049-215-037-752-633; 050-209-265-352-054; 055-777-499-511-123; 060-248-627-613-421; 062-171-526-167-776; 065-556-929-551-680; 067-159-835-632-184; 069-637-371-771-202; 071-785-176-482-436; 073-171-934-587-058; 073-941-283-869-155; 075-051-498-530-106; 075-452-781-388-114; 077-278-968-159-751; 078-820-425-261-614; 078-850-946-708-431; 079-085-960-423-222; 079-211-300-962-663; 079-670-358-726-236; 079-879-145-117-629; 085-178-175-080-703; 086-910-283-922-542; 088-315-591-059-660; 093-181-902-558-281; 095-848-697-970-554; 096-342-956-887-535; 106-793-010-222-472; 109-316-119-853-662; 113-877-535-854-589; 116-275-534-296-096; 121-161-560-636-803; 128-609-080-705-176; 129-681-729-979-79X; 136-393-909-828-400; 142-767-117-977-994; 149-733-656-155-702; 150-325-162-873-23X; 152-081-927-548-530; 172-031-502-220-564; 172-572-166-912-802; 193-657-345-235-442,8,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Several response biases, such as social desirability, response styles, and acquiescence bias, can be reduced effectively. Another type of data linked with comparative judgments is response time (RT), which contains potential information concerning respondents’ decision-making process. It would be challenging but exciting to combine RT into FC measures better to reveal respondents’ behaviors or preferences in personality measurement. Given this situation, this study aims to propose a new item response theory (IRT) model that incorporates RT into FC measures to improve personality assessment. Simulation studies show that the proposed model can effectively improve the estimation accuracy of personality traits with the ancillary information contained in RT. Also, an application on a real data set reveals that the proposed model estimates similar but different parameter values compared with the conventional Thurstonian IRT model. The RT information can explain these differences. </jats:p>",,,1316442311711,001316442311711,Acquiescence; Item response theory; Two-alternative forced choice; Personality; Psychology; Response bias; Response time; Set (abstract data type); Econometrics; Social psychology; Big Five personality traits; Process (computing); Statistics; Cognitive psychology; Psychometrics; Computer science; Mathematics; Developmental psychology; Computer graphics (images); Operating system; Politics; Political science; Law; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/00131644231171193,,10.1177/00131644231171193,,,0,004-414-436-917-174; 005-768-971-676-186; 005-944-986-860-875; 006-123-837-168-912; 010-772-077-959-774; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-605-981-755-950; 012-627-916-329-389; 015-873-195-036-780; 020-366-670-021-807; 020-724-054-475-140; 024-083-248-087-208; 027-077-649-916-714; 028-774-541-626-301; 030-684-277-640-990; 031-274-112-313-881; 031-995-315-395-784; 034-354-686-022-900; 036-191-057-241-237; 037-498-068-085-359; 037-877-702-542-183; 041-500-876-109-835; 045-451-119-149-01X; 045-951-366-162-706; 050-650-330-459-956; 050-701-869-637-24X; 050-765-251-319-680; 053-281-518-543-066; 054-147-697-317-249; 057-680-486-150-543; 057-890-091-149-80X; 057-969-051-328-995; 063-680-848-225-424; 065-130-290-645-468; 066-885-945-696-971; 067-001-342-235-404; 072-493-180-637-447; 075-351-893-316-286; 077-008-140-644-394; 079-646-550-056-48X; 083-324-271-244-43X; 083-909-668-659-282; 086-507-154-835-004; 094-570-221-734-775; 095-498-164-090-573; 096-558-601-945-495; 098-216-417-129-861; 100-994-823-787-801; 102-693-982-590-25X; 108-831-924-899-305; 111-418-142-219-167; 111-685-276-532-817; 113-522-904-549-801; 115-583-498-567-968; 118-382-209-755-996; 124-670-803-980-903; 126-471-294-714-631; 129-321-730-358-545; 134-972-367-087-727; 158-077-205-960-976; 158-892-565-589-913; 158-967-721-970-817,1,false,,

104-067-604-763-242,Judgments in causal chains: The impact of positive and negative motives and outcomes on lay attributions,2021-11-14,2021,dissertation,,,Victoria University of Wellington Library,,Briar Helen Moir,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Research on attributions about several events in causal chains has focused on chains ending in negative outcomes and has not examined positive outcomes and actions (e.g., Hilton, McClure, &amp; Sutton, 2010; Lagnado &amp; Channon, 2008; McClure, Hilton, &amp; Sutton, 2007). On the other hand, research on attributions for positive and negative events has examined judgments about one event in the chain and has not examined effects on other causes in the chain or made comparative judgments about physical causes that produce similar effects to actions (e.g., Alicke, 1992; Alicke, Rose, &amp; Bloom, 2011). This thesis integrates these two lines of research. Six studies examined judgments about two consecutive events (intentional actions and physical events) in chains leading to positive as well as negative outcomes. The intentional action was the same action (e.g. a man started a fire) that differed in motive (positive or negative). The physical event had the same causal effect as the action (e.g., a lightning strike started a fire), or was a physical event (e.g., strong wind) that occurred later in the causal chain.  The results replicate previous findings that when both actions and outcomes are negative, participants rate intentional actions more causal and blameworthy than physical events. However, when the intended outcomes fail to eventuate or positively motivated actions pre-empt positive outcomes, two distinct patterns emerged: A mismatch effect that explains the cause of the outcome; and a motive effect that explains judgments of culpability (measured by judgments of blame and punitiveness in these studies). Specifically, judgments of cause, responsibility, intentionality and foresight follow the same pattern that reflects the congruence between the valence of the agent‟s motive and the outcome. In contrast, judgments of culpability follow a different pattern where motive and outcome information have independent effects. Notably, it is the moral intent of actions that primarily determines judgments of culpability. The valence of the outcome plays a secondary role and amplifies ratings.  These results show that the important psychological and legal concepts of intentionality, abnormality, foresight, proximity, and outcome information are core determinants in lay attributions (e.g., Hart &amp; Honoré, 1985; Heider, 1958; Kelley, 1973; Weiner, 1995). But it is valence that plays the critical role in shaping lay reasoning. Several theoretical approaches applied in previous research on causal chains are examined, for example, Alicke's (2000) culpable control model, Tetlock's (2002) social functionalist model, and Spellman's (1997) crediting causality model. Yet none of the theories are able to account for the findings for chains that include positive actions or positive outcomes. The theoretical scope of this thesis was expanded in Study 6 to include research on the folk concept of intentionality, hindsight, and actor-observer biases (Fischhoff, 1975; Kashima, McKintyre, &amp; Clifford, 1998; Malle &amp; Knobe, 1997; Malle, Knobe, &amp; Nelson, 2007). The results are interpreted in terms of Sloman, Fernbach and Ewings' (2012) causal model of intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Attribution; Blame; Psychology; Causal chain; Social psychology; Action (physics); Event (particle physics); Outcome (game theory); Economics; Philosophy; Physics; Mathematical economics; Epistemology; Quantum mechanics,,,,,https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566/1/files/31459861.pdf https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17006566.v1 https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566/1/files/31459861.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566,http://dx.doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17006566.v1,,10.26686/wgtn.17006566.v1,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

An assumption made in using this method is that there are equal intervals between global ratings (GR) (e.g. Fail, Borderline Pass, Clear Pass, Good and Excellent). However, this assumption has never been tested in the medical literature to the best of our knowledge. We examine if the assumption of equal intervals between GR is met, and the potential implications for student outcomes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">Clinical finals examiners were recruited across two institutions to place the typical 'Borderline Pass', 'Clear Pass' and 'Good' candidate on a continuous slider scale between a typical 'Fail' candidate at point 0 and a typical 'Excellent' candidate at point 1. Results were analysed using one-sample t-testing of each interval to an equal interval size of 0.25. Secondary data analysis was performed on summative assessment scores for 94 clinical stations and 1191 medical student examination outcomes in the final 2 years of study at a single centre.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">On a scale from 0.00 (Fail) to 1.00 (Excellent), mean examiner GRs for 'Borderline Pass', 'Clear Pass' and 'Good' were 0.33, 0.55 and 0.77 respectively. All of the four intervals between GRs (Fail-Borderline Pass, Borderline Pass-Clear Pass, Clear Pass-Good, Good-Excellent) were statistically significantly different to the expected value of 0.25 (all p-values &lt; 0.0125). An ordinal linear regression using mean examiner GRs was performed for each of the 94 stations, to determine pass marks out of 24. This increased pass marks for all 94 stations compared with the original GR locations (mean increase 0.21), and caused one additional fail by overall exam pass mark (out of 1191 students) and 92 additional station fails (out of 11,346 stations).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSIONS"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Although the current assumption of equal intervals between GRs across the performance spectrum is not met, and an adjusted regression equation causes an increase in station pass marks, the effect on overall exam pass/fail outcomes is modest.</AbstractText>;           <CopyrightInformation>© 2022.

This paper is concerned with the problem of ranking and grouping from pairwise comparisons simultaneously so that items with similar abilities are clustered into the same group. To achieve this, a penalised spectral ranking method, named as grouped rank centrality, is designed. In the method, the fused lasso estimator is used in conjunction with a spectral‐based method, rank centrality. We reconstruct and simplify the original problem to a concise structure which has the same form with the linear adaptive lasso problem. The ability score estimation is finally obtained by applying the refitting strategy based on the group structure identified by the grouped rank centrality. Theoretical results are provided to present the grouping consistent property and asymptotic normality of the estimator under the Bradley–Terry assumption. The simulation study and real examples including National Basketball Association (NBA) data and journal meta‐rankings are provided to demonstrate the validity of our theory and the practical significance of the proposed approach.</jats:p>",12,1,,,Pairwise comparison; Ranking (information retrieval); Centrality; Rank (graph theory); Estimator; Artificial intelligence; Mathematics; Interpretation (philosophy); Computer science; Statistics; Machine learning; Pattern recognition (psychology); Data mining; Combinatorics; Programming language,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/sta4.626,,10.1002/sta4.626,,,0,001-821-022-385-875; 001-989-717-959-854; 007-512-146-614-819; 010-916-070-573-553; 014-306-684-095-899; 015-893-359-960-186; 018-272-703-468-738; 022-501-390-008-829; 022-628-699-660-469; 024-810-885-819-115; 025-456-929-228-278; 027-150-047-044-961; 027-548-821-496-845; 027-637-887-931-488; 032-437-388-057-540; 034-814-442-011-302; 038-672-445-354-954; 041-124-398-281-174; 047-307-839-107-965; 049-173-702-567-663; 049-922-825-394-93X; 053-135-321-085-916; 056-056-498-989-48X; 063-895-958-763-58X; 064-815-458-728-247; 066-860-226-304-002; 068-729-648-684-163; 072-191-893-627-536; 079-367-665-908-927; 081-370-959-105-221; 083-411-957-107-646; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-748-427-455-489; 092-886-026-176-729; 093-155-519-399-573; 094-634-722-566-618; 096-000-550-841-414; 110-844-316-041-596; 132-958-917-686-422; 146-071-057-852-048; 157-508-792-046-796,0,false,,

  Centrality Method",2021-09-28,2021,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Eglantine Karlé; Hemant Tyagi,"Many applications such as recommendation systems or sports tournaments involve pairwise comparisons within a collection of $n$ items, the goal being to aggregate the binary outcomes of the comparisons in order to recover the latent strength and/or global ranking of the items. In recent years, this problem has received significant interest from a theoretical perspective with a number of methods being proposed, along with associated statistical guarantees under the assumption of a suitable generative model. While these results typically collect the pairwise comparisons as one comparison graph $G$, however in many applications - such as the outcomes of soccer matches during a tournament - the nature of pairwise outcomes can evolve with time. Theoretical results for such a dynamic setting are relatively limited compared to the aforementioned static setting. We study in this paper an extension of the classic BTL (Bradley-Terry-Luce) model for the static setting to our dynamic setup under the assumption that the probabilities of the pairwise outcomes evolve smoothly over the time domain $[0,1]$. Given a sequence of comparison graphs $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ on a regular grid $\mathcal{T} \subset [0,1]$, we aim at recovering the latent strengths of the items $w_t^* \in \mathbb{R}^n$ at any time $t \in [0,1]$. To this end, we adapt the Rank Centrality method - a popular spectral approach for ranking in the static case - by locally averaging the available data on a suitable neighborhood of $t$. When $(G_{t'})_{t' \in \mathcal{T}}$ is a sequence of Erd\""os-Renyi graphs, we provide non-asymptotic $\ell_2$ and $\ell_{\infty}$ error bounds for estimating $w_t^*$ which in particular establishes the consistency of this method in terms of $n$, and the grid size $\lvert\mathcal{T}\rvert$. We also complement our theoretical analysis with experiments on real and synthetic data.",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Centrality; Ranking (information retrieval); Sequence (biology); Computer science; Rank (graph theory); Graph; Generative model; Extension (predicate logic); Combinatorics; Aggregate (composite); Mathematics; Theoretical computer science; Algorithm; Generative grammar; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Materials science; Biology; Composite material; Genetics; Programming language,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.13743,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2109.13743,,10.48550/arxiv.2109.13743,,,0,,0,true,,green

Bartholomew; Amelia Chesley; Sweta Baniya; Dawn Laux,"This study discusses a writing assessment for State University’s first year integrated experience of Technology 120: Design Thinking in Technology and English 106: First-Year Writing and the implications it provides for curriculum design. The study used Adaptive Comparative Judgment to determine whether integrated research essays that utilized design thinking were more rhetorically effective (i.e., better attuned to addressing a purpose, audience, and context) than non-integrated English composition research essays. Results showed the non-integrated research essays had a statistically significant better rating than the integrated courses; this finding was counterintuitive to our expectations, therefore we utilized NVivo to conduct a word frequency analysis on judges’ holistic comments to determine strengths and weaknesses of the essays. The word frequency analysis demonstrated writing concepts were much stronger and more effective in a standard composition course. These findings led to the development of three literature-based curriculum and pedagogical changes to ensure that integrated students achieve general education writing outcomes in concert with design thinking principles—something our results showed as lacking significantly in these courses.",,,1,23,Design thinking; Mathematics education; Psychology; Educational technology; Writing assessment; Context (language use); Composition (language); Science education; Curriculum; Strengths and weaknesses,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-020-09650-6,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-020-09650-6,,,3119556187,,0,001-501-293-778-301; 002-807-214-431-018; 008-031-819-610-142; 008-480-275-000-074; 011-845-943-097-156; 011-948-343-384-639; 012-082-389-054-645; 013-888-372-922-687; 016-594-262-985-308; 016-634-297-116-560; 019-749-985-752-877; 020-309-532-368-123; 021-603-472-571-480; 021-815-639-110-470; 022-066-951-009-490; 022-421-580-031-915; 024-593-640-147-754; 030-744-670-332-689; 032-114-441-104-152; 033-498-766-332-569; 034-689-136-329-443; 035-558-357-677-843; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-426-516-197-907; 055-409-664-806-189; 059-388-706-870-345; 059-569-549-998-769; 062-203-246-560-649; 063-749-124-741-047; 063-863-517-456-537; 064-284-514-642-334; 064-290-082-816-724; 065-117-194-043-399; 065-854-078-069-33X; 066-622-143-118-657; 069-253-271-029-69X; 069-348-493-884-36X; 069-872-099-132-179; 072-610-149-469-166; 074-399-622-472-152; 076-479-106-655-748; 076-658-980-731-966; 078-593-453-884-58X; 082-605-722-357-463; 083-807-532-483-305; 085-022-019-606-055; 085-148-926-517-48X; 088-945-129-877-811; 094-397-854-802-92X; 096-306-390-509-27X; 096-694-737-448-662; 102-367-701-804-693; 107-096-746-639-636; 107-777-323-573-27X; 109-529-712-690-576; 109-913-382-999-285; 110-720-282-753-522; 113-414-530-226-064; 114-798-924-818-558; 115-939-452-532-043; 119-780-804-465-299; 124-078-044-235-095; 126-454-221-798-016; 135-119-816-282-391; 136-606-604-022-63X; 140-001-470-875-217; 153-048-516-372-202; 163-938-197-264-411; 168-992-674-158-005; 171-324-720-934-998; 173-260-452-071-067; 173-456-394-443-452; 197-477-967-493-902,0,false,,

Celebrated by proponents as a transparent process that allows policy makers produce data informed judgments about relative quality of their national education system PISA – and through it the OECD – has become a key vehicle for informing and explaining educational policy development. This paper explores the Irish and Spanish outcomes of the 2018 round of PISA. It examines the contextual factors that are associated with performance at student and school level while at the same time developing a multi-level statistical model to explain divergent school performance profiles It finds that issues associated with the socio-economic level of the students, the repetition rate, and student age are common across all domains in both countries. It suggests that the socio-economic status of Spanish students at school level is not significant, that the shortage of teachers in Ireland affects student performance, and that immigrant status does not disadvantage Spanish student performance. It concludes by suggesting that studies involving a wider application of the model be undertaken to assess possible social, economic, and cultural causes that may explain the differences in variable significance in each country.</jats:p>",9,,,,Multilevel model; Computer science; Mathematics education; Psychology; Machine learning,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2024.1306197/pdf?isPublishedV2=False https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1306197,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2024.1306197,,10.3389/feduc.2024.1306197,,,0,006-314-853-287-032; 006-798-591-536-185; 010-429-041-757-216; 014-778-087-352-872; 022-810-439-077-235; 026-568-721-282-69X; 029-761-871-445-822; 036-079-702-832-890; 042-323-575-792-062; 042-828-308-808-406; 044-402-071-474-376; 044-544-193-574-635; 053-229-543-177-506; 054-307-971-399-751; 063-484-268-551-911; 065-424-423-117-583; 067-036-772-323-260; 067-661-798-644-808; 069-569-000-403-935; 070-466-743-168-407; 071-872-490-909-034; 072-216-603-034-926; 073-185-610-913-002; 087-152-447-583-150; 092-381-527-533-022; 094-651-193-375-246; 098-691-217-571-578; 102-968-371-020-59X; 103-232-037-086-416; 108-289-457-126-313; 111-606-716-436-266; 116-632-364-994-379; 133-174-121-164-136; 145-548-154-064-974; 148-095-130-416-461; 151-389-376-042-924; 182-705-811-968-673; 190-016-262-984-270; 197-366-743-444-915,0,true,cc-by,gold

Despite the wide range of metrics for rankings that can be considered in the model specification, the choice is typically limited to the Kendall, Cayley or Hamming distances, due to the closed-form expression of the related model normalizing constant. This work instead focuses on the Mallows model with Spearman distance (MMS). A novel approximation of the normalizing constant is introduced to allow inference even with a large number of items. This allows us to develop and implement an efficient and accurate EM algorithm for estimating finite mixtures of MMS aimed at i) enlarging the applicability to samples drawn from heterogeneous populations, and ii) dealing with partial rankings affected by diverse forms of censoring. These novelties encompass the critical inferential steps that traditionally limited the use of this distance in practice, and render the MMS comparable (or even preferable) to the MMs with other metrics in terms of computational burden. The inferential ability of the EM scheme and the effectiveness of the approximation are assessed by extensive simulation studies. Finally, we show that the application to three real-world datasets endorses our proposals also in the comparison with competing mixtures of ranking models.",33,5,,,Inference; Ranking (information retrieval); Parametric statistics; Population; Mathematics; Computer science; Range (aeronautics); Hamming distance; Statistical inference; Machine learning; Data mining; Statistics; Artificial intelligence; Algorithm; Materials science; Demography; Sociology; Composite material,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.09821 https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.09821,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11222-023-10266-8,,10.1007/s11222-023-10266-8,,,0,007-512-146-614-819; 016-543-992-918-967; 017-081-732-842-09X; 017-199-322-306-650; 019-118-136-145-932; 030-905-914-373-263; 031-729-577-506-489; 038-057-736-190-684; 038-442-349-447-110; 041-043-784-011-725; 041-417-609-729-653; 045-747-103-504-85X; 047-144-414-137-647; 048-597-194-899-33X; 051-901-132-474-098; 052-637-757-521-487; 068-762-846-278-363; 075-305-853-433-915; 086-915-713-674-87X; 093-445-128-683-492; 097-647-310-793-680; 106-565-440-990-581; 107-965-872-419-29X; 111-743-383-960-174; 116-446-950-034-320; 125-503-112-115-038; 128-455-532-196-415; 137-906-775-154-398; 145-154-233-391-939; 148-732-245-960-140; 152-706-626-735-700; 165-522-729-323-27X; 168-516-239-872-872; 189-060-196-034-842; 189-168-054-812-367,0,true,,green

108-796-370-532-366,On the information obtainable from comparative judgments,2021-02-25,2021,preprint,,,Center for Open Science,,Paul - Christian Bürkner,"<p>Personality tests employing comparative judgments have been proposed as an alternative to Likert-type rating scales. One of the main advantages of a comparative format is that it can reduce faking of responses in high-stakes situations. However, previous research has shown that it is highly difficult to obtain trait score estimates that are both faking resistant and sufficiently accurate for individual-level diagnostic decisions. With the goal of contributing to a solution, I study the information obtainable from comparative judgments analyzed by means of Thurstonian IRT models. First, I extend the mathematical theory of ordinal comparative judgments and corresponding models. Second, I provide optimal test designs for Thurstonian IRT models that maximize the accuracy of people's trait score estimates from both frequentist and Bayesian statistical perspectives. Third, I derive analytic upper bounds for the accuracy of these trait estimates achievable through ordinal Thurstonian IRT models. Fourth, I perform numerical experiments that complement results obtained in earlier simulation studies.

Simultaneously, they viewed the stimulus under one of five visual conditions: No vision, Filtered vision + touch, Veridical vision + touch (where vision alone yielded roughness discrimination at chance), Congruent vision + touch, Incongruent vision + touch. Results from 32 participants showed roughness discrimination for touch with vision was better than touch alone.

Furthermore, the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) method was employed to identify the most optimal model and design for the propeller turbine. Problem-solving within the AHP framework was guided by three fundamental principles, namely decomposition, Comparative Judgment, and Logical Consistency. The procedure included problem decomposition, assessment/ weighting to compare elements, matrix preparation and consistency testing, setting priorities for each hierarchy, priority synthesis, and decision-making. To establish a benchmark, three types of propeller turbines currently available in the market served as references. Meanwhile, the selection criteria for the model were based on several factors, including power factor, time efficiency, ease of manufacture, as well as production and maintenance costs. Considering the criteria, modifications were made to these reference models, resulting in the development of alternatives, denoted as A, B, and C. The results showed that alternative type A as the most suitable choice for further development. Therefore, this particular design was granted foremost priority to develop a low-head generator that possessed ease of manufacturing and surpassed alternative models in terms of feasibility. </jats:p>",27,3,361,361,Analytic hierarchy process; Weighting; Consistency (knowledge bases); Propeller; Selection (genetic algorithm); Computer science; Hierarchy; Benchmark (surveying); Process (computing); Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Operations research; Reliability engineering; Industrial engineering; Engineering; Artificial intelligence; Medicine; Geodesy; Marine engineering; Economics; Market economy; Radiology; Geography; Operating system,,,,,https://publikasi.mercubuana.ac.id/index.php/sinergi/article/download/18506/7445 https://doi.org/10.22441/sinergi.2023.3.007,http://dx.doi.org/10.22441/sinergi.2023.3.007,,10.22441/sinergi.2023.3.007,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc,gold

  Scaling of Texts with Large Language Models",2023-10-18,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Patrick Y. Wu; Jonathan Nagler; Joshua A. Tucker; Solomon Messing,"Existing text scaling methods often require a large corpus, struggle with short texts, or require labeled data. We develop a text scaling method that leverages the pattern recognition capabilities of generative large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we propose concept-guided chain-of-thought (CGCoT), which uses prompts designed to summarize ideas and identify target parties in texts to generate concept-specific breakdowns, in many ways similar to guidance for human coder content analysis. CGCoT effectively shifts pairwise text comparisons from a reasoning problem to a pattern recognition problem. We then pairwise compare concept-specific breakdowns using an LLM. We use the results of these pairwise comparisons to estimate a scale using the Bradley-Terry model. We use this approach to scale affective speech on Twitter. Our measures correlate more strongly with human judgments than alternative approaches like Wordfish. Besides a small set of pilot data to develop the CGCoT prompts, our measures require no additional labeled data and produce binary predictions comparable to a RoBERTa-Large model fine-tuned on thousands of human-labeled tweets. We demonstrate how combining substantive knowledge with LLMs can create state-of-the-art measures of abstract concepts.",,,,,Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Set (abstract data type); Natural language processing; Artificial intelligence; Generative grammar; Scale (ratio); Scaling; Generative model; Mathematics; Physics; Geometry; Quantum mechanics; Programming language,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12049,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.12049,,10.48550/arxiv.2310.12049,,,0,,0,true,,green

Specifically, asking ""Which came earlier?"" versus ""Which came later?"" facilitates response times and sometimes error rates on judgments toward the beginning or end of the list, respectively. This suggests memory judgments of relative temporal order may be part of a broader class of comparative judgments. If so, the same congruity effect should also be found with the English alphabet, despite the alphabet being a longer, semantic-memory list, with forward directional encoding. A large-sample study (<i>N</i> = 340) produced a clear congruity effect in response time and even error rate (when controlled for response time). The large number of serial positions afforded by the alphabet enabled us to test a repertoire of mathematical models instantiating four distinct mechanisms of the congruity effect, against the empirical serial-position effects. The best-performing model assumed a response bias toward a discrete set of letters conceived of as ""early"" versus ""late,"" respectively, an account that had previously been ruled out for typical comparative-judgment paradigms. In contrast, models implementing congruity effect mechanisms supported for conventional comparative judgment paradigms (based on reference-point theory or positional discriminability) produced quantitatively poorer fits, with more curvilinear serial-position effects that deviated from the data. The congruity effect thus extends to long, highly directional semantic-memory lists. However, qualitatively different serial-position effects across models suggest that, despite the superficial similarity, there are probably several quite different mechanisms that produce congruity effects, which may, in turn, depend on specific task characteristics.

I share the sentiment that this phenomenon has been an injustice. But it also has become orthodoxy to allege that the acceptance of a retributive penal philosophy has been one of the chief factors that has brought about mass incarceration in the first place. As a self-proclaimed retributivist, I find these allegations to be troubling and unwarranted. The point of this paper is to take steps to rebut them. I begin by making four conceptual points about retributivism. If I am correct, retributivism comes in countless flavors, and the particular variety to which I am most attracted can be applied to show why some punishments should be less severe than those presently imposed. Next I argue that many persons deserve less punishment than our legal system currently inflicts. Reflection about whether perpetrators should be afforded a complete or partial defense reveals retributivism to be less punitive than conventional wisdom would suggest.",41,2-3,1,23,Retributive justice; Philosophy of law; Political science; Law and economics; Punishment; Injustice; Mass incarceration; Conventional wisdom; Political philosophy; Punitive damages,,,,,https://www.researchwithrutgers.com/en/publications/retributivism-and-over-punishment https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8417646 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10982-021-09422-w.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10982-021-09422-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10982-021-09422-w,34511672,10.1007/s10982-021-09422-w,3198061571,PMC8417646,0,,4,true,,green

Zhang,"The Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model is a benchmark model for pairwise comparisons between individuals. Despite recent progress on the first-order asymptotics of several popular procedures, the understanding of uncertainty quantification in the BTL model remains largely incomplete, especially when the underlying comparison graph is sparse. In this paper, we fill this gap by focusing on two estimators that have received much recent attention: the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) and the spectral estimator. Using a unified proof strategy, we derive sharp and uniform non-asymptotic expansions for both estimators in the sparsest possible regime (up to some poly-logarithmic factors) of the underlying comparison graph. These expansions allow us to obtain: (i) finite-dimensional central limit theorems for both estimators; (ii) construction of confidence intervals for individual ranks; (iii) optimal constant of $\ell_2$ estimation, which is achieved by the MLE but not by the spectral estimator. Our proof is based on a self-consistent equation of the second-order remainder vector and a novel leave-two-out analysis.",,,,,Graph (abstract data type); Benchmark (computing); Central limit theorem; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Applied mathematics; Uncertainty quantification; Mathematics; Remainder; Confidence interval,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03874 http://arxiv.org/pdf/2110.03874.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211003874G/abstract,https://arxiv.org/abs/2110.03874,,,3206260294,,0,001-004-209-528-581; 004-682-225-354-448; 015-164-124-848-632; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-501-390-008-829; 027-048-508-707-668; 027-896-243-015-499; 031-830-169-787-740; 043-264-056-581-481; 045-187-870-348-998; 047-307-839-107-965; 050-943-988-713-681; 057-657-809-679-383; 060-068-079-220-441; 076-093-674-995-474; 077-666-628-696-045; 081-370-959-105-221; 099-591-362-848-965; 109-668-006-494-690; 134-525-550-834-589; 146-071-057-852-048; 155-377-745-647-425; 188-851-886-159-33X,0,true,,unknown

We emphasize the dynamic, temporal and enactive characteristics of the self-pattern, consistent with the core Buddhist notion of non-self. Although there is no one-to-one mapping of Buddhist psychological concepts onto the pattern theory of self, there are important similarities among such concepts and the various processes and dynamical relations that constitute a pragmatic self-pattern that can explain both experiences of self and non-self. Buddhist psychology and the notion of the self-pattern offer mutual insight into the processes, the dynamics, and the implications for questions about well-being and a flexibility that avoids anxiety and reduces attachment, craving, and suffering.</jats:p>",,,,,Buddhism; Psychology; Self psychology; Self; Flexibility (engineering); Mindfulness; Cognitive psychology; Social psychology; Epistemology; Cognitive science; Psychotherapist; Philosophy; Statistics; Theology; Mathematics,,,,The University of Wollongong,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s12671-023-02118-3.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s12671-023-02118-3 https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/files/71356108/MCP_Nyklicek_the_self_pattern_and_Buddhist_psychology_Mindfulness_2023.pdf https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/3b666011-6a15-439e-aeab-3cc7ac41e28b https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/71356108/MCP_Nyklicek_the_self_pattern_and_Buddhist_psychology_Mindfulness_2023.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12671-023-02118-3,,10.1007/s12671-023-02118-3,,,0,006-988-073-756-716; 011-093-207-505-271; 011-274-572-630-110; 015-623-944-928-662; 017-660-832-385-136; 018-008-268-207-388; 022-247-373-246-373; 022-813-727-860-914; 027-236-494-323-548; 030-766-201-633-187; 031-103-631-745-030; 033-250-849-578-020; 033-579-745-063-683; 035-308-613-615-19X; 035-818-990-317-622; 041-221-365-505-885; 042-719-904-037-887; 049-624-358-658-83X; 050-818-055-007-280; 051-395-434-617-868; 061-180-976-332-837; 065-506-087-864-377; 067-064-466-717-753; 068-471-603-360-143; 070-022-174-081-995; 072-139-764-522-975; 072-367-862-489-683; 080-201-983-847-467; 083-290-014-464-586; 094-354-853-668-319; 105-650-081-271-98X; 106-554-140-971-924; 125-658-057-387-001; 126-154-490-693-015; 131-423-542-523-282; 132-171-821-780-220; 153-207-936-716-935; 159-514-623-204-507; 175-687-830-719-103; 177-315-215-137-780; 181-173-078-425-789; 194-637-054-486-020,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Concreteness is defined as the amount of extraneous information a manipulative provides, and in this study we aimed to unpick which dimensions of concreteness influence manipulative choice. Researchers, teachers, and parents completed a comparative judgment task comparing images of manipulatives varying in different dimensions of concreteness, selecting which they would choose to teach arithmetic to children. The findings indicated homogeneous, 3‐dimensional manipulatives were the most preferred across all groups to teach arithmetic to children, regardless of more extraneous features. This contradicts research recommendations to minimize the use of concrete manipulatives due to their distractive qualities. Instead, it suggests that some concrete features may be preferred in more naturalistic contexts. More research is required to investigate how different dimensions of concreteness influence learning outcomes for children both in artificial research contexts and in practice.</jats:p>",17,3,185,196,Concreteness; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Homogeneous; Task (project management); Mathematics education; Computer science; Mathematics; Management; Combinatorics; Economics,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1111/mbe.12374 https://doi.org/10.1111/mbe.12374 https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_effects_of_concreteness_on_mathematical_manipulative_choice/23587140/1/files/42383796.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/journal_contribution/The_effects_of_concreteness_on_mathematical_manipulative_choice/23587140,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/mbe.12374,,10.1111/mbe.12374,,,0,004-349-465-899-325; 005-252-244-345-519; 008-630-259-277-891; 009-322-247-313-308; 012-465-499-164-691; 014-470-749-868-78X; 020-006-189-834-271; 021-086-148-231-502; 031-949-577-473-140; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-738-733-692-760; 048-151-229-726-003; 064-494-927-411-927; 066-944-254-686-851; 068-124-584-046-362; 068-837-971-297-209; 069-390-832-512-253; 075-428-728-183-953; 087-991-691-200-809; 122-448-167-938-324; 123-800-693-206-808; 148-673-033-661-432,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Our emphasis is on pathways to expertise in the context of deliberate practice theory and associated models, such as the Developmental Model of Sport Participation (DMSP). Despite rationale for sex and gender differences in sport development, there are relatively few studies where the developmental pathways of female elite athletes have been evaluated. We sought to map the scope of the literature on this population over the last 30 years, focusing on measures of practice types and amounts. Following an extensive search of the literature, 32 studies were identified that included all female participants or presented sex/gender disaggregated data. Retrospective methods were commonly used to quantify practice, play and specialization. National-level athletes were the most represented, although there was considerable heterogeneity in sport and expertise-level, making general or comparative judgements challenging. We identified some groups that had accumulated high volumes of practice at a young age, particularly in soccer and gymnastics. Across sports and studies, early majority hours of engagement in the primary sport was the norm. Athletes deviated from predictions in the specialization pathway detailed in the DMSP, by continuing to participate in other sports throughout childhood and adolescence. In addition to highlighting the relative paucity of data pertaining to athlete development pathways in female athletes, we show that the data from these groups deviate from predictions detailed in current models of athlete development.",4,,903886,,Athletes; Psychology; Context (archaeology); Elite athletes; Population; Developmental psychology; Medicine; Geography; Physical therapy; Environmental health; Archaeology,deliberate practice; expertise; play; specialization; talent,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fspor.2022.903886/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.903886 https://nrl.northumbria.ac.uk/id/eprint/50432/1/fspor-04-903886.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fspor.2022.903886,36213454,10.3389/fspor.2022.903886,,PMC9538116,0,000-008-665-660-975; 001-778-185-627-217; 003-806-878-651-875; 003-819-060-993-695; 005-415-807-534-027; 008-442-686-446-954; 011-552-248-640-103; 012-064-439-084-684; 012-590-295-718-843; 012-602-051-928-073; 014-275-345-854-783; 014-459-383-467-369; 015-128-812-675-773; 016-667-948-756-002; 017-300-737-144-757; 019-201-420-281-170; 024-204-171-542-468; 025-401-601-126-667; 025-652-923-289-545; 026-269-883-456-816; 026-706-163-043-960; 028-177-962-176-841; 028-625-174-566-060; 029-955-597-914-90X; 035-429-405-150-27X; 036-354-914-131-643; 036-744-275-239-378; 038-587-954-751-96X; 041-900-859-106-395; 043-203-573-995-86X; 047-138-279-418-014; 048-462-574-599-058; 049-022-104-616-949; 052-313-824-274-682; 054-889-688-661-649; 057-168-776-702-737; 057-844-463-213-204; 057-866-301-550-096; 058-114-558-051-828; 061-615-193-256-567; 062-618-468-633-123; 064-977-109-119-285; 070-090-916-897-809; 073-890-056-622-85X; 078-847-914-947-887; 085-306-496-235-853; 093-163-937-603-91X; 093-287-588-938-926; 095-000-471-037-86X; 095-205-785-062-207; 099-109-971-297-689; 099-943-617-865-30X; 100-482-333-772-894; 104-546-372-160-028; 106-453-440-196-680; 106-617-573-280-497; 121-057-840-563-135; 127-431-348-632-472; 131-645-556-250-581; 133-351-239-513-80X; 137-809-286-025-814; 141-993-921-265-487; 144-621-378-645-34X; 154-677-551-670-692; 158-514-660-347-148; 173-372-812-317-355; 175-804-651-748-54X; 179-452-641-484-236,6,true,cc-by,gold

Instead of relying on numerical rewards, the generative models are trained using reinforcement learning with human feedback (RLHF). These approaches first solicit feedback from human labelers typically in the form of pairwise comparisons between two possible actions, then estimate a reward model using these comparisons, and finally employ a policy based on the estimated reward model. An adversarial attack in any step of the above pipeline might reveal private and sensitive information of human labelers. In this work, we adopt the notion of label differential privacy (DP) and focus on the problem of reward estimation from preference-based feedback while protecting privacy of each individual labelers. Specifically, we consider the parametric Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for such pairwise comparison feedback involving a latent reward parameter $\theta^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$. Within a standard minimax estimation framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the error in estimating $\theta^*$ under both local and central models of DP. We show, for a given privacy budget $\epsilon$ and number of samples $n$, that the additional cost to ensure label-DP under local model is $\Theta \big(\frac{1}{ e^\epsilon-1}\sqrt{\frac{d}{n}}\big)$, while it is $\Theta\big(\frac{\text{poly}(d)}{\epsilon n} \big)$ under the weaker central model. We perform simulations on synthetic data that corroborate these theoretical results.",,,,,Minimax; Differential privacy; Pairwise comparison; Generative model; Computer science; Preference; Reinforcement learning; Artificial intelligence; Generative grammar; Machine learning; Algorithm; Mathematical optimization; Mathematics; Statistics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.19733,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2310.19733,,10.48550/arxiv.2310.19733,,,0,,0,true,,green

ACJ is an adaptive software tool that can be used by students and faculty to assess students’ work holistically and reliably. This tool can be used to reduce the grading load associated with project work and reduce the time taken to grade and provide feedback to students. The goal of this workshop is to introduce participants to the ACJ approach. The process underpinning the ACJ software tool will be explored, and participants will be taken through the procedure of setting up an ACJ session and given the opportunity to experience the process of assessment using the ACJ tool. Following this hands-on experience of ACJ, participants and facilitators will discuss the possible benefits and challenges of using ACJ in a formative and summative assessment capacity with first-year engineering students. Workshop attendees will require a device that is wireless fidelity enabled.",,,,,Judgement; Computer science; Management science; Engineering; Epistemology; Philosophy,,,,,https://peer.asee.org/42264.pdf https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--42264,http://dx.doi.org/10.18260/1-2--42264,,10.18260/1-2--42264,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Ashley Steel; Nadine Fleischhut,"<jats:p>Abstract. Earthquake models can produce aftershock forecasts, which have recently been released to lay audiences. While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location's forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1) forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2) the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3) two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. We compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that were specifically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a Comparative Judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the visual communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.</jats:p>",22,4,1499,1518,Visualization; Aftershock; Computer science; Data visualization; Readability; Transparency (behavior); Data mining; Geology; Seismology; Computer security; Programming language,,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/1499/2022/nhess-22-1499-2022.pdf https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1499-2022 https://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/item_5011996_2/component/file_5012015/5011996.pdf https://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/item_5011996 https://gfzpublic.gfz-potsdam.de/pubman/item/item_5011996_1/component/file_5012015/5011996.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-22-1499-2022,,10.5194/nhess-22-1499-2022,,,0,000-263-962-107-189; 005-100-750-611-055; 005-121-479-881-965; 006-728-651-303-233; 009-697-657-555-378; 013-044-216-573-569; 019-120-790-033-33X; 021-111-854-090-091; 023-943-601-695-708; 024-110-417-355-164; 024-547-489-616-61X; 031-099-755-367-554; 042-104-033-522-500; 044-526-249-791-008; 045-724-356-535-855; 047-127-432-680-972; 052-428-400-308-850; 055-140-017-749-983; 055-154-490-994-447; 058-054-410-523-794; 059-209-067-686-421; 066-957-199-065-464; 069-366-969-453-266; 069-596-099-567-65X; 074-042-125-701-75X; 078-638-737-245-401; 080-894-315-956-814; 081-744-771-223-238; 088-065-547-927-513; 089-449-404-834-351; 089-660-685-406-356; 093-687-483-313-041; 098-417-535-218-049; 099-687-185-780-539; 104-473-164-165-946; 105-249-417-793-757; 109-567-105-029-273; 115-871-781-877-116; 131-381-115-498-729; 132-047-073-950-192; 132-657-502-621-820; 136-376-004-043-858; 143-212-593-049-221; 143-733-461-662-618; 147-004-356-463-946,2,true,cc-by,gold

What is it to appreciate art while relying on predictions, and to what consequences? I argue that art appreciation involves engaging our predictive systems in such a way as to correct predictive failure at least at some levels in the processing hierarchy of information that we receive from art works. That art appreciation involves predictive processing best explains the mechanism for cognizing art works in categories, cases of appreciative failure, and why art appreciation is a form of valuing. To articulate the explanatory value of predictive processing for cognizing art works in categories, I introduce a sub-type of predictions that I call art-historical estimates – i.e., predictions that take as their object the temporal relationships between works and their place in art history – and identify their features within a broader typology of predictions and related mental structures such as schemas and scripts. I examine the way predictive processing explains the correction of predictive failure, and its consequences for the affective value that we attach to the appreciation of art.</jats:p>",,,,,Typology; Philosophy of mind; Value (mathematics); Predictive value; Hierarchy; Philosophy of science; Psychology; Epistemology; Computer science; Sociology; Philosophy; Machine learning; Metaphysics; Economics; Medicine; Anthropology; Internal medicine; Market economy,,,,Masaryk University,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s13164-023-00696-8.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s13164-023-00696-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13164-023-00696-8,,10.1007/s13164-023-00696-8,,,0,002-122-098-143-892; 006-425-305-675-036; 007-479-572-678-936; 009-562-460-608-650; 010-539-775-131-826; 011-248-442-083-05X; 012-130-144-575-366; 012-246-822-907-919; 012-319-483-468-935; 014-142-678-208-692; 019-076-944-739-445; 022-146-492-596-357; 023-023-389-190-427; 028-346-640-900-467; 029-265-639-145-486; 032-280-785-068-339; 033-301-297-872-72X; 038-564-696-760-465; 039-320-290-299-969; 042-491-649-124-888; 051-293-438-374-536; 051-877-863-303-631; 055-585-841-475-791; 056-174-281-397-43X; 057-608-253-097-845; 060-177-504-894-766; 060-596-452-741-683; 060-838-975-581-446; 069-334-880-225-164; 071-738-929-801-576; 072-801-905-246-26X; 076-352-529-093-11X; 080-090-162-527-387; 099-872-303-059-967; 105-409-152-071-192; 125-949-388-639-760; 127-728-309-014-10X; 131-209-177-965-439; 155-169-485-343-743,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Although early item response theory (IRT) research focused on illustrating that person parameter estimates with normative properties could be obtained using various MFC models and formats, more recent attention has been devoted to exploring the processes involved in test construction and how that influences MFC scores. This research compared two approaches for estimating multi-unidimensional pairwise preference model (MUPP; Stark et al., 2005) parameters based on the generalized graded unfolding model (GGUM; Roberts et al., 2000). More specifically, we compared the efficacy of statement and person parameter estimation based on a ""two-step"" process, developed by Stark et al.

Previous evidence has shown that stimulus size can affect perceived duration even when size differences are illusory. In the present study, we investigated the effect of visual-spatial illusions on duration judgments in a temporal reproduction paradigm. Specifically, we induced the Ebbinghaus illusion (Exp. 1) and the horizontal-vertical illusion (Exp. 2) during the encoding phase of the target interval or the reproduction phase. The results showed (a) that illusory size affects temporal processing similarly to the way physical size does, (b) that the effect is independent of whether the illusion appeared during encoding or reproduction, and (c) that the interference between size and temporal processing is bidirectional.

Not much is known about the effectiveness of such exercises when teaching style. Unknown factors include&nbsp; what kinds of stylistic shortcomings are found in Dutch students’ writing, and how the occurrence of certain stylistic lapses relates to writing quality. The current study empirically explores these scarcely investigated issues. Teachers rated 125 argumentative texts written by tenth-grade pre-university students by means of comparative judgement. Additionally, these texts were manually analyzed to investigate the occurrence of stylistic lapses, taking into account stylistic lapses that are common in text books (‘standard category’) and other types of style related errors (‘other category’). Multilevel regression analyses revealed that only one of the stylistic lapses from the standard category negatively influenced text quality as evaluated by teachers, namely the use of detached phrases. In the other category, only mistakes in question marks negatively predicted text quality. A final model including those two predictors explained 11.1% of the variance in text quality.

However, both types of knowledge are needed for complete domain knowledge that persists over time and supports subsequent learning. We investigated in two quasi-experimental studies whether a combination of an exploratory learning environment, providing exploratory tasks, and an intelligent tutoring system, providing structured tasks, fosters procedural and conceptual knowledge more than the intelligent tutoring system alone. Participants were 121 students from the UK (aged 8–10 years old) and 151 students from Germany (aged 10–12 years old) who were studying equivalent fractions. Results confirmed that students learning with a combination of exploratory and structured tasks gained more conceptual knowledge and equal procedural knowledge compared to students learning with structured tasks only. This supports the use of different but complementary educational technologies, interleaving exploratory and structured tasks, to achieve a “combination effect” that fosters robust fractions knowledge.</jats:p>",70,3,691,712,Procedural knowledge; Exploratory research; Educational technology; Knowledge management; Computer science; Domain knowledge; Psychology; Mathematics education; Sociology; Anthropology,,,,FP7 Science in Society,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11423-022-10104-0.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11423-022-10104-0 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10147018/1/Mavrikis_2022_Article_CombiningExploratoryLearningWi.pdf https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10147018/ https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10147018/1/Mavrikis_2022_Article_CombiningExploratoryLearningWi.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11423-022-10104-0,,10.1007/s11423-022-10104-0,,,0,000-129-573-574-624; 000-429-200-309-160; 003-912-384-158-414; 004-257-050-498-919; 007-739-218-922-877; 010-303-226-357-741; 015-663-921-751-856; 020-145-421-293-167; 020-829-091-449-743; 027-107-698-069-421; 028-349-490-722-899; 029-119-687-814-992; 030-340-736-994-132; 031-841-538-457-565; 035-267-899-481-01X; 035-559-573-843-521; 035-733-419-005-715; 042-286-771-954-575; 043-248-895-026-075; 049-107-132-921-150; 058-928-696-374-855; 065-255-361-377-034; 068-416-998-636-340; 070-276-991-766-003; 070-738-692-783-392; 073-515-477-267-476; 073-919-504-000-584; 077-776-308-204-598; 080-885-152-596-468; 081-008-982-322-45X; 082-447-521-850-912; 083-091-935-133-616; 086-929-747-994-414; 090-419-891-278-249; 094-250-415-203-515; 094-515-413-932-504; 096-824-929-866-802; 109-604-178-712-209; 110-055-206-604-413; 115-988-249-101-265; 118-082-961-654-451; 120-148-207-361-121; 122-448-167-938-324; 128-343-478-881-529; 128-759-338-875-409; 136-879-171-140-270; 142-915-512-806-257; 148-742-551-920-533; 149-857-979-383-237,5,true,cc-by,hybrid

Abad; Miguel A. Sorrel,"The use of multidimensional forced-choice questionnaires has been proposed as a means of improving validity in the assessment of non-cognitive attributes in high-stakes scenarios. However, the reduced precision of trait estimates in this questionnaire format is an important drawback. Accordingly, this article presents an optimization procedure for assembling pairwise forced-choice questionnaires while maximizing posterior marginal reliabilities. This procedure is performed through the adaptation of a known genetic algorithm (GA) for combinatorial problems. In a simulation study, the efficiency of the proposed procedure was compared with a quasi-brute-force (BF) search. For this purpose, five-dimensional item pools were simulated to emulate the real problem of generating a forced-choice personality questionnaire under the five-factor model. Three factors were manipulated: (1) the length of the questionnaire, (2) the relative item pool size with respect to the questionnaire’s length, and (3) the true correlations between traits. The recovery of the person parameters for each assembled questionnaire was evaluated through the squared correlation between estimated and true parameters, the root mean square error between the estimated and true parameters, the average difference between the estimated and true inter-trait correlations, and the average standard error for each trait level.

  baseball data",2021-03-22,2021,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Harriet Spearing; Jonathan Tawn; David Irons; Tim Paulden,"In most commonly used ranking systems, some level of underlying transitivity is assumed. If transitivity exists in a system then information about pairwise comparisons can be translated to other linked pairs. For example, if typically A beats B and B beats C, this could inform us about the expected outcome between A and C. We show that in the seminal Bradley-Terry model knowing the probabilities of A beating B and B beating C completely defines the probability of A beating C, with these probabilities determined by individual skill levels of A, B and C. Users of this model tend not to investigate the validity of this transitive assumption, nor that some skill levels may not be statistically significantly different from each other; the latter leading to false conclusions about rankings. We provide a novel extension to the Bradley-Terry model, which accounts for both of these features: the intransitive relationships between pairs of objects are dealt with through interaction terms that are specific to each pair; and by partitioning the $n$ skills into $A+1\leq n$ distinct clusters, any differences in the objects' skills become significant, given appropriate $A$. With $n$ competitors there are $n(n-1)/2$ interactions, so even in multiple round robin competitions this gives too many parameters to efficiently estimate. Therefore we separately cluster the $n(n-1)/2$ values of intransitivity into $K$ clusters, giving $(A,K)$ estimatable values respectively, typically with $A+K<n$. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, $(A,K)$ are treated as unknown, and inference is conducted via a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. The model is shown to have an improved fit out of sample in both simulated data and when applied to American League baseball data.",,,,,Transitive relation; Pairwise comparison; Ranking (information retrieval); Outcome (game theory); Bayesian inference; Extension (predicate logic); Bayesian probability; Mathematics; Combinatorics; Computer science; Statistics; Artificial intelligence; Mathematical economics; Programming language,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12094,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2103.12094,,10.48550/arxiv.2103.12094,,,0,,0,true,,unknown

Sleep has been well established to play a role in the consolidation of newly learned information and schema-based information but has yet to be explored within mathematical cognition. Across three experiments participants (N = 152) were assigned to a sleep or wake condition and then viewed lectures on either p-values, t-test, or z-scores. The sleep condition watched the lecture at 9pm, completed an immediate recall task to explain the concept, then a second recall task 12h later at 9am. The wake conditions watched the lecture at 9am, completed an immediate recall task then a second recall task 12h later at 9pm. Written responses were then assessed using a comparative judgement task by subject experts. Across all three experiments, results showed that participants in the sleep condition retained their knowledge from the immediate recall to 12 hours later, while in the wake condition, participants’ knowledge declined significantly between sessions. These results suggest that sleep may be involved in an important process of maintenance of learned information of mathematical concepts.</p>",,,,,Recall; Schema (genetic algorithms); Cognition; Task (project management); Psychology; Judgement; Cognitive psychology; Computer science; Management; Neuroscience; Machine learning; Political science; Law; Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/3fhbk,,10.31234/osf.io/3fhbk,,,0,,0,true,,unknown

The importance of this chatbot is that it provides an information system perfectly matching with tourists' characteristics that are most likely accessing information while travelling or mobile. In other words, tourists need an information system with a good capability and flexibility in dialogical communication instead of querying information many times in any search engines. The methodology used is quantitative by conducting initial questionnaires with closed-ended questions and using non-probabilistic sampling (n=40). Later, we do several technical steps to build a knowledge base. The uniqueness of this proposal is that this chatbot will have a capability to display aggregate data about the comparative judgement of tourism sites made by the crowds. It is highly recommended to implement this proposed chatbot as it will give benefit to the visiting tourists as well as tourism sites' managements.

By now, however, there is no way to test the validity of corresponding assumptions, although this would be a key prerequisite to guarantee the meaningfulness of the results produced by an algorithm. In this paper, we investigate the problem of testing different forms of stochastic transitivity in an online manner. We derive lower bounds on the expected sample complexity of any sequential hypothesis testing algorithm for various forms of stochastic transitivity, thereby providing additional motivation to focus on weak stochastic transitivity. To this end, we introduce an algorithmic framework for the dueling bandits problem, in which the statistical validity of weak stochastic transitivity can be tested, either actively or passively, based on a multiple binomial hypothesis test. Moreover, by exploiting a connection between weak stochastic transitivity and graph theory, we suggest an enhancement to further improve the efficiency of the testing algorithm. In the active setting, both variants achieve an expected sample complexity that is optimal up to a logarithmic factor.",110,8,2063,2084,Preference learning; Pairwise comparison; Transitive relation; Key (cryptography); Logarithm; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Sequential analysis; Statistical hypothesis testing; Graph theory,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Universität Paderborn,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-021-06026-2 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10994-021-06026-2.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06026-2 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ml/ml110.html#HaddenhorstBH21,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-021-06026-2,,10.1007/s10994-021-06026-2,3177658582,,0,004-688-774-191-036; 010-132-302-334-522; 011-249-146-032-981; 012-193-218-098-506; 017-071-953-596-68X; 018-261-132-596-82X; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-526-803-476-474; 029-650-296-555-117; 031-176-114-356-499; 033-920-290-313-776; 037-600-550-489-747; 038-200-597-509-737; 043-377-513-771-848; 047-966-737-984-472; 050-943-988-713-681; 056-287-899-751-358; 067-762-546-777-826; 070-282-043-787-112; 071-291-385-477-211; 074-980-499-491-508; 075-221-671-585-75X; 080-783-146-391-370; 087-991-691-200-809; 102-059-313-837-093; 104-905-038-508-692; 105-342-287-734-148; 105-383-001-913-791; 134-439-485-894-444; 135-840-826-313-466; 135-953-051-832-80X; 141-610-819-810-580; 142-429-056-409-835; 148-580-191-560-087; 149-228-667-566-569; 155-595-284-868-270; 171-869-812-279-53X; 178-422-975-780-285; 187-756-118-148-249,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Comparative judgment is a method of assigning scores to (perceptions of) objects using paired comparisons. We use this method to explore the “ordinary meaning” of words, and the classic case of vehicles in the park in particular. We present an empirical study comprising three conditions. Given a pair of potential vehicles, participants were asked to judge either 1) the better example of a vehicle, 2) the worse violation of a sign that reads “no vehicles in the park”, or 3) the bigger nuisance in a park. We find that both the meaning of the wording of the rule and the intention behind it influence participants judgments of rule-violations, consistent with previous studies. More importantly, comparative judgment provides more fine-grained information about agreement and the weighted rankings of the potential vehicles than other methods, with widespread potential applications in experimental philosophy.KEYWORDS: Vehicles in the parkcomparative judgementexperimental philosophyordinary meaningexperimental jurisprudenceMethodology AcknowledgementsMany thanks to Glenn Anderau, Ethan Landes, Justin Sytsma, and our anonymous referees for feedback on this article.Disclosure statementNo potential conflict of interest was reported by the author(s).Notes1. Experimental jurisprudence involves the use of experimental methods to investigate theoretical questions about legal concepts, and the law and its applications (see Sommers, Citation2021; Tobia, Citation2022).2. Chartrand (Citation2022) provides a good, up-to-date overview of corpus methods in experimental philosophy.3. Further details of the debate between Hart and Fuller are given by Schauer (Citation2008).4. One thing to note is that this setup tests individual terms as examples of vehicles, but one possible textualist approach is to use sentence meaning rather than word meaning. One could argue, for example, that “vehicle” is used differently in the context of a sentence expressing a rule. The question then is whether this is due to sentence meaning or because the sentence provides insight into the intention of the rule. The results in Tobia’s (Citation2020) appendix (comparing experiments 1A and 1B) suggest the latter. Nonetheless, a textualist of this kind could object that our Vehicles condition only tracks word meaning and not sentence meaning, but they may nonetheless be interested in the contrast between the Violation and Nuisance conditions.5.

Traditionally, social moderation meetings were conducted face to face. Communication technologies and online scoring systems enable teachers, in any location, to engage in online social moderation (OSM). Reliability data from analytical marking and comparative judgement online scoring systems can inform teachers' understanding of what constitutes quality, and OSM serves to develop communities of judgement. The purpose of this study was to investigate if these systems support OSM outcomes, and if this approach was advantageous. In this paper, a model is presented that can be used by education policymakers to implement OSM. The model is an outcome of the third phase of a study that involved teachers from rural schools who used online scoring systems to assess senior secondary students' digitized portfolios and used communication technologies for the purpose of OSM.

Unpacking Teachers’ Assessment Practices,2021-04-26,2021,,,,,,Helena Isaksson Persson; Eva Hartell,"The tacit knowledge of recognizing quality in student work is difficult to explicate in words, concepts like gut feeling or intuition is sometimes used. Is it possible to reveal such knowledge? Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ) shows a high degree of consistency among teachers when assessing quality in student work. Central to the method is that judges assess the quality of student work and write a comment where their choices are justified. The ACJ procedure, combined with providing comments, makes the implicit ability of assessment to some extent explicit. In this paper, we explore possibilities to combine ACJ with Repertory Grid Technique (RGT) to make in-depth analysis of technology teachers’ assessment practice.  The theoretical framework of RGT follows the argument that we interpret our world based on our experiences and provides arguments for claiming that teachers with similar education and work experiences have shared values in their professional practice. Consequently, teachers’ agreement in assessments in the ACJ studies can be a result of shared experiences. This study is a follow-up of a previous study (Hartell, Isaksson Persson, Bartholomew & Strimel, 2018); reasoning will be further investigated and new insights on how to combine ACJ and RGT is reported in this paper.",28,2,181,187,Feeling; Mathematics education; Psychology; Consistency (negotiation); Repertory grid; Unpacking; Quality (business); Tacit knowledge; Argument; Creating shared value,,,,,https://journals.oslomet.no/index.php/techneA/article/view/4341,https://journals.oslomet.no/index.php/techneA/article/view/4341,,,3172741474,,0,046-358-409-087-654; 097-022-416-512-592; 097-113-411-579-361; 097-546-737-907-584; 107-096-746-639-636; 126-875-389-752-711; 148-543-968-456-439; 170-621-479-140-749,0,false,,

We found no effect of language skills or language assessment experience on the assessment task, but judges who had received formal language assessment training seemed to differ in their decisions from judges who had not received such training. However, the scores generated by the crowdsourced task exhibited a strong positive correlation with the rubric‐based scores provided with the learner corpus used.</jats:p>",72,3,853,885,Crowdsourcing; Rubric; Task (project management); Reliability (semiconductor); Psychology; Language proficiency; Computer science; Natural language processing; Language assessment; Artificial intelligence; Applied psychology; Mathematics education; World Wide Web; Physics; Management; Quantum mechanics; Economics; Power (physics),,,,Fonds De La Recherche Scientifique - FNRS,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12498,,10.1111/lang.12498,,,0,004-132-993-393-339; 012-466-457-382-046; 014-465-847-738-413; 015-156-307-052-864; 015-872-566-690-26X; 016-254-806-751-69X; 019-321-450-386-690; 020-728-994-827-773; 021-603-472-571-480; 022-151-126-855-01X; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-886-709-886-069; 024-803-242-844-573; 026-371-112-951-393; 028-559-561-363-287; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-966-099-589-64X; 040-446-356-101-353; 046-621-736-424-983; 048-091-210-665-560; 057-037-325-599-793; 078-459-706-995-898; 087-991-691-200-809; 092-758-774-465-036; 103-369-990-717-785; 107-563-400-054-796; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-659-660-814-933; 146-256-527-727-438; 148-673-033-661-432; 167-048-986-710-518,3,false,,

While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location's forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1)Â forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2)Â the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3)Â two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. We compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that were specifically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a Comparative Judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the visual communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.",,,,,Visualization; Aftershock; Readability; Computer science; Data visualization; Transparency (behavior); Task (project management); Data mining; Engineering; Computer security; Programming language; Civil engineering; Systems engineering,,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/articles/22/1499/2022/nhess-22-1499-2022.pdf https://doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac2,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac2,,10.5194/nhess-2021-237-ac2,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,hybrid
129-617-886-324-23X,Judgments in causal chains: The impact of positive and negative motives and outcomes on lay attributions,2021-11-14,2021,dissertation,,,Victoria University of Wellington Library,,Briar Helen Moir,"<jats:p>&lt;p&gt;Research on attributions about several events in causal chains has focused on chains ending in negative outcomes and has not examined positive outcomes and actions (e.g., Hilton, McClure, &amp; Sutton, 2010; Lagnado &amp; Channon, 2008; McClure, Hilton, &amp; Sutton, 2007). On the other hand, research on attributions for positive and negative events has examined judgments about one event in the chain and has not examined effects on other causes in the chain or made comparative judgments about physical causes that produce similar effects to actions (e.g., Alicke, 1992; Alicke, Rose, &amp; Bloom, 2011). This thesis integrates these two lines of research. Six studies examined judgments about two consecutive events (intentional actions and physical events) in chains leading to positive as well as negative outcomes. The intentional action was the same action (e.g. a man started a fire) that differed in motive (positive or negative). The physical event had the same causal effect as the action (e.g., a lightning strike started a fire), or was a physical event (e.g., strong wind) that occurred later in the causal chain.  The results replicate previous findings that when both actions and outcomes are negative, participants rate intentional actions more causal and blameworthy than physical events. However, when the intended outcomes fail to eventuate or positively motivated actions pre-empt positive outcomes, two distinct patterns emerged: A mismatch effect that explains the cause of the outcome; and a motive effect that explains judgments of culpability (measured by judgments of blame and punitiveness in these studies). Specifically, judgments of cause, responsibility, intentionality and foresight follow the same pattern that reflects the congruence between the valence of the agent‟s motive and the outcome. In contrast, judgments of culpability follow a different pattern where motive and outcome information have independent effects. Notably, it is the moral intent of actions that primarily determines judgments of culpability. The valence of the outcome plays a secondary role and amplifies ratings.  These results show that the important psychological and legal concepts of intentionality, abnormality, foresight, proximity, and outcome information are core determinants in lay attributions (e.g., Hart &amp; Honoré, 1985; Heider, 1958; Kelley, 1973; Weiner, 1995). But it is valence that plays the critical role in shaping lay reasoning. Several theoretical approaches applied in previous research on causal chains are examined, for example, Alicke's (2000) culpable control model, Tetlock's (2002) social functionalist model, and Spellman's (1997) crediting causality model. Yet none of the theories are able to account for the findings for chains that include positive actions or positive outcomes. The theoretical scope of this thesis was expanded in Study 6 to include research on the folk concept of intentionality, hindsight, and actor-observer biases (Fischhoff, 1975; Kashima, McKintyre, &amp; Clifford, 1998; Malle &amp; Knobe, 1997; Malle, Knobe, &amp; Nelson, 2007). The results are interpreted in terms of Sloman, Fernbach and Ewings' (2012) causal model of intentionality.&lt;/p&gt;</jats:p>",,,,,Attribution; Blame; Psychology; Causal chain; Social psychology; Action (physics); Event (particle physics); Outcome (game theory); Economics; Philosophy; Physics; Epistemology; Quantum mechanics; Mathematical economics,,,,,https://openaccess.wgtn.ac.nz/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566/1/files/31459861.pdf https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17006566 https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566/1/files/31459861.pdf https://figshare.com/articles/thesis/Judgments_in_causal_chains_The_impact_of_positive_and_negative_motives_and_outcomes_on_lay_attributions/17006566,http://dx.doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17006566,,10.26686/wgtn.17006566,,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

Zhang,"We consider the problem of ranking $n$ players from partial pairwise comparison data under the Bradley-Terry-Luce model. For the first time in the literature, the minimax rate of this ranking problem is derived with respect to the Kendall's tau distance that measures the difference between two rank vectors by counting the number of inversions. The minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition between an exponential rate and a polynomial rate depending on the magnitude of the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is unique to full ranking and has not been seen in any other statistical estimation problem. To achieve the minimax rate, we propose a divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm that first divides the $n$ players into groups of similar skills and then computes local MLE within each group. The optimality of the proposed algorithm is established by a careful approximate independence argument between the two steps.",,,,,Rank (linear algebra); Minimax; Exponential function; Pairwise comparison; Ranking (information retrieval); Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Independence (probability theory); Polynomial; Group (mathematics),,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08421.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08421 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210108421C/abstract http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08421,https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08421,,,3121377464,,0,010-492-501-069-476; 015-164-124-848-632; 015-981-703-064-218; 016-027-335-594-009; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-501-390-008-829; 026-406-973-799-802; 027-048-508-707-668; 027-408-896-252-090; 027-481-550-045-191; 027-896-243-015-499; 030-289-090-008-522; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-627-416-303-850; 047-307-839-107-965; 053-013-800-478-068; 055-894-748-477-45X; 056-717-302-816-604; 057-657-809-679-383; 075-539-693-388-757; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-131-898-512-375; 087-143-628-955-908; 088-081-068-281-719; 092-474-419-202-077; 094-630-349-889-33X; 095-172-407-515-485; 098-376-587-660-420; 109-668-006-494-690; 111-358-495-245-06X; 120-889-720-304-863; 121-442-560-587-280; 123-162-762-225-639; 126-998-030-149-801; 130-147-900-808-751; 139-649-897-193-545; 153-906-359-466-085; 158-229-170-355-898; 158-687-817-281-331; 161-247-307-055-667; 173-739-209-507-152; 185-191-807-545-399; 186-465-595-270-910; 187-579-971-923-156; 190-063-192-806-613; 195-685-864-553-865,3,true,,unknown

Ellis; Bertrand Perrat; James Goulding,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title>;                <jats:p>Identifying the most deprived regions of any country or city is key if policy makers are to design successful interventions. However, locating areas with the greatest need is often surprisingly challenging in developing countries. Due to the logistical challenges of traditional household surveying, official statistics can be slow to be updated; estimates that exist can be coarse, a consequence of prohibitive costs and poor infrastructures; and mass urbanization can render manually surveyed figures rapidly out-of-date. Comparative judgement models, such as the Bradley–Terry model, offer a promising solution. Leveraging local knowledge, elicited via comparisons of different areas’ affluence, such models can both simplify logistics and circumvent biases inherent to household surveys. Yet widespread adoption remains limited, due to the large amount of data existing approaches still require. We address this via development of a novel Bayesian Spatial Bradley–Terry model, which substantially decreases the number of comparisons required for effective inference. This model integrates a network representation of the city or country, along with assumptions of spatial smoothness that allow deprivation in one area to be informed by neighbouring areas. We demonstrate the practical effectiveness of this method, through a novel comparative judgement data set collected in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.</jats:p>",71,2,288,308,,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/rssc.12532,,10.1111/rssc.12532,,,0,005-932-334-805-223; 007-730-040-038-468; 016-178-367-287-757; 025-009-658-071-875; 031-947-903-216-926; 032-437-388-057-540; 036-409-676-801-378; 038-809-435-969-896; 039-840-281-745-428; 041-656-251-943-572; 045-385-799-151-523; 051-115-902-001-10X; 079-011-726-795-309; 090-377-685-413-507; 093-777-263-895-915; 120-210-781-620-559; 124-850-148-955-311; 150-403-233-423-828; 170-919-478-336-370; 179-538-270-782-863; 183-914-972-982-465; 195-564-794-414-606,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

However, exploration of a possible STEARC effect along the vertical axis has yielded mixed results. Here, in six experiments based on a novel paradigm, we systematically explored whether a STEARC effect could emerge when participants were asked to classify the actual temporal duration of a visual stimulus. Speeded manual responses were provided using a vertically oriented response box. Interestingly, although a top-to-bottom time representation emerged when only two temporal durations were employed, an inverted bottom-to-top time representation emerged when a denser set of temporal durations, arranged along a continuum, was used. Moreover, no STEARC effects emerged when participants classified the shapes of visual stimuli rather than their temporal duration. Finally, three additional experiments explored the STEARC effect along the horizontal axis, confirming that the paradigm we devised successfully replicated the standard left-to-right representation of time. These results provide supporting evidence for the notion that temporal durations can be mapped along the vertical axis, and that such mapping appears to be relatively flexible.",87,3,894,918,Vertical axis; Horizontal and vertical; Representation (politics); Stimulus (psychology); Computer science; Mathematics; Psychology; Geometry; Cognitive psychology; Politics; Political science; Law,,"Humans; Reaction Time/physiology; Time Perception/physiology; Orientation, Spatial; Standing Position; Space Perception/physiology",,Università degli Studi di Padova (SID DPSS 2019),https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00426-022-01693-9.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-022-01693-9,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-022-01693-9,35718808,10.1007/s00426-022-01693-9,,PMC10017642,0,000-182-707-085-774; 000-333-219-424-701; 000-455-372-559-296; 000-737-437-267-098; 002-745-729-428-036; 003-373-503-330-388; 004-308-482-437-762; 004-620-151-855-747; 004-731-905-838-794; 005-374-265-419-666; 005-549-656-666-826; 005-581-582-786-357; 006-411-533-512-231; 007-831-422-429-707; 011-021-940-448-844; 011-267-417-883-438; 012-991-433-197-458; 013-647-909-440-42X; 013-801-924-391-622; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-870-445-353-487; 016-014-603-732-883; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-096-212-135-705; 018-066-357-545-886; 018-270-745-810-002; 018-658-066-225-195; 021-158-563-662-772; 022-085-582-945-331; 023-559-517-247-674; 027-007-319-180-106; 027-536-422-691-08X; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-815-634-356-386; 032-237-252-273-598; 032-350-649-528-741; 032-513-351-835-400; 032-714-921-907-447; 033-587-230-195-089; 036-459-179-538-121; 037-557-645-369-763; 038-799-077-758-936; 039-722-117-248-289; 042-442-816-035-890; 044-786-461-439-846; 045-947-905-284-269; 045-965-362-317-923; 047-584-386-471-064; 049-725-492-962-923; 050-683-379-855-846; 050-788-897-973-181; 051-829-590-675-15X; 052-034-544-179-857; 053-756-966-193-449; 054-400-360-557-796; 058-739-699-740-467; 060-926-580-669-291; 061-215-565-452-575; 061-663-622-253-96X; 066-608-905-207-154; 066-705-546-684-50X; 066-930-114-500-122; 068-090-664-463-999; 068-177-440-517-494; 072-783-417-379-040; 077-882-055-430-712; 079-201-120-193-247; 083-964-506-871-063; 084-182-116-078-81X; 086-355-961-343-436; 088-583-249-675-792; 089-022-676-703-547; 089-953-015-050-96X; 090-989-429-837-914; 090-989-588-538-874; 092-715-514-577-680; 096-167-391-482-040; 096-209-541-509-919; 096-286-693-718-911; 096-358-961-285-957; 096-974-841-889-042; 101-140-214-364-341; 101-497-393-432-558; 109-394-703-333-926; 112-940-030-793-664; 115-345-786-114-230; 117-850-729-116-985; 123-174-408-429-661; 128-887-777-838-374; 135-030-832-649-447; 139-708-795-933-36X; 158-027-757-266-135; 167-275-555-617-549,10,true,cc-by,hybrid

Because not all of the participants had received two or more adequate trials of therapy with standard antidepressants in the current episode, the sample does not technically meet regulatory criteria for treatment-resistant depression but does represent the pool of depressed patients who are considered for second- or third-line treatment options. This paper is important for a number of reasons. First, MDD is a common and potentially disabling condition that is recognized as one of the world’s greatest public health problems (2–4). Second, although prompt recognition and vigorous treatment is inarguably the best strategy to reduce the profound suffering and illness burden attributable to MDD, many depressed people—perhaps up to 40%—do not respond to sequential trials of standard antidepressant medications (5, 6). As a result, people with more difficult-to-treat depressive episodes account for a disproportionately large share of the staggering socioeconomic costs associated with this illness (4), and the identification of safe and effective alternative treatment options for these patients continues to be a priority for treatment research (7). Third, because the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considered the results of this study to be pivotal in their recent review and approval of cariprazine for this indication (https://www.clinicaladvisor.com/general-medicine/top-december-2022-fda-approvals/), it behooves prescribers to be familiar with these data.Dating back to the publication of the main findings of the Sequenced Treatment Alternatives to Relieve Depression study (5), there has been steadily increasing use of adjunctive treatment strategies in lieu of simply switching to a different antidepressant medication. This change in practice patterns has no doubt been fostered by accumulating evidence that a number of SGAs are effective as adjuncts following nonresponse to selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors or other first-line antidepressants (8, 9). Perhaps of greatest relevance to our patients, adjunctive therapy with an SGA tends to be easier to implement than adopting switching strategies because there is no need for tapering the ineffective medication or cross-titration, and when the SGA is effective, clinically meaningful benefits are often observed within the first few weeks of therapy (8). Cariprazine is the fifth SGA to receive FDA approval as adjunctive therapy for MDD, joining two of the relatively older SGAs (olanzapine and quetiapine) and two SGAs (aripiprazole and brexpiprazole) that share dopamine partial agonism as a presumed mechanism of action. Similar to other SGAs when studied as adjunctive therapies (8), the antidepressant efficacy of adjunctive cariprazine is evident at about one-half of the dosage commonly used to treat mania or schizophrenia. In the trial of Sachs and colleagues, for example, efficacy was established in the group receiving 1.5 mg/day but not in the group receiving 3.0 mg/day. However, the actual difference in symptom improvement between the groups was negligible. In the other pivotal randomized controlled trial of adjunctive cariprazine therapy, patients receiving flexibly titrated therapy at 2.0–4.5 mg/day obtained significant improvement, whereas the group treated with 1.0–2.0 mg/day did not (9). Nevertheless, as lower adjunctive dosages of cariprazine are likely to result in better tolerability, dosages above 1.5 mg/day should be reserved for patients who have few side effects but insufficient benefit after 4–6 weeks of therapy.Much work remains to be done to establish the best place for cariprazine in our treatment algorithms and pharmacy benefit tiers. As is still the case with other SGAs when prescribed as adjuncts to antidepressants, the field requires better data on longer-term treatment outcomes to determine the optimal duration of therapy to achieve the desired efficacy. We also need more comprehensive safety data during longer-term therapy so that the risks of weight gain, other metabolic complications, and tardive dyskinesia can be more accurately gauged. Meanwhile, potential clinical characteristics that might differentiate cariprazine from other SGAs include a relatively novel mechanism of action, a low risk of significant weight gain, and a low rate of daytime sedation. Of course, cost-effectiveness will also be a concern, as branded formulations of SGAs are substantially more expensive than generically available alternatives. Therefore, a skeptic with an eye focused on pharmacy expenditures might ask “Do we really need another SGA approved for this indication?” I believe the answer is “yes” in part because individual differences in drug response make it useful to have more than one option within classes or subclasses of medications. Furthermore, assessments of cost-effectiveness are ephemeral as the time period for market exclusivity is relatively short-lived. Although data from head-to-head randomized controlled trials are ultimately needed to make more precise comparative judgments of benefits, risks, and cost-effectiveness, FDA approval of cariprazine for adjunctive treatment of MDD is a welcome step in treatment development.Department of Psychiatry, Perelman School of Medicine of the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia.Send correspondence to Dr. Thase ([email protected]).Dr. Thase has served as an adviser or consultant for Acadia, Akili, Alkermes, Allergan (Forest, Naurex), Boehringer-Ingelheim, Clexio Biosciences, H.

Therefore, $ D $-optimal designs are only locally optimal in the parameter space. This dependence renders the optimization problem very difficult, as standard theory encodes $ D $-optimality in systems of highly nonlinear equations and inequalities. In this work, we connect design theory for discrete choice experiments with Laplacian matrices of connected graphs. We rewrite the $ D $-optimality criterion in terms of Laplacians via Kirchhoff's matrix tree theorem, and show that its dual has a simple description via the Cayley--Menger determinant of the Farris transform of the Laplacian matrix. This results in a drastic reduction of complexity and allows us to implement a gradient descent algorithm to find locally $ D $-optimal designs. For the subclass of Bradley--Terry paired comparison models, we find a direct link to maximum likelihood estimation for Laplacian-constrained Gaussian graphical models. This implies that every locally $ D $-optimal design is a rational function in the parameter when the design is supported on a chordal graph. Finally, we study the performance of our algorithm and demonstrate its application on real and simulated data.",,,,,Mathematics; Laplacian matrix; Mathematical optimization; Laplace operator; Matrix (chemical analysis); Gradient descent; Applied mathematics; Graph; Computer science; Discrete mathematics; Artificial neural network; Mathematical analysis; Materials science; Machine learning; Composite material,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08926,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2208.08926,,10.48550/arxiv.2208.08926,,,0,,0,true,,green

Comparative judgements indicate that the apparent numerosity of the lower contrast disks is unaffected by being intermingled with high contrast disks, whereas the high contrast disks are <i>reduced</i> in numerosity by being intermingled with the low contrast ones (Lei and Reeves, 2018). Here, we report that this illusion also occurs for absolute judgements of the numerosities of displays of from 20 to 80 disks. A model based on luminance-difference contrast normalization (LDCN) explains the illusory loss of high-contrast (salient) items along with veridical perception of the low-contrast ones.

Respondents everywhere distinguish preventing harm to foreign citizens, which almost all support, from redistributing resources, which only about half support. These two dimensions of moral cosmopolitanism, equitable security (preventing harm) and equitable benefits (redistributing resources), predict attitudes toward contested international policies, actual charitable donations, and preferences for mask and vaccine allocations in the COVID-19 response. The dimensions do not reflect several demographic variables and only weakly reflect political ideology. Moral cosmopolitanism also differs from related psychological constructs such as group identity. Finally, to understand the underlying thought structures, natural language processing reveals cognitive associations underlying moral cosmopolitanism (e.g., world, both) versus the alternative, parochial moral mindset (e.g., USA, first). Making these global or local terms accessible introduces an effective intervention that at least temporarily leads more people to behave like moral cosmopolitans.",118,40,,,Political economy; Collective identity; Ideology; Political science; Morality; Cosmopolitanism; Harm; Mindset; Intervention (law); Politics,cognitive processes; cosmopolitanism; intergroup morality; public policy,Humans; Internationality; Judgment; Linguistics; Morals; Psychological Theory; Public Policy; Resource Allocation; Safety; Surveys and Questionnaires,,World Bank Group; Princeton University; Princeton University; Princeton University,https://collaborate.princeton.edu/en/publications/cosmopolitan-morality-trades-off-in-group-for-the-world-separatin https://www.pnas.org/content/118/40/e2100991118 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34580214 https://search.bvsalud.org/global-literature-on-novel-coronavirus-2019-ncov/resource/en/covidwho-1440509 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34580214/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8501851,http://dx.doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2100991118,34580214,10.1073/pnas.2100991118,3203090184,PMC8501851,0,001-487-709-598-016; 006-838-214-720-925; 009-031-415-331-32X; 011-609-048-469-65X; 016-040-641-845-087; 016-667-942-692-01X; 016-836-973-939-796; 018-379-952-039-571; 020-233-034-340-074; 022-304-130-907-171; 027-117-231-955-381; 027-477-835-975-876; 028-234-053-759-968; 029-236-778-491-239; 030-585-773-311-121; 031-076-409-481-686; 032-346-243-828-582; 036-477-226-164-927; 046-456-720-430-661; 047-805-437-343-385; 048-390-970-337-56X; 051-749-492-473-589; 052-528-561-620-173; 053-094-537-530-97X; 053-549-701-618-024; 053-656-240-101-80X; 056-178-060-423-559; 057-498-691-539-450; 063-003-086-400-485; 063-261-153-739-991; 063-964-787-077-775; 074-237-223-746-660; 076-394-620-787-388; 076-961-339-149-155; 078-821-465-894-074; 079-708-892-737-067; 080-065-233-945-347; 081-095-489-885-433; 085-719-873-172-831; 088-003-641-752-648; 096-399-262-478-988; 096-830-971-000-034; 097-068-971-161-799; 102-650-886-928-353; 113-963-854-963-417; 115-891-977-840-866; 120-922-676-458-188; 121-799-924-246-172; 141-122-234-851-077; 144-000-291-644-879; 149-870-096-763-89X; 165-901-614-444-733; 173-268-986-853-991; 173-478-016-789-920; 193-938-805-551-325; 194-038-284-169-990,2,true,,unknown

It is a question, using the stylistic approach, of showing the role that this discourse plays in a literary text. Indeed, writers such as Chinua Achebe, Seydou Badian, Amadou Hampaté Bâ, Ahmadou Kourouma, Sembene Ousmane, Ngugi Wa Thiong'o and Henri Lopes employ proverbial discourse with metaphorical, comparative, judgmental, ethical and satirical effects not only to embellish romantic stories by their figurative and pictorial meaning, but also and above all to ensure a playful and didactic function in the training of individuals. The insertion of this discourse in the literary text reflects the influence of civilization, better of orality in Negro-African literature. Thus, its use appears as a sign of maturity or culture.  Keywords : proverbial discourse, african writer, stylistic effect, study, literary text.</jats:p>",1,2,89,100,Orality; Meaning (existential); Literature; Sign (mathematics); Romance; Comics; Art; Philosophy; Sociology; Literacy; Mathematical analysis; Pedagogy; Mathematics; Epistemology,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.55595/m2022,,10.55595/m2022,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

However, this phase is often ignored by most decision makers. For the evaluation of complex product design concepts, experts are selected by clusters with different backgrounds. This work proposes a novel integrated two-layer method to determine expert weight under these circumstances. In the first layer, a hybrid model integrated by the entropy weight model and the Multiplicative analytical hierarchy process method is presented. In the second layer, a minimized variance model is applied to reach a consensus. Then the final expert weight is determined by the results of both layers. A real-life example of cruise ship cabin design evaluation is implemented to demonstrate the proposed expert weight determination method. To analyze the feasibility of the proposed method, weight determination with and without using experts is compared. The result shows the expert weight determination method is an effective approach to improve the accuracy of design concept evaluation.",12,1,6358,,Computer science; Analytic hierarchy process; Expert system; Multiplicative function; Entropy (arrow of time); Variance (accounting); Process (computing); Flexibility (engineering); Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Operations research; Mathematics; Statistics; Mathematical analysis; Physics; Accounting; Quantum mechanics; Business; Operating system,,Consensus; Entropy; Research Design,,"Culture and Tourism Research Project of Shandong Province, China; The Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province, China; The Key Research and Development Plan of Shandong Province, China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China; Natural Science Foundation of Shandong Province, China; High-tech Ship project of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology, China",https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-022-10333-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10333-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/s41598-022-10333-6,35428829,10.1038/s41598-022-10333-6,,PMC9012764,0,007-180-894-189-012; 008-452-227-229-722; 009-120-014-895-372; 010-127-989-765-372; 013-243-964-039-937; 015-235-131-776-791; 017-767-927-384-646; 022-058-831-865-209; 030-231-317-072-683; 036-931-483-015-591; 037-423-792-391-123; 039-454-880-922-523; 039-816-599-685-509; 039-835-912-198-592; 040-977-435-701-034; 041-535-535-898-004; 043-858-824-232-718; 046-231-242-869-559; 047-321-877-806-477; 049-969-971-355-793; 051-569-654-752-006; 052-411-856-163-96X; 060-872-533-072-512; 063-385-855-292-842; 063-633-482-276-371; 065-585-548-451-494; 066-873-216-356-207; 071-133-560-435-85X; 075-897-445-880-451; 084-165-299-715-943; 084-939-131-096-751; 086-013-844-179-171; 088-557-185-023-963; 088-868-810-736-618; 089-068-706-964-718; 090-615-811-544-956; 093-910-729-353-799; 096-672-726-705-187; 108-110-362-375-082; 114-455-383-710-848; 116-512-779-916-771; 117-299-894-861-565; 119-905-779-968-500; 127-141-206-585-644; 128-881-570-553-358; 132-309-083-908-294; 142-062-402-407-149; 142-501-553-929-536; 143-888-344-035-005; 145-619-194-364-686; 152-879-398-844-336; 162-221-953-656-038; 171-145-990-989-098; 175-908-382-390-063,17,true,cc-by,gold

New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 1976). Obtaining insight about the contribution of <jats:italic>specific</jats:italic> exploration activities to the originality of arts products is important for designing and supporting learning in arts education. The aim of this study is to examine the contribution of activities within three types of exploration: <jats:italic>association</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>combination</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>abstraction</jats:italic> to originality of visual arts designs. Data consist of 196 portfolio events showing exploration activities and art designs, from 11 Grade 11 visual arts students. Portfolio events were coded for three different types of exploration: <jats:italic>association</jats:italic>, <jats:italic>combination</jats:italic>, and <jats:italic>abstraction</jats:italic>, on a dimension of ascending <jats:italic>abstractness</jats:italic>. We coded activities within each of these types, on a scale of <jats:italic>remoteness</jats:italic>, to determine the metaphorical distance. Visual originality of each portfolio event was assessed using the comparative judgment method. Multilevel regression analyses showed all three types of exploration significantly contributed to originality of visual designs. In total, 31% of the variance in originality at portfolio events level was explained by these types of exploration. In general, the more <jats:italic>remote</jats:italic> exploration activities were, the more <jats:italic>original</jats:italic> the visual design.

Previous work suggests that feeling thankful implies some kind of comparative judgment. Given that downward social comparison and downward counterfactual thinking share many similarities, we assumed that both types of comparative thinking would be related to increases in adolescents’ levels of state gratitude. Two scenario-based studies conducted on Romanian high school students are reported. In Study 1, participants read vignettes depicting daily life events which resulted in small benefits for the main characters. Relative to the control group, adolescents in downward social comparison and downward counterfactual thinking conditions felt more grateful and estimated that the benefit was more valuable. In Study 2, we used a pretest–posttest design to test the same hypotheses and to examine whether the experimental manipulation could also be linked to increases in negative affect. Results show that after engaging in downward comparative thinking, participants reported more gratitude, as well as decreased levels of negative emotion. In both studies, the relation between downward comparative thinking and state gratitude was mediated by the perceived value of the benefit. These findings draw attention to the relative nature of gratitude, by pointing to the fact that it can be easily influenced by changes in the reference point with which one compares oneself.",22,8,1,28,Counterfactual thinking; Feeling; Positive psychology; Nothing; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Value (ethics); Test (assessment); Gratitude; Social psychology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-021-00382-5 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10902-021-00423-z.pdf,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10902-021-00382-5,,,3137499767,,0,000-431-789-451-604; 000-879-121-608-785; 000-934-263-826-496; 003-111-035-592-589; 003-871-820-986-710; 004-569-538-100-014; 004-786-199-308-363; 005-064-398-881-471; 014-135-608-640-580; 015-605-437-100-749; 017-573-711-485-880; 018-261-032-145-247; 019-765-437-678-506; 021-457-065-632-714; 023-288-914-618-377; 026-356-285-697-48X; 027-095-674-691-747; 030-083-160-445-40X; 032-049-177-406-929; 034-201-594-248-120; 034-314-212-828-586; 034-332-007-441-517; 034-736-994-010-809; 035-344-905-266-604; 035-550-214-787-643; 036-780-314-286-416; 040-706-960-873-622; 041-609-886-847-099; 042-105-825-447-785; 042-489-231-019-236; 042-772-064-503-226; 042-824-798-079-673; 042-889-952-786-577; 043-135-942-475-738; 045-132-384-862-264; 046-738-379-684-398; 048-504-754-030-945; 049-975-266-067-818; 050-291-970-858-048; 050-553-552-923-377; 051-299-719-707-250; 052-987-900-949-508; 056-115-464-979-029; 057-455-942-793-649; 060-351-252-759-525; 060-594-470-359-69X; 061-430-800-168-622; 061-845-196-202-920; 061-923-350-710-44X; 062-006-069-451-552; 062-752-440-108-113; 063-282-146-247-529; 065-671-000-434-200; 066-134-750-021-993; 067-118-508-511-376; 067-234-066-744-495; 069-782-847-210-437; 070-173-391-803-606; 073-206-508-628-184; 074-970-679-519-919; 078-360-282-929-773; 080-101-068-115-037; 082-006-859-974-337; 083-296-528-526-905; 083-681-183-146-368; 084-507-297-495-411; 086-766-684-700-71X; 089-298-837-389-569; 092-996-407-452-720; 093-895-479-543-414; 096-214-223-378-18X; 097-526-778-678-134; 105-279-219-660-918; 111-969-524-673-606; 112-184-186-111-243; 112-430-416-012-832; 113-398-442-111-796; 118-011-271-940-874; 129-703-492-918-474; 133-497-225-794-93X; 134-413-976-668-075; 138-721-815-811-440; 141-497-299-068-316; 161-791-837-854-967; 162-604-612-598-667; 169-000-115-287-494; 170-800-981-851-021; 171-822-467-315-879; 173-419-124-933-643; 180-070-337-062-073; 183-713-093-777-317,1,false,,

In this paper, I address these questions by exploring probabilistic measures of explanatory power in order to defend a particular Bayesian account of explanatory goodness. Critical to this discussion is a distinction between weak and strong measures of explanatory power due to Good (Br J Philos Sci 19:123-143, 1968). In particular, I argue that if one is interested in the overall goodness of an explanation, an appropriate balance needs to be struck between the weak explanatory power and the complexity of a hypothesis. In light of this, I provide a new defence of a strong measure proposed by Good by providing new derivations of it, comparing it with other measures and exploring its connection with information, confirmation and explanatory virtues. Furthermore, Good really presented a family of strong measures, whereas I draw on a complexity criterion that favours a specific measure and hence provides a more precise way to quantify explanatory goodness.",201,2,53,,Philosophy of language; Philosophy of science; Metaphysics; Epistemology; Philosophy,Bayesian; Confirmation; Explanation; Explanatory goodness; Explanatory power; Information,,,John Templeton Foundation,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-022-04025-x.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-04025-x https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/ws/files/113687115/11229_2022_Article_4025.pdf https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/files/113687115/11229_2022_Article_4025.pdf https://pure.ulster.ac.uk/en/publications/2b3be8dd-05bc-47e4-a421-9696bb587aad,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-022-04025-x,36748080,10.1007/s11229-022-04025-x,,PMC9895044,0,000-931-401-598-740; 007-011-243-938-57X; 007-796-852-675-35X; 008-574-874-041-57X; 009-340-887-011-34X; 016-844-293-393-785; 018-312-899-454-496; 018-930-083-768-837; 029-554-831-754-792; 029-733-545-433-756; 033-081-860-264-968; 033-168-513-115-046; 033-569-020-241-009; 033-651-102-297-287; 037-333-749-102-243; 044-800-420-240-601; 047-484-556-618-818; 048-224-914-886-034; 050-191-293-073-105; 054-687-557-680-772; 059-996-900-937-514; 061-841-551-091-041; 065-770-756-545-043; 075-171-387-772-993; 080-931-039-436-096; 084-183-959-302-853; 094-748-730-496-387; 100-502-051-454-922; 112-173-250-504-399; 117-258-077-383-953; 119-699-527-416-596; 121-245-238-432-704; 134-500-635-904-485; 142-779-696-666-733; 169-457-292-842-874; 172-383-229-625-008; 190-216-869-782-583,1,true,cc-by,hybrid
143-181-553-263-320,The Accuracy and Validity of the Simplified Pairs Method of Comparative Judgement in Highly Structured Papers,2022-04-28,2022,journal article,Frontiers in Education,2504284x,Frontiers Media SA,,Tony Leech; Tim Gill; Sarah Hughes; Tom Benton,"<jats:p>Comparative judgement (CJ) is often said to be more suitable for judging exam questions inviting extended responses, as it is easier for judges to make holistic judgements on a small number of large, extended tasks than a large number of smaller tasks. On the other hand, there is evidence it may also be appropriate for judging responses to papers made up of many smaller structured tasks. We report on two CJ exercises on mathematics and science exam papers, which are constructed mainly of highly structured items. This is to explore whether judgements processed by the simplified pairs version of CJ can approximate the empirical difference in difficulty of pairs of papers. This can then be used to maintain standards between exam papers. This use of CJ, not its other use as an alternative to marking, is the focus of this paper. Within the exercises discussed, panels of experienced judges looked at pairs of scripts, from different sessions of the same test, and their judgements were processed <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> the simplified pairs CJ method. This produces a single figure for the estimated difference in difficulty between versions. We compared this figure to the difference obtained from traditional equating, used as a benchmark. In the mathematics study the difference derived from judgement <jats:italic>via</jats:italic> simplified pairs closely approximated the empirical equating difference. However, in science, the CJ outcome did not closely align with the empirical difference in difficulty. Reasons for the discrepancy may include the differences in the content of the exams or the specific judges. However, clearly, comparative judgement need not lead to an accurate impression of the relative difficulty of different exams. We discuss self-reported judge views on how they judged, including what questions they focused on, and the implications of these for the validity of CJ. Processes used when judging papers made up of highly structured tasks were varied, but judges were generally consistent enough. Some potential challenges to the validity of comparative judgement are present with judges sometimes using re-marking strategies, and sometimes focusing attention on subsets of the paper, and we explore these. A greater understanding of what judges are doing when they judge comparatively brings to the fore questions of judgement validity that remain implicit in marking and non-comparative judgement contexts.</jats:p>",7,,,,Judgement; Equating; Benchmark (surveying); Significant difference; Empirical research; Focus (optics); Computer science; Psychology; Mathematics education; Mean difference; Mathematics; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive psychology; Statistics; Rasch model; Epistemology; Confidence interval; Philosophy; Physics; Geodesy; Optics; Geography,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2022.803040/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.803040 https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/ad31debc-8619-4832-8062-49c157fd79f7/download https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/337064,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2022.803040,,10.3389/feduc.2022.803040,,,0,012-834-407-111-308; 017-792-980-099-478; 039-016-341-796-150; 040-260-471-060-547; 046-885-708-774-897; 047-593-198-756-593; 064-879-962-697-761; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-498-589-296-279; 087-991-691-200-809; 094-726-613-746-351; 148-673-033-661-432; 170-760-456-367-609,2,true,cc-by,gold

Understanding the interplay between expertise and memory is therefore critical. Across two experiments, we tested fingerprint examiners and novices on their visual short-term memory for fingerprints. In Experiment 1, experts showed substantially higher memory performance compared to novices for fingerprints from their domain of expertise. In Experiment 2, we manipulated print distinctiveness and found that while both groups benefited from distinctive prints, experts still outperformed novices. This indicates that beyond stimulus qualities, expertise itself enhances short-term memory, likely through more effective organisational processing and sensitivity to meaningful patterns. Taken together, these findings shed light on the cognitive mechanisms that may explain fingerprint examiners' superior memory performance within their domain of expertise. They further suggest that training to improve memory for diverse fingerprints could practically boost examiner performance.

143-918-082-720-524,Estimating and Using Block Information in the Thurstonian IRT Model.,2023-08-28,2023,journal article,Psychometrika,18600980; 00333123,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Canada,Susanne Frick,"Multidimensional forced-choice (MFC) tests are increasing in popularity but their construction is complex. The Thurstonian item response model (Thurstonian IRT model) is most often used to score MFC tests that contain dominance items. Currently, in a frequentist framework, information about the latent traits in the Thurstonian IRT model is computed for binary outcomes of pairwise comparisons, but this approach neglects stochastic dependencies. In this manuscript, it is shown how to estimate Fisher information on the block level. A simulation study showed that the observed and expected standard errors based on the block information were similarly accurate. When local dependencies for block sizes [Formula: see text] were neglected, the standard errors were underestimated, except with the maximum a posteriori estimator. It is shown how the multidimensional block information can be summarized for test construction. A simulation study and an empirical application showed small differences between the block information summaries depending on the outcome considered. Thus, block information can aid the construction of reliable MFC tests.",88,4,1556,1589,Block (permutation group theory); Estimator; Pairwise comparison; Item response theory; Statistics; Fisher information; Econometrics; Computerized adaptive testing; Computer science; Mathematics; Psychometrics; Geometry,Thurstonian IRT model; automated test assembly; information; multidimensional forced-choice; standard errors,Psychometrics; Computer Simulation,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (2277),https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11336-023-09931-8.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11336-023-09931-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-023-09931-8,37640828,10.1007/s11336-023-09931-8,,PMC10656335,0,004-095-683-100-342; 004-414-436-917-174; 006-798-238-694-684; 007-059-417-911-872; 010-221-323-940-921; 011-482-312-788-313; 011-892-783-110-009; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-782-323-268-146; 012-945-930-608-257; 013-165-528-629-868; 013-804-747-650-091; 015-220-147-709-356; 016-145-543-486-747; 016-926-000-460-104; 017-504-153-087-087; 017-951-099-078-298; 019-445-173-019-335; 023-435-015-300-311; 026-299-662-314-408; 032-171-661-043-68X; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-471-680-269-085; 050-701-869-637-24X; 052-397-076-483-024; 054-594-383-964-19X; 055-587-036-740-547; 056-804-957-814-795; 057-680-486-150-543; 058-339-122-822-756; 061-988-856-186-902; 064-378-036-862-961; 065-130-290-645-468; 068-421-142-040-036; 068-664-176-406-944; 077-082-389-379-595; 078-683-211-362-948; 079-646-550-056-48X; 087-177-239-821-127; 089-709-833-029-631; 091-927-464-409-897; 098-216-417-129-861; 100-780-024-714-194; 102-106-279-287-612; 108-421-428-899-312; 113-184-123-590-319; 113-522-904-549-801; 115-583-498-567-968; 120-445-691-959-694; 121-948-750-134-045; 129-607-897-680-652; 141-562-203-874-638; 141-632-591-403-07X; 147-480-502-678-329; 163-461-810-749-199; 187-775-685-917-474; 198-673-330-714-442,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

A hundred thirty-eight participants (mean age ​= ​22.7 ​yrs; SD ​= ​1.9) with normal visual acuity and color vision were evaluated. Additional 225 children were also evaluated (mean age ​= ​8,9yrs; SD ​= ​2.3). The task consisted of writing a list of the one-term word for colors and data were analyzed based on Thurstone's rank order scaling method. For adults, the most salient concept was blue and the less was violet with a distance for concepts of 3.51 units between them, whereas for children the most salient concept was blue and the less was violet with a distance for concepts of 3.67 units between them. Significant differences between adults and children occurred for white, brown, pink, orange, gray, and violet. The internal consistency of our measurement was lower than 0.1% for almost all colors which suggests high reliability for both age groups, except for brown and anil in children. Thus, our innovative approach produces quantitative interval class data rather than categorical or ordinal data allowing quantitative measurement of the amount of the concept salience on a one-dimensional scale, feasible to be used for adults and children.",5,,100077,,Statistics; Salience (neuroscience); Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Interval class; Interval Scale; Mathematics; Categorical variable; Color vision; Ordinal data,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2590260121000345,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.metip.2021.100077,,10.1016/j.metip.2021.100077,3201563470,,0,000-399-257-971-716; 006-247-861-741-023; 010-219-697-712-867; 013-578-934-348-856; 016-926-000-460-104; 017-422-516-426-553; 018-353-778-316-338; 021-036-278-682-525; 021-916-340-178-246; 022-292-668-381-17X; 023-487-763-366-978; 024-322-550-847-138; 024-848-286-367-819; 026-744-885-253-107; 027-724-585-127-705; 028-540-634-323-172; 029-291-085-676-195; 029-564-720-318-989; 029-652-453-589-345; 030-550-752-425-410; 032-262-103-096-561; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-046-082-430-814; 043-253-557-307-866; 047-302-282-514-404; 047-610-393-003-580; 047-613-017-049-773; 051-427-898-969-347; 052-506-463-529-483; 053-215-132-118-766; 068-483-671-915-532; 069-842-315-866-71X; 071-580-002-350-354; 072-222-453-778-815; 076-749-541-776-875; 077-457-454-976-635; 081-187-244-438-262; 083-143-248-789-64X; 087-129-771-482-479; 091-666-780-893-50X; 099-778-804-373-865; 101-012-754-819-62X; 105-731-530-375-800; 106-777-151-946-597; 107-985-808-076-833; 122-816-671-716-436; 139-521-212-956-632; 139-679-021-329-089; 142-832-482-864-902; 156-017-512-078-855; 156-472-140-009-561; 195-720-248-982-384,0,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

Clinicians discern more details than contained in scales, for example, when assessing radiographs, but clinicians’ distinctions are often based on experience-based rules of thumb, that is, heuristics. The objectives of this study are to compare clinicians’ heuristic assessments to ordinal grading, to identify case elements that influence clinicians’ judgements and to present a method for quantifying heuristic assessments. Design Clinicians were presented with 17 207 random pairs from a set of 1087 knee radiographs. For each pair, the radiograph with more severe osteoarthritis was selected. The Bradley-Terry model was used to calculate an osteoarthritis strength parameter for each radiograph. Similarly, strength parameters were determined for 12 morphological features with five additional features being considered either present or absent. All radiographs were also graded according to conventional ordinal systems (Kellgren-Lawrence and Ahlback). Relations between clinicians’ judgements and (1) the heuristics-based osteoarthritis strength, (2) conventional ordinal systems and (3) morphological features were investigated. Results Receiver operating characteristic analysis showed that the Bradley-Terry model provided a good description of clinicians’ assessments (area under the curve (AUC)=0.97, 95% CI 0.968 to 0.972). Morphological features (AUC=0.90, 95% CI 0.900 to 0.908) provided a superior description of clinicians’ choices compared with conventional ordinal systems (AUC=0.88, 95% CI 0.878 to 0.887 and AUC=0.80, 95% CI 0.796 to 0.809) for Ahlback and Kellgren-Lawrence, respectively). The features most strongly associated with osteoarthritis strength were medial joint space width, flattening of the medial femoral and tibial condyles, medial osteophytes and alignment. Conclusions Heuristics-based assessments give a better distinction than conventional grading systems of knee osteoarthritis. The example presents a general approach to evaluate which features are part of experts’ heuristics. The data suggest that experts discern more details than included in conventional ordinal grading systems. Quantitative heuristic assessments may replace ordinal scales.",11,3,e041793,,Heuristics; Grading (education); Heuristic; Osteoarthritis; Orthodontics; Kellgren lawrence; Radiography; Medicine; Exploratory research; Rule of thumb,diagnostic radiology; knee; musculoskeletal disorders; radiology & imaging; statistics & research methods,"Heuristics; Humans; Knee Joint/diagnostic imaging; Matched-Pair Analysis; Osteoarthritis, Knee/diagnostic imaging; Radiography",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7942253 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34006025/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/34006025 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/11/3/e041793 https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/bmjopen/11/3/e041793.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041793,34006025,10.1136/bmjopen-2020-041793,3133570083,PMC7942253,0,001-271-662-535-073; 005-126-133-321-234; 005-553-153-856-945; 008-433-687-728-182; 009-188-129-583-580; 010-430-891-778-388; 010-469-379-791-696; 013-532-361-072-456; 016-797-585-713-198; 018-269-445-638-29X; 024-848-286-367-819; 026-382-368-418-377; 026-753-985-713-697; 031-019-321-127-016; 031-779-699-577-483; 036-793-155-661-954; 051-285-523-102-076; 051-470-497-254-74X; 060-493-015-131-893; 064-238-105-598-822; 065-637-124-423-715; 071-566-942-751-480; 073-225-073-498-766; 080-732-390-831-26X; 096-030-195-190-721; 098-950-277-295-601; 115-641-513-672-92X; 116-014-265-671-955; 127-536-738-921-692; 148-223-435-969-407; 158-564-422-376-125; 160-928-885-215-092,4,true,"CC BY, CC BY-NC, CC BY-NC-ND",gold

  Crowdworkers and Comparative Judgement",2023-05-22,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Owen Henkel; Libby Hills,"Machine Learning models have many potentially beneficial applications in education settings, but a key barrier to their development is securing enough data to train these models. Labelling educational data has traditionally relied on highly skilled raters using complex, multi-class rubrics, making the process expensive and difficult to scale. An alternative, more scalable approach could be to use non-expert crowdworkers to evaluate student work, however, maintaining sufficiently high levels of accuracy and inter-rater reliability when using non-expert workers is challenging. This paper reports on two experiments investigating using non-expert crowdworkers and comparative judgement to evaluate complex student data. Crowdworkers were hired to evaluate student responses to open-ended reading comprehension questions. Crowdworkers were randomly assigned to one of two conditions: the control, where they were asked to decide whether answers were correct or incorrect (i.e., a categorical judgement), or the treatment, where they were shown the same question and answers, but were instead asked to decide which of two candidate answers was more correct (i.e., a comparative/preference-based judgement). We found that using comparative judgement substantially improved inter-rater reliability on both tasks. These results are in-line with well-established literature on the benefits of comparative judgement in the field of educational assessment, as well as with recent trends in artificial intelligence research, where comparative judgement is becoming the preferred method for providing human feedback on model outputs when working with non-expert crowdworkers. However, to our knowledge, these results are novel and important in demonstrating the beneficial effects of using the combination of comparative judgement and crowdworkers to evaluate educational data.",,,,,Judgement; Computer science; Scale (ratio); Reliability (semiconductor); Field (mathematics); Categorical variable; Process (computing); Artificial intelligence; Data science; Machine learning; Power (physics); Physics; Mathematics; Quantum mechanics; Political science; Pure mathematics; Law; Operating system,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.12894,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2305.12894,,10.48550/arxiv.2305.12894,,,0,,0,true,,green

Ashley Steel; Nadine Fleischhut,"Abstract. Earthquake models can produce aftershock forecasts, which have recently been released to lay audiences following large earthquakes. While visualization literature suggests that displaying forecast uncertainty can improve how forecast maps are used, research on uncertainty visualization is missing from earthquake science. We designed a pre-registered online experiment to test the effectiveness of three visualization techniques for displaying aftershock forecast maps and their uncertainty. These maps showed the forecasted number of aftershocks at each location for a week following a hypothetical mainshock, along with the uncertainty around each location’s forecast. Three different uncertainty visualizations were produced: (1) forecast and uncertainty maps adjacent to one another; (2) the forecast map depicted in a color scheme, with the uncertainty shown by the transparency of the color; and (3) two maps that showed the lower and upper bounds of the forecast distribution at each location. Unlike previous experiments, we compared the three uncertainty visualizations using tasks that are systematically designed to address broadly applicable and user-generated communication goals. We compared task responses between participants using uncertainty visualizations and using the forecast map shown without its uncertainty (the current practice). Participants completed two map-reading tasks that targeted several dimensions of the readability of uncertainty visualizations. Participants then performed a comparative judgment task, which demonstrated whether a visualization was successful in reaching two key communication goals: indicating where many aftershocks and no aftershocks are likely (sure bets) and where the forecast is low but the uncertainty is high enough to imply potential risk (surprises). All visualizations performed equally well in the goal of communicating sure bet situations. But the visualization with lower and upper bounds was substantially better than the other designs at communicating surprises. These results have implications for the communication of forecast uncertainty both within and beyond earthquake science.",,,1,39,Data mining; Creative visualization; Aftershock; Readability; Task (project management); Color scheme; Potential risk; Visualization; Computer science; Transparency (graphic),,,,,https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2021-237/ https://nhess.copernicus.org/preprints/nhess-2021-237/nhess-2021-237.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5194/nhess-2021-237,,10.5194/nhess-2021-237,3196689365,,0,,0,true,cc-by,green

I myself would disagree with such a holding by the Court. An important variable in resolving the issue for oneself is how much continuing precedential weight one should give to Pollock v. Farmers’ Loan &amp; Trust Co.—a case that itself blatantly disrespected precedent, but that did so more than a century ago, and that (on the other hand) some argue has already ceased to be good law. The principle of respecting precedent both has instrumental value and has been long (if fitfully) honoured within the American legal system, but all agree that its weight is not absolute.</jats:p><jats:p>An unapportioned minimum income tax on the wealthiest Americans that included in income their unrealized capital gains would likely be constitutional under currently prevalent legal doctrine. It is true, however, that Eisner v. Macomber (1920), if it were held to remain good law beyond its immediate facts, would support holding it unconstitutional. The prospect that the current Supreme Court’s six right-wingers will decide to revive Macomber provides only one reason for suspecting that they might strike down such a provision, perhaps while also launching a broader constitutional war against central tenets of the current regime for taxing wealthy individuals and capital income. However, it lies beyond the power of conventional legal analysis to predict either what form such a war would take, or on what terms it might end up being resolved.</jats:p>",39,3,630,642,Constitutionality; Supreme court; Economics; Law; Income tax; Constitutional law; Doctrine; Law and economics; Political science,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oxrep/grad021,,10.1093/oxrep/grad021,,,0,017-848-426-488-011; 020-828-587-199-413; 025-364-754-788-493; 138-836-614-902-055,1,false,,

In this paper, I will, first of all, show that the time-lag argument has in fact involves a misunderstanding concept of simultaneity: according to Special Relativity, simultaneity is a matter of convention rather than a matter of fact, so, in principle, we can stipulate a perceptual conception of simultaneity, according to which what is seen is simultaneous with seeing. Secondly, the generalized time-lag argument has a mistaken view on the perceived events and perceiving; it has a doubtful assumption that these events are momentary in the mathematical sense. Such idealization is the main reason why we have the intuition that the time-lag effect of perceiving is in conflict with our ordinary perceptual experiences. Finally, I argue that the naïve realist account of the perceptual relation is a nontemporal constitutive relation; and hence naïve realism is compatible with the claim that we can perceive things as they were, and it should not be weakened by the time-lag argument.",199,3-4,11231,11248,,,,,Central European University,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03287-1,,10.1007/s11229-021-03287-1,,,0,003-444-849-796-738; 029-675-999-922-340; 035-028-762-687-895; 038-948-050-628-476; 087-139-738-755-892; 100-044-829-652-722; 106-712-657-155-867; 108-138-577-664-978; 135-773-705-059-142; 140-872-325-034-669; 158-511-313-905-674; 170-286-200-974-055,2,true,,green

Craig; Kim Rand; John D. Hartman,"BACKGROUND Stated preference research currently lacks a form of evidence that is well suited for small samples. A preference path is a sequence of two or more choices showing the evolution of an object following an adaptive process. OBJECTIVES The aims were to introduce preference paths and their kaizen tasks and to demonstrate how to analyze their evidence using a small sample. METHODS Twenty respondents were assigned the same 16 profiles generated from an orthogonal array based on the five attributes of the EQ-5D-5L descriptive system. Each kaizen task began with an opt-out paired comparison (i.e., choosing between the initial 10-year profile and the opt-out ""dying immediately""), followed by choosing three changes, and ended with a second paired comparison (final profile versus opt-out) if the respondent chose opt-out initially. By maximum likelihood with respondent clusters, we estimated the 20 main effects using conditional logit and Zermelo-Bradley-Terry (ZBT) specifications. RESULTS Apart from demonstrating heterogeneity and profile effects, all main effect estimates were non-negative, and most were significant (15 for logit and all 20 for ZBT; p value < 0.05). Under the logit and ZBT specifications, the value of the worst EQ-5D-5L profile (55555) is - 0.920 quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) or - 1.478 QALYs, respectively. Furthermore, the findings illustrate a log-linear relationship between the logit and ZBT main effects. CONCLUSION This paper demonstrates the feasibility of a stated-preference study that estimates 20 main effects using path evidence from 20 respondents (16 kaizen tasks, 15-min interviews). This approach shows promise for future application in stated-preference research, particularly in small samples.",15,2,1,10,Statistics; Logit; Kaizen; Respondent; Task (project management); Preference; Main effect; Mathematics; Process (engineering); p-value,,Humans; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Surveys and Questionnaires,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8321769 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40271-021-00541-z.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40271-021-00541-z https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/34327605,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40271-021-00541-z,34327605,10.1007/s40271-021-00541-z,3183935913,PMC8321769,0,005-917-531-187-609; 007-482-054-178-576; 008-747-265-876-531; 012-281-543-802-915; 014-702-855-888-936; 031-830-169-787-740; 036-519-810-320-522; 046-962-872-664-338; 050-799-687-507-143; 055-807-088-113-125; 061-220-911-839-067; 070-717-891-083-214; 074-123-195-625-304; 076-348-483-032-714; 080-953-961-928-399; 086-993-701-614-697; 088-912-834-943-633; 090-031-408-689-419; 092-668-593-967-935; 112-126-820-060-557; 113-587-582-462-734; 123-035-598-207-890; 130-099-953-831-484; 143-003-346-526-405; 143-778-771-063-978; 152-109-628-761-085,3,true,,green

Several methods have been proposed to prevent counting strategies, but the factors promoting those strategies in specific tasks are largely uninvestigated. Here, we modified a classical two-interval duration discrimination task in two aspects that could affect the tendency to apply counting strategies. We removed the pause between the two intervals and changed the task instructions: Participants decided whether a short event occurred in the first or in the second half of a reference duration. In Experiment 1, both classical and modified task versions were performed under timing conditions, in which participants were asked not to count, and counting conditions, in which counting was explicitly instructed. The task modifications led to (i) a general decrease in judgment precision, (ii) a shift of the point of subjective equality, and (iii) a counting-related increase in reaction times, suggesting enhanced cognitive effort of counting during the modified task version. Precision in the two task versions was not differently affected by instructed counting. Experiment 2 demonstrates that-in the absence of any counting-related instructions-participants are less likely to engage in spontaneous counting in the modified task version. These results enhance our understanding of the two-interval duration discrimination task and demonstrate that the modifications tested here-although they do not significantly reduce the effectiveness of instructed counting-can diminish the spontaneous tendency to adopt counting strategies.",84,8,2641,2654,Duration (music); Psychology; Statistics; Cognitive psychology; Computer science; Artificial intelligence; Mathematics; Art; Literature,Chronometric counting; Duration discrimination; Time discrimination; Time perception,Humans; Time Perception; Reaction Time; Judgment; Time Factors,,European Social Fund (AGETIME); Netherlands Organisation for Scientific Research (NWO) (453-16-005); Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft (411006663),https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13414-022-02523-1.pdf https://doi.org/10.3758/s13414-022-02523-1 https://pure.rug.nl/ws/files/325214776/s13414_022_02523_1.pdf https://research.rug.nl/files/325214776/s13414_022_02523_1.pdf https://research.rug.nl/en/publications/9f61de99-fe09-4918-9081-a96fb120ee89,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-022-02523-1,35701662,10.3758/s13414-022-02523-1,,PMC9630250,0,001-692-641-553-323; 002-883-202-256-827; 003-198-583-089-698; 004-774-037-953-919; 005-759-420-394-604; 005-810-554-734-986; 005-881-575-136-027; 006-290-347-298-886; 007-831-422-429-707; 008-331-913-073-376; 013-079-629-199-085; 014-495-551-672-571; 017-084-100-236-968; 017-771-278-703-53X; 019-619-125-082-02X; 022-750-773-879-514; 023-524-604-965-72X; 023-623-104-771-957; 025-276-123-341-011; 026-803-444-839-337; 028-793-089-543-473; 028-874-245-851-270; 031-548-750-166-877; 037-638-915-187-244; 038-346-004-185-32X; 038-961-268-211-004; 040-531-167-705-63X; 042-045-404-306-368; 042-313-418-976-328; 048-465-576-777-042; 055-261-544-027-772; 055-731-644-301-429; 060-645-774-719-735; 061-906-250-506-527; 062-075-339-997-336; 062-853-001-938-409; 063-868-826-939-180; 066-165-061-642-059; 070-983-211-803-268; 072-812-856-108-402; 073-272-656-380-139; 079-033-022-826-020; 088-303-854-941-930; 089-757-173-485-40X; 104-593-747-186-104; 105-215-390-324-399; 107-022-923-209-783; 111-807-149-235-791; 114-137-376-003-615; 121-216-946-275-129; 126-718-500-814-927; 128-769-892-108-839; 130-560-376-868-06X; 131-934-271-817-696; 132-147-384-499-050; 134-702-076-457-337; 148-444-009-844-504; 163-338-603-486-759; 167-275-555-617-549,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

The disaster resulted in considerable material and non-material losses. As a result of these impacts, a flood disaster mitigation strategy is needed in Banjar City. Flood disaster mitigation strategies are needed as a form of effort to reduce and manage the risks posed by floods to human health, economic activities, the environment, and cultural heritage. Therefore, this study aims to create a flood disaster mitigation strategy that can be done in Banjar City. This study uses  the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method which aims to obtain weights and determine the priority scale of flood disaster mitigation strategies used. In using this method there are several principles that must be understood in solving problems with AHP, namely decomposition, comparative judgment, synthsesis of priority and logical consistency.The results of the AHP analysis show that regional regulation policy strategies and their implementation (weight 0.195), policy strategies related to coordination between stakeholders (weight 0.185), policy strategies related to disaster risk assessment (weight 0.129), policy strategies related to disaster  management funding (weight 0.170), policy strategies related to increasing stakeholder capacity (weight 0.089), strategies for disaster-resilient communities and facilities and infrastructure (weight 0.089),  strategies for improving the quality and quantity of human resources (weight 0.085), and strategies for post-disaster recovery (weight 0.059). Based on  the results of the AHP analysis, an inconsistensy ratio of 0.014  &lt; 0.1 was obtained, which means that the results of the analysis can be accepted. </jats:p>",10,2,,,Analytic hierarchy process; Flood myth; Stakeholder; Environmental planning; Environmental resource management; Business; Emergency management; Risk analysis (engineering); Environmental science; Geography; Operations research; Engineering; Political science; Economics; Economic growth; Public relations; Archaeology,,,,,https://ppjp.ulm.ac.id/journal/index.php/jpg/article/download/16735/9448 https://doi.org/10.20527/jpg.v10i2.16735,http://dx.doi.org/10.20527/jpg.v10i2.16735,,10.20527/jpg.v10i2.16735,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

It is a perhaps little noticed feature of Foot’s project, in particular, that it aims to provide more than just a kind-relative account, but seeks an exhaustive account of goodness. She concludes, in effect, that goodness admits of only the kind-based sort. Accordingly, an individual’s goodness obtains solely in virtue of its satisfying kind-based standards. However, Mark Murphy has argued that a hypothetical “ignorant being” could satisfy its kind-relative standards by being ignorant, but we plausibly judge it to be bad when it does. Thus, an individual’s goodness does not obtain solely in virtue of meeting kind-based standards. In this sense, the ignorant being is a counterexample to any Aristotelian account similar to Foot’s. Unfortunately, Murphy’s counterexample fails because (for an Aristotelian) kind-based standards cannot require the lack of something. Nonetheless, I develop Murphy’s insight that something can satisfy kind-relative standards but nonetheless be bad—I propose a hypothetical Ebola-like microbe that meets its kind-standards of being destructive for its own sake, but it would plausibly be bad for doing so. In defending my counterexample, I challenge the Aristotelian contention that evaluations should only be made from “within” the standpoint of a particular lifeform conception, rather than an “external” one from which that kind itself can be judged to be bad.",50,2,451,471,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11406-021-00392-w,,10.1007/s11406-021-00392-w,,,0,002-262-446-902-950; 003-219-848-793-294; 017-681-009-319-119; 019-464-962-269-98X; 035-836-016-030-23X; 043-110-161-107-974; 046-313-347-561-031; 047-636-814-555-435; 056-966-097-010-026; 076-402-461-686-05X; 090-730-619-707-042; 094-607-450-284-292; 146-257-615-923-812; 177-413-636-094-247; 183-647-628-646-530,1,true,,green

The increasing scale of modern problems underscores the need to understand statistical inference in these models when the number of subjects diverges, which is currently lacking in the literature except in a few special instances. This paper addresses this gap by establishing an asymptotic normality result for the maximum likelihood estimator in a broad class of pairwise comparison models. The key idea lies in identifying the Fisher information matrix as a weighted graph Laplacian matrix which can be studied via a meticulous spectral analysis. Our findings provide the first unified theory for performing statistical inference in a wide range of pairwise comparison models beyond the Bradley--Terry model, benefiting practitioners with a solid theoretical guarantee for their use.

Though mostly associated with Goethe, its clearest outlines were available through a combination of Kant’s Critique of the Power of Judgment (1790) and Anthropology from a Pragmatic Point of View (1798). Weltliteratur, I argue, is the culmination of a set of ideas Kant introduced to account for the peculiar nature of the power of judgment or taste – that such judgments cannot have any a priori or universal principles and yet claim universality. Whether framed as the beautiful or the sublime, he suggested, such claims remained contingent, relying on a communal consensus that could have been established only according to anthropological principles. Kantian aesthetics is “impure” as it always and already relies on something external to it, that cannot be made sense of within the borders set by aesthetic judgment itself. Similarly, Weltliteratur was a combination of aesthetic and anthropological principles, advocating a form of comparative judgment replicating the Kantian model.",,,149,173,Sublime; Universality (dynamical systems); Aesthetics; Culmination; Sovereignty; Power (physics); Epistemology; Taste; Philosophy; Psychology; Law; Politics; Political science; Physics; Quantum mechanics; Astronomy; Neuroscience,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/9781009422635.008,,10.1017/9781009422635.008,,,0,,0,false,,

To ensure accurate ranking, it is essential to obtain precise estimates of the model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss. The difficulty of this task depends crucially on the topology of the pairwise comparison graph over the given items. However, beyond very few well-studied cases, such as the complete and Erd\""os-R\'enyi comparison graphs, little is known about the performance of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of the BTL model parameters in the $\ell_{\infty}$-loss under more general graph topologies. In this paper, we derive novel, general upper bounds on the $\ell_{\infty}$ estimation error of the BTL MLE that depend explicitly on the algebraic connectivity of the comparison graph, the maximal performance gap across items and the sample complexity. We demonstrate that the derived bounds perform well and in some cases are sharper compared to known results obtained using different loss functions and more restricted assumptions and graph topologies. We further provide minimax lower bounds under $\ell_{\infty}$-error that nearly match the upper bounds over a class of sufficiently regular graph topologies. Finally, we study the implications of our bounds for efficient tournament design.

Béguin; Klaas Sijtsma,"<p>Comparative judgment is a method that allows measurement of a competence by comparison of items with other items. In educational measurement, where comparative judgment is becoming an increasingly popular assessment method, items are mostly students’ responses to an assignment or an examination. For assessments using comparative judgment, the Scale Separation Reliability (SSR) is used to estimate the reliability of the measurement. Previous research has shown that the SSR may overestimate reliability when the pairs to be compared are selected with certain adaptive algorithms, when raters use different underlying models/truths, or when the true variance of the item parameters is below one. This research investigated bias and stability of the components of the SSR in relation to the number of comparisons per item to increase understanding of the SSR. We showed that many comparisons are required to obtain an accurate estimate of the item variance, but that the SSR can be useful even when the variance of the items is overestimated. Lastly, we recommend adjusting the general guideline for the required number of comparisons per item to 41 comparisons per item. This recommendation partly depends on the number of items and the true variance in our simulation study and needs further investigation.</p>",,,,,Variance (accounting); Reliability (semiconductor); Statistics; Competence (human resources); Stability (learning theory); Psychology; Computer science; Scale (ratio); Econometrics; Mathematics; Social psychology; Machine learning; Power (physics); Physics; Accounting; Quantum mechanics; Business,,,,,https://psyarxiv.com/kq4jh/download https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kq4jh https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/files/60484741/Crompvoets_et_al_2022_.pdf https://research.tilburguniversity.edu/en/publications/c19dacbf-bae9-4761-92ad-3c3fc463c35f https://pure.uvt.nl/ws/files/60484741/Crompvoets_et_al_2022_.pdf https://osf.io/kq4jh/download https://osf.io/kq4jh/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/kq4jh,,10.31234/osf.io/kq4jh,,,0,,0,true,,green

Up to now, only two studies examined the effect of both peer assessment methods on the quality of feedback and students’ performance. The study of Bouwer and colleagues (2018) provides evidence in favor of comparative judgement in the context of writing in English in higher education. Results of Stuulen and colleagues (2022) point to the opposite. However, their study focused on writing in Dutch in secondary education. Hence, it is questionable to what extent the results of Bouwer and colleagues regarding the learning effect of both peer assessment methods can be generalized to other contexts and subjects. Therefore, this study conceptually replicated the Bouwer et al.-study in the context of secondary education (problem-solving in physics, writing in French) and university education (scientific reporting of statistical information). Students’ feedback and performance after the peer assessment intervention were measured. Results showed that peer assessment method did not impact students’ performance in any of the samples.

And why do gender differences exist in self-assessments among women and men who earn the same grades? We use a mixed-method research design to answer these questions, utilizing both quantitative survey data (n = 764) and qualitative interview data (n = 59) from students in introductory computing courses at a large U.S. state university. Quantitatively, we find that women self-assess their computing ability significantly lower than men who earn the same grades, and that these lower self-assessments reduce the likelihood that women enroll in future CS courses (relative to men who earn equivalent grades). Qualitatively, we explore how women and men perceive their own computing ability to understand why women self-assess their ability lower than men. Our interviews revealed that women were much less likely than men to make favorable comparative judgements about their ability relative to their classmates. Women also had higher personal performance standards than men. Lastly, women were more likely than men to experience disrespectful treatment, with an undertone of presumed incompetence, from their TAs and classmates. In sum, this research furthers our understanding of why gender differences exist in self-assessments of computing ability and how these differences can contribute to gender disparities in computing persistence. It also draws attention to the importance of feedback in computing courses and suggests that improving course feedback may reduce gender disparities in computing.",,,,,Persistence (discontinuity); Psychology; Social psychology; Engineering; Geotechnical engineering,,,,NSF (National Science Foundation),,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3501385.3543963,,10.1145/3501385.3543963,,,0,000-142-171-235-917; 002-800-534-380-65X; 003-496-075-546-595; 009-332-695-443-64X; 013-065-221-809-209; 014-928-408-825-53X; 019-232-533-854-387; 026-627-146-282-593; 031-244-011-262-416; 033-529-098-360-562; 040-404-928-029-057; 042-913-151-696-923; 042-985-302-868-490; 045-902-884-791-739; 047-408-870-279-653; 047-603-197-160-567; 049-585-064-026-811; 050-709-564-220-036; 055-375-237-716-821; 056-581-200-115-487; 058-393-093-416-923; 070-529-122-960-376; 073-704-667-050-748; 075-399-216-414-025; 091-145-427-000-56X; 107-262-408-705-590; 110-378-639-400-578; 130-228-809-975-633; 142-636-465-585-751; 144-704-796-671-19X; 152-452-491-978-918; 160-944-608-169-964; 168-545-213-043-702,6,false,,

In assessing these projects, educators most often use rubrics where points are given for meeting specific criteria and grades determined through adding up these points which can be time consuming and restrictive. Seldom is a holistic approach taken to assessing student design projects. The desire to employ holistic assessment strategies to student work with open-ended and divergent responses has been widely noted in the literature. Holistic strategies can provide insight into the role of qualities, such as creativity, which are not typically incorporated into standard assessment rubrics. Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) is an assessment approach developed to assess student performance in a holistic manner. The ACJ system is composed of three elements; a set of portfolios produced by students in response to an open-ended assignment, a set of judges which may be made up of students or experts in the area, and a pairs system. ACJ is supported by a software solution that adaptively selects pairs of portfolios and presents them to the judges, who judge the work based on professional constructs of performance and capability e.g., creativity. At any one time the judges are making comparisons between only two portfolios, and they select the one of the two that they believe is more creative (in this example). Each portfolio is judged on multiple occasions by various judges, in various pair combinations, providing a broader consensus of the creativity of the work based on multiple perspectives. The output of the judges is a rank-ordered list of the least to most creative portfolios. In studies using the ACJ system to measure various design qualities, high reliability levels have been achieved among judges (~0.9). Given the dynamic nature of the ACJ assessment tool, there are various benefits this approach can offer engineering educators. The demands placed on an educator to assess many portfolios may be reduced as students can act as the judges and reliably assess their peer’s work. In addition, the ACJ approach can support students in gaining feedback on the standard of their own work relative to that of their peers which is a valuable experience for first-year engineering students. This paper will explore the use and benefits of ACJ for assessing first-year engineering design projects. Further, conference attendees will be provided the opportunity throughout the conference to engage with the ACJ software as judges to experience how this system can work in practice for assessing student design projects.",,,,,Judgement; Computer science; Systems engineering; Engineering; Software engineering; Engineering management; Political science; Law,,,,,https://peer.asee.org/42252.pdf https://doi.org/10.18260/1-2--42252,http://dx.doi.org/10.18260/1-2--42252,,10.18260/1-2--42252,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

This research puts forward a website-based Decision Support System (DSS) leveraging Analytic Hierarchy Process to recommend appropriate shows per personalized criteria. The DSS allows parents to set priorities across factors like educational value, empathy, and social norms reflected in shows. Quantitative AHP methodology ranks options by synthesizing comparative judgments. A prototype is implemented on PHP/MySQL with an intuitive interface explaining decision logic. Testing with parent focus groups indicates significantly increased perceived utility over traditional controls. Recommendation accuracy metrics averaged 0.81 against test cases. Outcomes demonstrate feasibility and benefits of applying multi-criteria DSS techniques to aid value-based media selection for impressionable minds. The system aims to aid busy caregivers overwhelmed by the exponential growth in media choices, promoting discerning consumption. Further enhancements incorporating explanatory facilities and predictive analytics promises wider applicability inside content distribution ecosystems.

A comparative judgement study of mathematics teachers' and mathematics education researchers' views,2022-02-21,2022,journal article,Review of Education,20496613,Wiley,,Lucy Rycroft‐Smith; Andreas J. Stylianides,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:sec><jats:label /><jats:p>The field of knowledge brokering in education—aiming to better connect research to practice—is currently emerging. Evidence of a community dissonance between researchers and practitioners in education suggests that models of knowledge brokering that consider the perspectives and priorities of both groups are required. It is also a priority to identify what kinds of knowledge brokering products such as research summaries are successful at communicating research to teachers, potentially functioning as boundary objects. We report findings from a comparative judgement study where a group of 28 mathematics teachers and a group of 19 mathematics education researchers ranked twenty research summaries, from different sources, in terms of their success at communicating the research to teachers, and explained which features contributed to this ranking. Overall the findings suggest moderate consensus both within and between the two groups, and some important areas of difference. Both groups agreed that graphic design was the most important element of a research summary; that being summarised, having implications for practice and being easy to read or accessible and well‐structured were key features of a research summary; and that the length of the research summary or the time it might take to read were also important. Whereas teachers mentioned the choice of topic of the research summary and to some extent language more than researchers, researchers highlighted some other features of successful research summaries for them that teachers did not: ideas around methodology and use of evidence, opportunities for critical reflection, and issues of trust and credibility.</jats:p></jats:sec>",10,1,,,Judgement; Credibility; Cognitive dissonance; Ranking (information retrieval); Mathematics education; Field (mathematics); Educational research; Psychology; Pedagogy; Computer science; Political science; Mathematics; Social psychology; Machine learning; Pure mathematics; Law,,,,,https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/bitstreams/518c63e7-ed05-42e3-b25c-3353943a456b/download https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/334273,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/rev3.3338,,10.1002/rev3.3338,,,0,000-029-393-456-745; 001-745-162-045-424; 003-714-298-303-550; 004-892-255-554-753; 005-376-715-356-80X; 006-719-004-793-059; 008-348-452-564-156; 008-760-875-621-743; 013-083-292-850-208; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-147-931-717-473; 019-008-132-364-604; 019-573-587-504-919; 027-060-959-776-453; 027-901-023-757-187; 029-920-508-994-320; 030-911-823-907-814; 031-526-833-359-589; 032-397-169-378-770; 035-966-099-589-64X; 036-879-287-272-325; 039-128-833-804-133; 040-076-670-791-772; 040-241-846-826-833; 041-773-785-359-605; 045-923-033-601-768; 046-145-529-810-908; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-015-920-772-700; 051-987-242-900-131; 057-445-715-156-982; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-018-633-775-336; 068-124-584-046-362; 078-789-513-741-594; 082-525-671-850-628; 090-746-494-914-270; 097-857-366-346-850; 103-560-676-257-456; 109-837-022-787-113; 127-386-558-633-748; 127-952-047-131-74X; 133-376-382-509-687; 133-972-645-991-470; 134-050-025-714-224; 135-916-001-658-257; 138-533-770-925-787; 143-720-074-909-032; 147-960-504-916-397; 148-673-033-661-432; 155-667-639-648-147; 158-299-133-953-294; 160-805-237-718-329; 163-254-575-996-453; 163-555-833-697-835; 164-271-157-163-230; 168-704-895-296-891; 179-099-769-036-331; 185-706-258-601-035,2,true,cc-by-nc-nd,green

These models incorporate health-related quality of life (HRQoL) values that can be determined using physician panels. The predominant opinion is that one should use values obtained from citizens. We investigated whether physicians give different HRQoL values to citizens and evaluate whether such differences impact decision model outcomes.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""METHODS"" NlmCategory=""METHODS"">A two-round Delphi study was conducted. Citizens estimated HRQoL of pre- and post-operative health states for ten surgeries using a visual analogue scale. These values were compared using Bland-Altman analysis with HRQoL values previously obtained from physicians. Impact on decision model outcomes was evaluated by calculating the correlation between the rankings of surgeries established using the physicians' and the citizens' values.</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""RESULTS"" NlmCategory=""RESULTS"">A total of 71 citizens estimated HRQoL. Citizens' values on the VAS scale were - 0.07 points (95% CI - 0.12 to - 0.01) lower than the physicians' values. The correlation between the rankings of surgeries based on citizens' and physicians' values was 0.96 (p &lt; 0.001).</AbstractText>;           <AbstractText Label=""CONCLUSION"" NlmCategory=""CONCLUSIONS"">Physicians put higher values on health states than citizens. However, these differences only result in switches between adjacent entries in the ranking.

164-690-848-988-836,Transformative experience and the principle of informed consent in medicine,2023-08-18,2023,journal article,Synthese,15730964; 00397857,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Karl Egerton; Helen Capitelli-McMahon,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>This paper explores how transformative experience generates decision-making problems of particular seriousness in medical settings. Potentially transformative experiences are especially likely to be encountered in medicine, and the associated decisions are confronted jointly by patients and clinicians in the context of an imbalance of power and expertise. However in such scenarios the principle of informed consent, which plays a central role in guiding clinicians, is unequal to the task. We detail how the principle’s assumptions about autonomy, rationality and information handle transformative experiences poorly, appealing to several difficult cases for medical decision-making to illustrate the resulting problem, and we consider how the existing literature on complications with consent fails to offer a resolution. We argue that recognition of the problem has a role to play in achieving a more effective response to transformative decisions. In Sect. 1 we introduce several representative cases of challenging patient decision-making that clinicians might face. In Sect. 2 we detail how transformative experience has been analysed in the recent literature, before outlining in Sect. 3 the theoretical basis of the principle of informed consent, which plays a central role in how clinicians are expected to support decision-making. In Sect. 4, having laid the groundwork for a clear description, we return to the cases given in Sect. 1 to confirm how their transformative nature presents a problem: either clinicians treat the decisions faced by these patients as ‘normal’, encouraging them to focus on information provision that patients may be unable to act on, or they treat them as transformative, in which case they lack the resources to recognise whether they are helping patients make (subjectively) good decisions. In Sect. 5 we argue that the existing literature does not offer any escape from this problem. We close in Sect. 6 by noting the significant impact that appreciating the problem of transformative experience could have on supporting transformative decisions in medicine and briefly suggesting how we might aim to develop new approaches to dealing with these.</jats:p>",202,3,,,Transformative learning; Rationality; Context (archaeology); Autonomy; Informed consent; Psychology; Beneficence; Epistemology; Medicine; Engineering ethics; Alternative medicine; Law; Political science; Pedagogy; Paleontology; Philosophy; Pathology; Biology; Engineering,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-023-04258-4.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-023-04258-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-023-04258-4,,10.1007/s11229-023-04258-4,,,0,011-472-132-486-669; 024-418-419-051-149; 030-152-991-173-413; 038-416-305-449-035; 053-029-672-514-293; 053-918-926-878-928; 054-222-834-764-65X; 060-557-033-326-483; 063-714-706-485-83X; 069-902-439-542-479; 084-032-956-002-486; 085-796-608-843-082; 087-099-292-212-24X; 089-901-364-848-246; 097-491-485-178-550; 112-964-510-760-948; 114-800-196-905-900; 118-204-093-358-865,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

Despite being putatively grounded in the statistical regularities of the environment, scene priors are frequently violated due to the inherent variability of visual features from one scene to the next. However, these repeated violations do not appreciably challenge visuo-cognitive function, necessitating the broad use of priors in conjunction with context-specific information. We investigated the trade-off between participants’ internal expectations formed from both longer-term priors and those formed from immediate contextual information using a perceptual inference task and naturalistic stimuli. Notably, our task required participants to make perceptual inferences about naturalistic images using their own internal criteria, rather than making comparative judgements. Nonetheless, we show that observers’ performance is well approximated by a model that makes inferences using a prior for low-level image statistics, aggregated over many images. We further show that the dependence on this prior is rapidly re-weighted against contextual information, whether relevant or irrelevant. Our results therefore provide insight into how apparent high-level interpretations of scene appearances follow from the most basic of perceptual processes, which are grounded in the statistics of natural images.</jats:p>",,,,,Prior probability; Perception; Inference; Context (archaeology); Task (project management); Cognitive psychology; Scene statistics; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Visual perception; Computer science; Psychology; Bayesian probability; Geography; Management; Archaeology; Neuroscience; Economics,,,,,https://www.biorxiv.org/content/biorxiv/early/2022/09/17/2022.09.15.507892.full.pdf https://doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.15.507892,http://dx.doi.org/10.1101/2022.09.15.507892,,10.1101/2022.09.15.507892,,,0,001-529-878-461-937; 002-608-830-214-912; 004-412-257-999-97X; 004-495-694-854-142; 005-589-187-502-728; 005-683-281-007-732; 009-163-025-047-715; 010-629-061-233-301; 013-064-393-085-978; 015-565-968-648-347; 015-585-177-771-742; 015-730-462-360-529; 017-135-162-827-904; 023-847-808-127-02X; 024-306-285-412-917; 025-503-036-092-835; 026-837-694-510-345; 027-149-374-389-854; 027-469-339-304-213; 029-508-198-248-765; 029-716-303-639-642; 031-324-485-402-628; 035-682-216-930-014; 036-215-458-962-338; 037-283-744-087-993; 038-597-067-017-08X; 038-996-393-744-547; 043-313-402-247-864; 044-775-893-870-345; 045-582-156-978-714; 046-172-712-057-196; 048-498-071-032-230; 051-169-072-541-986; 059-098-493-584-496; 060-248-650-100-798; 061-971-783-481-511; 065-054-386-756-11X; 070-025-622-372-387; 070-727-233-075-350; 070-841-468-126-318; 071-162-359-326-400; 071-520-103-682-994; 073-336-297-732-525; 080-266-920-202-204; 082-317-326-613-457; 088-467-480-843-05X; 106-369-561-744-653; 138-788-628-079-932; 139-310-234-201-839; 152-442-693-993-359; 162-378-343-549-214,0,true,cc-by-nc,green

The existence and uniqueness of the estimator is a key issue of the evaluation. In the case of two options, a necessary and sufficient condition is given by Ford in the Bradley-Terry model. We generalize this statement for the set of strictly log-concave distribution. Although in the case of three options necessary and sufficient condition is not known, there are two different sufficient conditions which are formulated in the literature. In this paper we generalize them, moreover we compare these conditions. Their capacities to indicate the existence of the maximum are analyzed by a large number of computer simulations.

Chain-of-Thought (CoT) technique is widely regarded as one of the effective methods for enhancing the reasoning ability of foundation models and has garnered significant attention. However, the reasoning process of CoT is linear, step-by-step, similar to personal logical reasoning, suitable for solving general and slightly complicated problems. On the contrary, the thinking pattern of an expert owns two prominent characteristics that cannot be handled appropriately in CoT, i.e., high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodal comparative judgement. Therefore, the core motivation of this paper is transcending CoT to construct a reasoning paradigm that can think like an expert. The hyperedge of a hypergraph could connect various vertices, making it naturally suitable for modelling high-order relationships. Inspired by this, this paper innovatively proposes a multimodal Hypergraph-of-Thought (HoT) reasoning paradigm, which enables the foundation models to possess the expert-level ability of high-order multi-hop reasoning and multimodal comparative judgement. Specifically, a textual hypergraph-of-thought is constructed utilizing triple as the primary thought to model higher-order relationships, and a hyperedge-of-thought is generated through multi-hop walking paths to achieve multi-hop inference. Furthermore, we devise a visual hypergraph-of-thought to interact with the textual hypergraph-of-thought via Cross-modal Co-Attention Graph Learning for multimodal comparative verification. Experimentations on the ScienceQA benchmark demonstrate the proposed HoT-based T5 outperforms CoT-based GPT3.5 and chatGPT, which is on par with CoT-based GPT4 with a lower model size.",,,,,Hypergraph; Judgement; Computer science; Inference; Artificial intelligence; Deductive reasoning; Abductive reasoning; Mathematics; Epistemology; Philosophy; Discrete mathematics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.06207,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2308.06207,,10.48550/arxiv.2308.06207,,,0,,0,true,,green

To achieve this, the information energy for LOR is constructed firstly, and its features are analysed, which makes a basis for the conversion process. After that, the details about how to integrate the prospect theory with variable reference points into the conversion-based aggregation framework are presented.

The goal of this package is to facilitate the use of Bayesian models for paired comparison data in behavioral research. Historically, studies on preferences have relied on Likert scale assessments and the frequentist approach to analyze the data. As an alternative, this article proposes the use of Bayesian models for forced choices assessments. The advantages of forced-choice assessments are that they minimize common bias that Likert scales are susceptible to, they can increase criterion validity, control for faking responses, and are quite useful to assess preferences in studies with children and non-humans primates. Bayesian data analyses are less sensitive to optional stopping, have better control of type I error, have stronger evidence towards the null hypothesis, allows propagation of uncertainties, includes prior information, and perform well when handling models with many parameters and latent variables. The bpcs package provides a consistent interface for R users and several functions to evaluate the posterior distribution of all parameters, to estimate the posterior distribution of any contest between items, and to obtain the posterior distribution of the ranks. Three reanalyses of recent studies that used the frequentist Bradley-Terry model are presented. These reanalyses are conducted with the Bayesian models of the bpcs package and all the code used to fit the models, generate the figures and the tables are available in the online appendix.",,,,,Bayesian probability; Statistical model; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Frequentist inference; Criterion validity; Null hypothesis; Type I and type II errors; Computer science; Latent variable; Posterior probability,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210111227I/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.11227.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11227,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210111227I/abstract,,,3122527730,,0,000-499-525-775-294; 001-196-876-979-000; 001-298-764-371-292; 004-107-553-174-752; 004-414-436-917-174; 004-536-668-580-211; 005-221-425-379-679; 005-542-264-252-155; 008-385-491-458-383; 011-105-391-999-886; 019-700-320-513-727; 025-009-658-071-875; 025-133-922-650-453; 027-151-451-153-494; 033-139-527-666-540; 036-214-652-015-794; 037-094-759-392-621; 041-706-379-743-767; 045-187-870-348-998; 045-191-659-606-690; 047-005-506-445-938; 047-665-680-465-014; 050-033-593-645-124; 050-701-869-637-24X; 055-600-792-655-544; 057-392-284-297-081; 057-854-907-659-266; 059-790-090-462-903; 064-222-946-416-791; 064-327-070-430-812; 070-387-752-002-083; 071-128-125-229-764; 074-584-077-233-459; 075-371-735-842-22X; 096-558-601-945-495; 097-222-159-458-236; 098-277-516-859-498; 102-115-650-201-495; 102-668-674-697-675; 110-934-761-269-686; 120-424-874-837-080; 120-844-182-141-737; 123-248-307-932-339; 124-850-148-955-311; 127-473-686-648-632; 144-551-450-594-92X; 157-836-209-064-35X; 160-398-319-036-967; 173-845-612-535-179,1,true,,unknown

174-071-328-916-716,Examining the Validity of Adaptive Comparative Judgment for Peer Evaluation in a Design Thinking Course,2021-12-16,2021,journal article,Frontiers in Education,2504284x,Frontiers Media SA,,Nathan Mentzer; Wonki Lee; Scott Ronald Bartholomew,"<jats:p>Adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) is a holistic judgment approach used to evaluate the quality of something (e.g., student work) in which individuals are presented with pairs of work and select the better item from each pair. This approach has demonstrated high levels of reliability with less bias than other approaches, hence providing accurate values in summative and formative assessment in educational settings. Though ACJ itself has demonstrated significantly high reliability levels, relatively few studies have investigated the validity of peer-evaluated ACJ in the context of design thinking. This study explored peer-evaluation, facilitated through ACJ, in terms of construct validity and criterion validity (concurrent validity and predictive validity) in the context of a design thinking course. Using ACJ, undergraduate students (<jats:italic>n</jats:italic>= 597) who took a design thinking course during Spring 2019 were invited to evaluate design point-of-view (POV) statements written by their peers. As a result of this ACJ exercise, each POV statement attained a specific parameter value, which reflects the quality of POV statements. In order to examine the construct validity, researchers conducted a content analysis, comparing the contents of the 10 POV statements with highest scores (parameter values) and the 10 POV statements with the lowest scores (parameter values)—as derived from the ACJ session. For the criterion validity, we studied the relationship between peer-evaluated ACJ and grader’s rubric-based grading. To study the concurrent validity, we investigated the correlation between peer-evaluated ACJ parameter values and grades assigned by course instructors for the same POV writing task. Then, predictive validity was studied by exploring if peer-evaluated ACJ of POV statements were predictive of students’ grades on the final project. Results showed that the contents of the statements with the highest parameter values were of better quality compared to the statements with the lowest parameter values. Therefore, peer-evaluated ACJ showed construct validity. Also, though peer-evaluated ACJ did not show concurrent validity, it did show moderate predictive validity.</jats:p>",6,,,,Psychology; Construct validity; Rubric; Concurrent validity; Criterion validity; Context (archaeology); Formative assessment; Validity; Predictive validity; Peer review; Summative assessment; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Psychometrics; Developmental psychology; Mathematics education; Paleontology; Political science; Law; Internal consistency; Biology,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2021.772832/pdf https://doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.772832,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2021.772832,,10.3389/feduc.2021.772832,,,0,004-694-552-022-836; 007-457-067-177-80X; 009-637-256-851-606; 009-794-060-300-967; 011-965-796-500-684; 018-191-594-451-288; 018-392-325-202-807; 019-864-198-596-020; 021-738-595-719-412; 023-762-309-983-515; 024-043-673-348-847; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-241-846-826-833; 040-733-081-088-111; 042-970-223-978-163; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 055-683-393-109-729; 056-810-342-827-208; 058-676-708-197-06X; 060-266-666-850-63X; 062-948-305-185-049; 064-944-520-005-770; 066-705-540-153-986; 066-908-670-161-319; 070-645-783-329-088; 075-557-430-341-040; 080-676-060-189-901; 088-132-143-522-226; 093-458-026-164-491; 102-955-514-174-383; 109-184-949-641-376; 110-616-007-605-146; 126-454-221-798-016; 131-318-995-894-057; 133-169-465-779-218; 149-208-961-050-864; 153-941-031-287-829; 154-103-492-991-61X; 156-978-855-468-241; 158-281-733-617-774; 166-098-100-691-397; 168-166-496-535-984; 168-704-895-296-891; 172-094-798-292-353; 185-957-501-705-093,3,true,cc-by,gold

These traditions have remained largely separate despite partly overlapping concerns and similar underlying strategies of argumentation. They have also both been the subject of similar criticisms based on naturalistic approaches to the philosophy of science, which have addressed their apparent reliance on a transcendental mode of reasoning, their seeming distance from social scientific practice, and their (erroneous?) tendency to advocate global solutions to local and pragmatic problems. Two approaches aiming to naturalize these two traditions of social ontology have been proposed in recent years: one drawing on a Gierean, model-based approach to scientific practice, the other drawing on inference to the best explanation. In our paper, we compare and contrast these naturalistic approaches to social ontology in terms of their capacity to respond to the aforementioned challenges. We also defend a form of methodological pluralism, according to which there are multiple different naturalistically acceptable approaches to social ontology, which emphasize contrasting procedural continuities between social scientific research and philosophical practice.</jats:p>",201,3,,,Epistemology; Philosophy of science; Scientific realism; Ontology; Naturalism; Argumentation theory; Social ontology; Pluralism (philosophy); Inference; Philosophy of social science; Social epistemology; Monism; Transcendental number; Sociology; Social philosophy; Social science; Social relation; Philosophy,,,,Koneen Säätiö; University of Helsinki including Helsinki University Central Hospital,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6,,10.1007/s11229-023-04105-6,,,0,000-036-548-641-001; 002-478-716-377-635; 002-998-636-516-534; 003-587-081-547-635; 003-997-734-629-227; 004-895-024-459-381; 007-131-371-256-975; 007-570-960-128-087; 007-586-012-108-728; 007-859-219-787-984; 008-003-964-158-107; 009-305-508-060-544; 013-749-559-494-133; 014-351-028-121-414; 015-517-492-743-181; 016-634-405-113-982; 019-959-408-672-485; 023-046-986-502-240; 023-309-507-256-671; 023-794-235-597-983; 024-224-514-358-856; 025-635-329-358-275; 025-653-225-444-426; 026-273-215-832-697; 026-330-832-505-753; 028-080-183-905-557; 030-385-624-387-919; 036-027-393-683-750; 039-152-714-683-906; 039-290-997-043-073; 040-199-341-557-168; 041-019-223-490-64X; 043-244-874-867-926; 043-453-115-743-093; 043-463-995-826-530; 043-673-140-134-083; 044-010-463-313-018; 044-461-152-066-753; 045-537-144-300-663; 046-254-013-166-085; 046-685-785-878-167; 048-846-349-450-989; 049-149-223-239-590; 049-833-550-513-973; 050-947-228-575-421; 052-009-115-928-982; 052-669-663-582-082; 054-203-508-717-571; 054-290-715-145-332; 056-906-307-884-414; 057-372-475-514-423; 057-477-554-117-996; 058-184-329-455-400; 058-899-513-209-639; 059-733-178-842-221; 060-818-455-845-614; 062-278-768-278-751; 063-112-291-064-006; 064-959-690-701-439; 066-081-298-269-645; 066-367-441-814-217; 067-789-872-350-668; 068-022-862-879-923; 068-512-608-550-243; 071-777-771-095-406; 072-672-190-147-429; 074-400-115-205-143; 075-077-357-213-399; 076-342-050-971-567; 079-509-816-111-626; 080-030-365-968-831; 081-874-345-618-064; 082-985-832-756-243; 084-424-103-378-193; 084-768-047-278-874; 085-856-771-600-680; 090-738-237-848-225; 093-282-251-149-451; 094-992-359-275-583; 095-070-006-795-757; 095-398-589-228-592; 096-263-036-559-63X; 096-736-215-875-563; 099-125-336-931-409; 100-214-688-904-007; 102-592-979-083-473; 103-639-900-711-898; 109-038-074-218-288; 110-701-325-228-530; 111-856-164-989-226; 112-705-635-036-471; 115-719-341-197-612; 120-430-854-361-661; 121-016-793-882-123; 123-947-895-393-441; 125-234-426-938-552; 126-760-394-033-551; 128-321-653-184-505; 132-677-367-799-498; 137-649-043-667-142; 138-407-676-727-357; 138-928-934-418-869; 140-567-742-906-463; 144-894-188-424-187; 145-149-658-697-232; 146-233-042-674-209; 147-562-981-442-127; 150-827-462-615-005; 151-630-566-817-274; 153-857-921-718-035; 159-698-299-074-091; 164-941-107-511-727; 169-668-693-369-993; 172-373-053-016-786; 172-908-532-586-696; 174-464-834-938-341; 174-685-456-118-133; 175-618-941-846-712; 177-856-725-145-766; 179-073-746-330-751; 193-639-431-200-298; 194-936-074-717-05X; 195-079-211-044-238; 198-261-204-246-480; 199-743-094-663-969,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

To address this issue, manufacturing processes should become more flexible. One of the most promising technologies to achieve this goal is collaborative robotics (or ‘cobots’). In collaborative assembly processes, human and robot combine their skills. However, the co-existence of humans and cobots in the same workspace may influence the operators’ perception of assembly complexity. The analysis and control of assembly complexity are crucial to achieving better performances in terms of process quality and operators’ well-being. Many qualitative methods have been proposed in the literature to provide a holistic assessment of assembly complexity. This paper proposes a novel method to define a quantitative scale of perceived assembly complexity, based on Thurstone Law of Comparative Judgements. This method was applied to an experimental case-study concerning the assembly of three different products in two modalities (i.e. manual and collaborative). Regression analysis showed that the perceived complexity may be related to the occurrence of process failures and to the perceived workload. The method also proved capable of identifying assembly processes where cobot assistance was helpful, providing process designers with a supporting tool to minimise perceived complexity.",,,1,21,Judgement; Thurstone scale; Process (computing); Artificial intelligence; Modalities; Perception; Computer science; Management science; Process management; Engineering; Psychology; Developmental psychology; Social science; Neuroscience; Sociology; Political science; Law; Operating system,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00207543.2023.2291519,,10.1080/00207543.2023.2291519,,,0,000-975-380-153-519; 001-083-853-307-032; 004-877-171-081-463; 007-277-985-466-338; 009-681-876-580-665; 013-215-015-717-750; 016-693-057-650-297; 019-373-212-232-893; 023-956-882-134-132; 024-848-286-367-819; 027-461-362-966-622; 028-488-521-456-90X; 028-641-405-918-925; 028-983-733-725-313; 029-275-637-527-033; 030-157-103-199-010; 030-247-466-306-339; 031-584-802-088-996; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-524-713-865-69X; 043-010-387-123-047; 046-728-743-753-443; 048-092-008-205-493; 051-187-441-374-212; 051-343-253-960-259; 053-391-378-103-823; 059-375-090-642-324; 060-282-059-556-789; 060-510-899-564-089; 064-438-003-431-85X; 064-885-220-878-505; 067-748-140-319-824; 069-691-609-308-275; 072-667-982-190-189; 074-231-677-745-665; 076-475-683-598-626; 077-373-459-472-112; 081-429-734-358-205; 082-182-298-937-167; 083-894-765-527-100; 084-575-694-808-797; 084-969-269-200-774; 088-383-159-244-474; 092-044-315-159-799; 093-979-684-442-338; 096-239-462-922-956; 098-781-373-003-344; 099-746-061-648-357; 100-891-688-805-138; 121-610-970-177-137; 128-025-370-294-986; 132-402-908-923-998; 133-865-805-701-96X; 143-657-228-106-533; 166-800-311-737-17X; 168-674-475-322-18X; 170-331-667-492-498; 179-546-740-291-787,1,false,,

For general graphs, we show that, with sufficiently many samples, maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) achieves an entrywise estimation error matching the Cram\'er-Rao lower bound, which can be stated in terms of effective resistances; the key to our analysis is a connection between statistical estimation and iterative optimization by preconditioned gradient descent. We are also particularly interested in graphs with locality, where only nearby items can be connected by edges; our analysis identifies conditions under which locality does not hurt, i.e. comparing the scores between a pair of items that are far apart in the graph is nearly as easy as comparing a pair of nearby items. We further explore divide-and-conquer algorithms that can provably achieve similar guarantees even in the regime with the sparsest samples, while enjoying certain computational advantages.

Our main aim here is to assess whether the content of such anti-women local proverbs in Esan are valid or anachronistic. This is in the light of the message that indigenous knowledge is ideally meant to convey; and will be done by a comparative judgmental approach to the cultural and modern realities. Esan people are an ethnic group in Edo State of Nigeria whose research on women in Esan proverbs or proverbs about Esan is investigated in this treatise by researchers who speak the language under consideration. Can this insider-researcher perspective help us to deconstruct the negative portrayal and eventually reconstruct Esan proverbs as we strive to build an all-inclusive society for all? Methodologically, we harvested Esan proverbs through our public interactions with elders, and young and old adults in both rural and urban Esan communities. Our overall study reveals, amongst others, that the content of derogatory Esan proverbs with women as subjects are not valid statements, but are by-products of centuries of negative interiorization across the decades; and indeed by consuming the patriarchal systems that are insensitive to the inconsistencies of such proverbs as opposed to the cultural and modern realities of the numerous virtues and accomplishments of Esan women. The research article finally affirms that the anti-women local proverbs are part of the traditional structure that has fought the success of the thoroughbred modern agitations for female empowerment and the quest for gender equality.</jats:p>",6,1,1,9,Indigenous; Anachronism; Insider; Sociology; Ethnic group; State (computer science); Psychology; Social science; Gender studies; Anthropology; Politics; Law; Political science; Ecology; Algorithm; Computer science; Biology,,,,,https://jumugajournal.org/index.php/jjeoshs/article/download/56/56 https://doi.org/10.35544/jjeoshs.v6i1.53,http://dx.doi.org/10.35544/jjeoshs.v6i1.53,,10.35544/jjeoshs.v6i1.53,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

Wu; D. Qu; J. Leverett; S. Whitehead,"Sun-exposed and sun-protected skin age differently by deviating from ideal state over time, which manifest through changes on skin complexion. Understanding the perception of such variations is important for cosmetic and sociobehavioral research. We developed an objective grading scale using an artificial neural network (ANN) to quantify human perception towards skin complexion and applied the scale in comparing sun-exposed and sun-protected skin in an Indian cohort. Total 72 female facial clinical images (age 20-60) acquired via VISIA®-CR were shown in pairs (n = 108) to 104 naïve panelists, who were forced to make a choice (left or right) at a central location. A zero-sum Bradley Terry (BT) model was applied to the pairwise comparison matrix for individual image ranking. A Siamese neural network was trained to mimic panel behaviors to rate additional pairs that were not previously rated. Final ranking of 424 individual images was obtained via a minorize-maximization algorithm and a latent feature namely skin ideal complexion score (ICS) was derived to a scale (0-9) for characterizing skin complexion (9 is the most ideal). Images of sun-exposed skin (cheek, forearm, upper arm dorsal, outer thigh) and sun-protected skin (upper arm volar, buttock, inner thigh, lower back) were taken using a twin-flash DSLR camera (n=30) and their ICS were computed via an ANN and compared among each other and against self-surveys. Skin ICS is higher for images of younger skin and lower for aged skin, and the correlation coefficient is -0.12 per year age increase with R2=0.60 (p < 0.05). For sun-exposed skin, ICS of forearm, upper arm (dorsal) and outer thigh are 2.5%, 2.4% and 2.0% higher (p < 0.05) than ICS of cheek respectively, while for sun-protected skin, ICS of upper arm (volar) is the highest and is 4.0% higher (p < 0.05) than ICS of cheek, corroborating with self-survey results. However, ICS of lower back, buttock and inner thigh show no statistical difference than ICS of cheek. The ANN using direct clinical photo as input is an attractive framework for quantifying perceptual skin features.",143,5,S118,S118,Artificial intelligence; Medicine; Grading scale; Perception; Artificial neural network; Psychology; Computer science; Surgery; Neuroscience,,,,,http://www.jidonline.org/article/S0022202X23008692/pdf https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2023.03.694,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jid.2023.03.694,,10.1016/j.jid.2023.03.694,,,0,,0,true,,bronze

This ability is referred to in the literature as professional vision. The present study assesses mentor teachers’ (n = 137) professional vision regarding teacher-student interactions and differentiated instruction, using a validated video-based comparative judgement measurement instrument. The results indicate that mentor teachers have a high professional vision. It can thus be assumed that mentor teachers can support student teachers. Additionally, their professional vision is compared with that of classroom teachers (n = 996) and student teachers (n = 2168), expecting it to be significantly higher than that of classroom teachers and student teachers. The results show no significant difference between mentor teachers and classroom teachers but a significant difference between mentor teachers and student teachers. Hence, mentor teachers and classroom teachers are equally able to identify and interpret crucial aspects of effective teaching behaviour and both groups are better able than student teachers in this regard. This study contributes to the current state of the art on mentor teachers from a theoretical, empirical and methodological point of view.KEYWORDS: Mentor teachersprofessional visioncomparative judgementteacher-student interactionsdifferentiated instruction AcknowledgmentsWe would like to thank our three reviewers for the time and effort spent on review our manuscript.

The present paper argues that, given this principle of Abundancy, there is a Preface Paradox for (rational) credence. Section 1 gives a statement of the paradox, discusses its relation to its familiar counterpart for (rational) belief, and points out the congeniality between Abundancy and broadly contextualist trends in epistemology. This leads to the question whether considerations of context-sensitivity might lend themselves to solving the Preface for credence. Sections 2 and 3 scrutinize two approaches in this spirit—one mimicking Hawthorne’s (2002) Semantic Contextualist approach to an epistemic version of the Preface, the other one analogous to Clarke’s (2015) Sensitivist approach to the doxastic version—arguing that neither approach succeeds as it stands.</jats:p>",199,3-4,7303,7320,,,,,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11229-021-03115-6,,10.1007/s11229-021-03115-6,,,0,000-704-794-092-942; 005-998-580-742-039; 007-609-384-887-178; 008-840-792-152-873; 021-729-317-549-316; 022-275-778-632-350; 022-434-927-571-236; 029-535-429-019-796; 029-842-788-640-576; 032-190-204-233-537; 034-437-929-367-49X; 036-690-936-014-424; 050-172-582-463-392; 051-082-050-158-757; 054-458-681-774-857; 062-421-311-170-272; 064-831-730-842-429; 072-351-768-075-832; 103-026-686-034-176; 105-803-784-340-739; 111-822-078-751-312; 113-624-368-257-270; 129-609-464-396-110; 130-583-658-544-698; 130-841-570-007-854; 144-967-554-910-324; 145-259-341-619-970; 151-394-203-258-803; 151-881-823-379-321,0,true,cc-by,hybrid
180-325-800-270-010,It's All Relative: Interpretable Models for Scoring Bias in Documents,2023-07-16,2023,preprint,arXiv (Cornell University),,,,Aswin Suresh; Chi-Hsuan Wu; Matthias Grossglauser,"We propose an interpretable model to score the bias present in web documents, based only on their textual content. Our model incorporates assumptions reminiscent of the Bradley-Terry axioms and is trained on pairs of revisions of the same Wikipedia article, where one version is more biased than the other. While prior approaches based on absolute bias classification have struggled to obtain a high accuracy for the task, we are able to develop a useful model for scoring bias by learning to perform pairwise comparisons of bias accurately. We show that we can interpret the parameters of the trained model to discover the words most indicative of bias. We also apply our model in three different settings - studying the temporal evolution of bias in Wikipedia articles, comparing news sources based on bias, and scoring bias in law amendments. In each case, we demonstrate that the outputs of the model can be explained and validated, even for the two domains that are outside the training-data domain. We also use the model to compare the general level of bias between domains, where we see that legal texts are the least biased and news media are the most biased, with Wikipedia articles in between. Given its high performance, simplicity, interpretability, and wide applicability, we hope the model will be useful for a large community, including Wikipedia and news editors, political and social scientists, and the general public.",,,,,Interpretability; Computer science; Pairwise comparison; Artificial intelligence; Credibility; Natural language processing; Machine learning; Domain (mathematical analysis); Information retrieval; Inductive bias; Task (project management); Multi-task learning; Political science; Mathematics; Mathematical analysis; Management; Law; Economics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.08139,http://dx.doi.org/10.48550/arxiv.2307.08139,,10.48550/arxiv.2307.08139,,,0,,0,true,,green

Horner,"<jats:p>The violin and erhu are two of Western and Chinese music’s main bowed string instruments. Recent work has compared the different emotional characteristics between the violin and erhu on the Butterfly Lovers Concerto. In our study, we examine several hypotheses to investigate whether the previous studies’ results hold generally. Four musical excerpts were extracted from four famous Chinese and Western classical pieces, and the excerpts were divided into four emotional categories: Happy, Sad, Agitated, and Calm. Based on the Butterfly Lovers results, we expected that: (1) the violin has a more Happy emotional characteristic than the erhu, while the erhu is comparatively more Sad, and (2) the violin is better at conveying high-Arousal excerpts. We used the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) paired-comparison model to obtain the ranking scores and identify statistically significant differences between the two instruments. The erhu was consistently perceived as sadder than the violin for all Sad excerpts, while the violin was generally calmer and more agitated for those categories. Further study with more listeners and excerpts is needed to verify whether these results generally hold and at a statistically significant level.</jats:p>",152,4_Supplement,A55,A55,Violin; Musical; Style (visual arts); Acoustics; Violin musical styles; Statistical analysis; Piano; Art; Psychology; Visual arts; Mathematics; Physics; Statistics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/10.0015520,,10.1121/10.0015520,,,0,,0,false,,

This article presents the first meta-analysis of the association between self-enhancement and physical health (k = 87; N = 22,415). The meta-analysis relied predominantly on social desirability as an operationalization of self-enhancement and secondarily on comparative judgement and narcissism. Further, the meta-analysis operationalized physical health in terms of self-rated health, symptoms and biomarkers. Overall, self-enhancement yielded a near-zero association with physical health, r = .01. However, this association was more pronounced for comparative judgement (r = .18, k = 6) than social desirability (r = .03, k = 41) or narcissism (r = -.0001, k = 8), and for self-rated health (r = .09, k = 9) than symptoms (r = .01, k = 29) or biomarkers (r = -.13, k = 17).

Testing materials were 180 texts abridged from college English coursebooks, and raters were 90 advanced Chinese learners of L2 English. Forty‐five raters read paired texts and determined which text was harder to understand in each pair, and another 45 raters read paired texts and determined which text they read faster in each pair. Two stepwise linear regression models containing lexical, syntactic, and discoursal features explained 48.1% and 54.6% of the variance in L2 learners’ estimates of text comprehensibility and reading speed, respectively, outperforming four commonly used language readability models. These findings contribute useful insights into the relationship between linguistic complexity and L2 learners’ perception of text difficulty.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,National Office for Philosophy and Social Sciences,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/lang.12633,,10.1111/lang.12633,,,0,000-093-523-263-471; 001-629-401-150-03X; 002-222-103-961-426; 002-272-858-461-02X; 009-101-856-169-955; 010-174-179-167-815; 014-655-698-978-479; 017-624-168-018-697; 022-445-591-735-121; 025-085-917-871-91X; 028-564-516-243-979; 028-864-373-057-128; 029-760-593-482-695; 030-198-894-245-749; 035-676-794-449-862; 036-309-421-710-88X; 039-339-895-432-232; 042-508-425-495-223; 062-707-593-585-639; 068-124-584-046-362; 084-969-345-234-571; 096-852-020-963-262; 099-077-441-852-207; 103-295-685-550-852; 103-564-627-631-622; 108-072-324-159-181; 111-370-241-122-766; 115-325-355-666-131; 118-558-832-137-010; 118-847-885-300-724; 120-761-941-887-529; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-150-041-941-19X; 129-084-236-685-982; 129-568-798-992-213; 130-182-295-695-720; 148-673-033-661-432; 168-851-159-278-011,0,false,,

F. Kuipers,"<jats:title>Abstract</jats:title><jats:p>Examples of hypotheses about the number of planets are frequently used to introduce the topic of (actual) truthlikeness but never analyzed in detail. In this paper we first deal with the truthlikeness of singular quantity hypotheses, with reference to several ‘the number of planets’ examples, such as ‘The number of planets is 10 <jats:italic>versus</jats:italic> 10 billion (instead of 8).’ For the relevant ratio scale of quantities we will propose two, strongly related, normalized metrics, the proportional metric and the (simplest and hence favorite) fractional metric, to express e.g. the distance from a hypothetical number to the true number of planets, i.e. the distance between quantities. We argue that they are, in view of the examples and plausible conditions of adequacy, much more appropriate, than the standardly suggested, normalized absolute difference, metric.</jats:p><jats:p>Next we deal with disjunctive hypotheses, such as ‘The number of planets is between 7 and 10 inclusive is much more truthlike than between 1 and 10 billion inclusive.’ We compare three (clusters of) general ways of dealing with such hypotheses, one from Ilkka Niiniluoto, one from Pavel Tichý and Graham Oddie, and a trio of ways from Theo Kuipers. Using primarily the fractional metric, we conclude that all five measures can be used for expressing the distance of disjunctive hypotheses from the actual truth, that all of them have their strong and weak points, but that (the combined) one of the trio is, in view of principle and practical considerations, the most plausible measure.</jats:p>",,,,,Planet; Astrobiology; Mathematics; Astronomy; Physics,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10992-023-09739-y.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10992-023-09739-y,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10992-023-09739-y,,10.1007/s10992-023-09739-y,,,0,005-854-352-481-76X; 018-053-264-432-919; 037-681-813-889-783; 038-845-713-770-165; 052-215-934-504-937; 052-582-987-113-176; 065-906-081-314-123; 066-599-628-466-630; 141-367-942-838-645; 153-300-580-621-164; 153-645-904-849-549; 162-490-051-644-789; 174-554-526-394-046,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Moreover, instructors liked CJ and described it as a more practical, easier, fairer, faster, more enjoyable way of marking student papers.

Sabitha; A. S. Athulya; B. G. Sreedevi; V. S. Sanjay Kumar,"Inland waterways are one of the transportation alternatives available to the congested, highly crash-prone roads in Kerala. Though accidents are less compared to the road sector, several high-profile fatal boat accidents involving passenger boats, barges, and inland fishing boats have occurred recently. The major factors that cause risks to the safety of passengers and vessels are environmental conditions, nature of operations, human error, and lack of safety standards. This paper analyzes the factors involved in the safety of operation of inland waterways in Kerala and attempts to develop a waterway safety assessment model for categorizing the waterways for prioritization. The details of boats and accident data were collected, and a questionnaire survey was conducted at the major active zones of water transport. The different safety-related issues and their consequences were also studied. The analyzed information is used to prepare a waterway risk assessment model. The structure of the risk assessment model includes a linear combination of attributes, similar to a linear-additive value function, where each attribute is multiplied with a weight reflecting the importance of that attribute. After establishing the parameters for each risk-inducing factor, waterway-specific risk value is estimated by putting the risk values for that waterway for each variable into the risk model. This model can be used to categorize each waterway according to the safety and risks involved and thus to prioritize the waterway improvement decisions. Such a model is helpful to decision-makers who otherwise would make comparative judgments about risk informally.",,,163,179,Environmental science; Risk analysis (engineering); Business,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-16-9925-2_11,,10.1007/978-981-16-9925-2_11,,,0,022-020-976-103-05X; 052-862-141-356-576,0,false,,

Mostafa; Hayat E. Albloushy,"The term 'anthropomorphism' is derived from two Greek words signifying 'human form'. Anthropomorphism has recently received considerable academic attention. However, very limited previous research has addressed this topic cross-culturally. In this study, we fill this research gap by examining whether anthropomorphism affects consumers' comparative judgement in a cross-cultural setting involving Kuwait and the USA. Consistent with prior limited cross-national research on anthropomorphism, our results support the notion that consumers' comparative judgement is affected by anthropomorphised objects. Results also show that anthropomorphised objects elicit significantly different cross-cultural attitudes, lending strong support to the culture-specific hypothesis.

Therefore, participants were asked to indicate their preferences for all possible pairwise comparisons of 20 paintings (Experiment 1) and 20 faces (Experiment 2). Probabilistic choice models were fit to the resulting preference probabilities (requiring different degrees of stochastic transitivity), demonstrating that a ratio-scale representation of the liking of both paintings and faces can be derived consistently from the preference judgments. While the preference judgments of paintings were consistent with the highly restrictive Bradley-Terry-Luce model (Bradley and Terry, Biometrika 39:324-345, 1952; Luce, 1959), the liking of faces could be represented on a ratio scale only when accounting for face gender as an additional aspect in an elimination-by-aspects model. These ratio-scaled liking scores were then related to direct evaluative ratings of the same stimuli on a 21-point Likert scale, given both before and after the pairwise comparisons. It was found in both studies that evaluative ratings can be described accurately as a logarithmic function of the indirectly derived liking scores for both types of stimuli. The results indicate that participants are able (a) to consistently judge preferences across two heterogeneous stimulus sets, and (b) to validly report their liking in direct evaluative ratings, although the numeric labels derived from direct evaluative ratings cannot be interpreted at face value for ratio-scaled liking scores.",87,6,1953,1965,Psychology; Pairwise comparison; Social psychology; Transitive relation; Preference; Thurstone scale; Scale (ratio); Probabilistic logic; Statistics; Cognitive psychology; Mathematics; Developmental psychology; Combinatorics; Physics; Quantum mechanics,,"Humans; Emotions; Models, Statistical; Judgment; Probability",,HMU Health and Medical University GmbH,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s00426-022-01775-8.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s00426-022-01775-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-022-01775-8,36460871,10.1007/s00426-022-01775-8,,PMC10366322,0,004-703-894-331-147; 004-834-296-631-801; 005-879-470-000-235; 007-415-709-858-979; 007-957-907-323-007; 008-835-640-749-05X; 010-175-645-640-572; 011-206-786-696-647; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-011-603-102-596; 023-551-936-092-957; 024-848-286-367-819; 030-900-835-660-341; 031-779-699-577-483; 031-846-188-530-090; 032-475-413-638-046; 038-519-810-056-496; 041-706-379-743-767; 042-725-700-685-576; 047-828-307-223-520; 056-350-812-098-595; 058-753-642-787-273; 062-599-713-102-887; 066-672-675-643-378; 070-331-031-103-877; 072-187-659-986-619; 077-944-835-392-391; 084-218-372-658-68X; 084-616-607-461-755; 099-272-416-126-733; 103-214-891-273-609; 106-016-639-846-956; 117-341-991-234-105; 117-409-210-987-816; 118-106-052-893-600; 125-634-820-215-953; 130-109-930-540-402; 141-610-819-810-580; 167-210-770-656-121,0,true,cc-by,hybrid

Tawn; David Irons; Tim Paulden,"In most commonly used ranking systems, some level of underlying transitivity is assumed. If transitivity exists in a system then information about pairwise comparisons can be translated to other linked pairs. For example, if typically A beats B and B beats C, this could inform us about the expected outcome between A and C. We show that in the seminal Bradley-Terry model knowing the probabilities of A beating B and B beating C completely defines the probability of A beating C, with these probabilities determined by individual skill levels of A, B and C. Users of this model tend not to investigate the validity of this transitive assumption, nor that some skill levels may not be statistically significantly different from each other; the latter leading to false conclusions about rankings. We provide a novel extension to the Bradley-Terry model, which accounts for both of these features: the intransitive relationships between pairs of objects are dealt with through interaction terms that are specific to each pair; and by partitioning the $n$ skills into $A+1\leq n$ distinct clusters, any differences in the objects' skills become significant, given appropriate $A$. With $n$ competitors there are $n(n-1)/2$ interactions, so even in multiple round robin competitions this gives too many parameters to efficiently estimate. Therefore we separately cluster the $n(n-1)/2$ values of intransitivity into $K$ clusters, giving $(A,K)$ estimatable values respectively, typically with $A+K<n$. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, $(A,K)$ are treated as unknown, and inference is conducted via a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm. The model is shown to have an improved fit out of sample in both simulated data and when applied to American League baseball data.",,,,,Combinatorics; Pairwise comparison; Transitive relation; Bayesian hierarchical modeling; Inference; Extension (predicate logic); Outcome (probability); Reversible-jump Markov chain Monte Carlo; Intransitivity; Mathematics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12094.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210312094S/abstract http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2103.12094v1 https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.12094,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv210312094S/abstract,,,3136469616,,0,005-879-470-000-235; 007-786-155-612-362; 010-916-070-573-553; 017-165-193-545-368; 027-150-047-044-961; 027-354-819-104-27X; 028-769-387-497-655; 036-074-758-302-554; 037-465-023-279-589; 039-578-501-119-701; 046-186-229-688-198; 051-302-515-227-970; 054-898-405-742-807; 055-614-092-455-506; 056-899-758-617-718; 059-450-385-467-719; 063-070-383-385-322; 067-123-770-005-790; 072-187-659-986-619; 072-644-333-922-114; 073-922-137-240-11X; 086-632-355-539-415; 087-991-691-200-809; 112-304-417-559-285; 113-365-415-515-233; 123-248-831-556-464; 124-850-148-955-311; 129-140-863-196-364; 137-127-128-621-604; 182-002-660-211-823,0,true,,unknown

187-442-393-514-985,Travelers' Tales: Their Values and Virtues,2022-03-07,2022,journal article,History of Political Economy,00182702; 15271919,Duke University Press,United States,Mary S. Morgan,"As historians of economics, we are most used to dealing with the finished work of economists: the written words, diagrams, and math of those we study. Sometimes we are lucky enough to have research notes, diaries, or oral interviews, or to attend seminars. These are valuable resources from which we can learn more directly (than from their published pieces) how our subjects think about doing economics as they are doing it—or at least, very soon afterward. Their tales of traveling offer one such resource that enable us to capture that process, but it has its own especial characteristics. By studying their travel reports, the historian is led directly into economists' experiences of the economies they visited. We have an almost firsthand entry into what they saw, how they interpreted those impressions, and how they dealt with those experiences and reasoned with them to make sense of them. They enable us to see—in a certain direct way—not only into those travelers' modes of thinking qua economists but also into personal attitudes that illuminate for us as historians the different ways that traveling economists engaged with the places they traveled.1Let me use one of my own traveling experiences, one that gave rise to strong economic reflections, as an example. In 1981, I visited China, traveling in by train from Hong Kong and returning that same way. I still have vivid recall of China's city streets with no cars and only a few vans, but with many bicyclists carrying amazing loads balanced on their backs and shoulders, or in their carriers or panniers. I can see now in my mind our scheduled tourist visits to a textile factory producing the most beautiful white silken cloth, and our unscheduled side visits that included a small kiln in the midst of a field with perhaps ten workers shaping and baking clay into bricks. I can recall our Christmas Day visit to a citrus-growing commune (of sixty thousand people) where that day, we were told, was “a holiday,” and so village residents were making fireworks (cottage industry style) to sell in the town, rather than working in the orchards. (Strangely—as we were told—it seemed they always had a holiday on December 25!) But my most vivid memory, and most important economic insight from traveling (one that as you can see I repeat still), was what hit me on the trip back once we had crossed the border into Hong Kong. It was a Sunday, and I observed not just one, but several, giant earthmoving vehicles lying completely unused along the roadside. It was a moment of realization that this was the signal of a truly capitalist economy—real capital equipment so plentiful that it was idle in the streets.2 And it also caused me then to recall that for the past many days of my travels, I had seen, but not really noticed, that every bucket (even those with holes) was being used for something, every piece of corrugated iron was purposely protecting something. Anything that might be used as capital equipment was used: buckets with holes were real capital, and real capital (even such buckets) was in very short supply.This was casual tourist travel, not purposeful travel for economic insight; nevertheless it offers two poles for reflection for historical work. The first question focuses on what do economists see about the economy when they travel, what experiences do they notice in the new country or place? And following from that: What do economists learn about when they travel—the country they visit or the country they come from? The second question is to ask about the traveling economists' own standpoint: Do they remain outsiders, or can they gain some kind of insider knowledge? Is this just down to their personal attitude and behavior, or does it relate to their traveling purpose? And how do these relate to their actions as economists in their travels? These two reflective points—on what gets seen, and what gets done—are not necessarily unconnected.One of the main purposes of economists' travels, as discussed by historians in this special issue, can be understood as the fact-finding mission, that is, to go to a country as a stranger, look into the other space, and bring back information on that other territory to the home country. But the possibilities this entails are not straightforward (as my personal experience recounted above suggests). Perhaps the critical issues can be understood as matters of engagement, and of openness to comparative possibilities. The complexity of the historians' problems about how to recognize and interpret the evidence from these fact-finding activities is made manifest in Cooper's and Chao's articles, and might be framed in two different ways.First, it may be useful to note a distinction between looking and seeing, and so to (mentally) “ask”—about the traveling economist—not just “what did they report that they looked at,” but “what did they see” in the sense of what aspects of those phenomena did they take especial notice of, which caused them to pause and comment. This might entail not just noting differences but things they expected to be present in a landscape or situation but found absent. Phyllis Deane's travels in Africa in the 1940s are full of observations about the differences in local economic life that would make national income accounting categories misleading there (see Morgan 2011). Fact-finding travel seems to entail not only a kind of committed gaze from the traveler, but also an inquiring economic mind. The committed observer entails a purposeful outsider standpoint: the traveler is there to take note from the side; the inquiring mind requires an attitude not to take what is seen for granted and not to assume it would necessarily make sense at first sight. As we see in his article, Cooper's mining prospectors going to South America were clearly engaged outsiders, yet for some of them, their European standpoint, their mind's eye, shielded their ability to really see what was going on. They expected to see European mining methods and behaviors and technologies, and therefore judged what they saw according to those previous experiences and found the South American methods wanting. But one of Cooper's travelers, John Miers, gradually began to see those local practices in comparison with those back home. This is the starting point for useful comparative judgment by the traveling economic fact finder.But for historians of economics using these sources (as opposed to for Cooper's travelers), those comparisons might be multidimensional, and Chao's discussion certainly deepens our difficulties in assessing travelers' tales. First, his article compares the possibilities of insight of the one-way travelers carrying economic ideas from the West to China with the roundtrip students who later went West to bring back economic ideas into China. But there is a second path of traveling knowledge which opens up a different tranche of issues for comparisons. This he locates in the translations of economics texts that come directly into Chinese, compared to those that come indirectly—via Japanese—into Chinese (and are thus translated twice), with all their cultural attachments. Third, there is the changing notions of what that imported “economics” was understood to mean over time—from statecraft to science—as found in the texts and in the traveling accounts. Chao's account alerts us, as historians, to the importance of worrying about the stability in meanings of the words used in these accounts, independently of whether their writers were real travelers or not.Second, Cooper's and Chao's articles, in their different ways, raise issues about the role of comparisons: the value of the comparative gaze, not only for travelers at the time, but also for the work of historians of economics. Historians of economics have often focused on individuals, or perhaps schools, or even approaches, rather than geographical comparisons per se. In contrast, global economic history, which relies heavily on comparison, now asks historians not just to look at both similarities and differences between economies but to do so from both standpoints. Over the last twenty years, historical studies of the development of economies (not economic science or thought) have undergone a radical shift. They have, in two steps, moved from single-instance nation-based studies, to comparative studies between similar economies, to the method of “reciprocal comparison” (see, e.g., Austen 2007). The key question driving this final change was the observation that parts of China and parts of India were more technologically advanced in the seventeenth–eighteenth centuries than those parts of Northern Europe that experienced the so-called First Industrial Revolution. In the move away from nation-based histories, the historiographical literature refers back to Marc Bloch's (1953) seminal work on why comparative history is so important because it requires inquiry not just into the similarities between countries, but the differences, and particularly the absences, of phenomena, between countries.For economic travelers of any period on fact-finding missions, that reciprocal comparison injunction would be, indeed, stringent. It would ask travelers to have an insider-outsider, looking both ways, stance so that by seeing what happens and what works well elsewhere, they could also gain insight into their own country's economic activities, including why they do not see the same things in their home country. For us as historians of economics, we might look carefully at the way traveling economists used knowledge from both their country of visit and their country of origin, and analyze how they used the differences as much as the similarities in both countries as prompts to their insight, understanding, and knowledge. On this basis, one can have obvious doubts about how far Robinson in China or Jean-Baptiste Say in Great Britain made use of a comparative gaze, in contrast with Dutt in Europe (particularly in his visits to London).Say, according to Alain Alcouffe and David Le Bris's article, appears not even to have noticed some salient characteristics of the sites he was taken to see, whereas we might have expected more from a serious political economist traveling to a rival economy. Say's neglectful gaze can be measured against the wide notice taken and reported in the reactions and commentaries made by foreign visitors (including economists) on the “British Industrial Revolution.” These, surveyed by Giorgio Riello and Patrick O'Brien (2009), are suggestive about the variety of what was noticed and the importance of the comparative standpoint in those visitors, both in what they noticed, and what sense was made of it. (And in these respects, such travelers were not unlike the broader set of travelers reported on by Brian P. Cooper in South America.) Whereas some contemporary travelers saw exciting new technologies and industrial structures as marks of that revolution, others saw ghastly cities and work sites with exploited workers in terrible conditions barely fit for humankind. As Riello and O'Brien note, some of these Industrial Revolution–era travelers were known “political economists” of the day, others were industrialists, and both might be spies for technology secrets. In contrast, Say apparently saw little of economic note from his travels in Britain during the same period. We also know, from the current reciprocal comparison literature, that in the case of cotton textiles, where Say thought the French were ahead of the English (a hint of reciprocal comparison there), both are now thought by those global economic historians (above) to have been behind Asian products in terms of quality. The intriguing question for historians of economics might be to reflect not just on what economist-travelers like Say saw, and what sense they made of it, but also whether—in the light of economic historians' research—Say's traveling changed anything about his views of French industry and economy.The challenge for historians of economics is a different one when thinking about Robinson. As Mauro Boianovsky and Gerardo Serra's article shows, her view of her contemporary audience back home (and perhaps in the international arena), and her personal political commitments, are both clearly to be taken into account: these were upfront in her standpoint and thus engagement. (Hsiang-Ke Chao's Chinese travelers, in their own times, may have had equally strong personal commitments and audiences in mind.) These considerations aside, Robinson by ambition was a serious economist-traveler on fact-finding missions in her many visits to China (certainly compared to my own later tourist visit). Yet she gained bad press—for both her earlier trips to Russia and to China later—as not being a serious observer. Did she report through a particular rosy-glinted pair of spectacles for her audience back home, or did she just not see things that others felt must have been observable because her gaze was hindered by those political rose tints? Boianovsky and Serra are somewhat neutral on these questions. Yet, thinking about the comparative dimension, historians can still wonder: Did she use her travels to compare these communist or centrally planned economies? Did she perhaps rethink the nature of capitalism in Britain on her return? Or maybe her traveling experience affected her theorizing about capital in economics? Even if her travel observations on China seemed then, and now, to be judged awkward, might they still have proved fruitful for her as an active economist? In sum, how, if at all, did their traveling observations “broaden the economic mind” for either Say or for Robinson?Romesh Chunder Dutt's travels, as Maria Bach's article shows, are a kind of proof of this point, and take us back again to the value of reciprocal comparison. Dutt came to England with expectations about what he would see: expecting a kind of economic promised (imperial) land. He was not just disappointed but shocked (as were many of the earlier Industrial Revolution–era travelers before him) at the poverty, dirt, and squalor of the cities. He arrived in the mid-nineteenth century, before Charles Booth's great poverty study of London, but both Henry Mayhew, and Booth's later descriptions and accounts, corroborate the insight of Dutt's more casual observations. The latter immediately compared his traveling observations with his observations on poverty in his homeland. Indeed, Marc Bloch would have been most proud of Dutt's reciprocal comparisons, for they made him rethink not just his view of London (and England) but prompted him to rethink—even as he traveled—his understanding of poverty, famine, and economy in his native India. Dutt was an outsider to the European economies, and like many of those Industrial Revolution travelers, did not sit on the fence, but jumped down into the crowd. Bach's account of his diaries paints him as a traveler engaged with understanding all he could see; that engagement was driven by the comparing mind, thinking about India by standing in England, and thinking about England from his native Indian standpoint.Even if they did not stay long, some of the travelers appearing in this volume are unmistakably economists with missionary intentions that, almost by definition, exclude the virtues of reciprocal learning. Their standpoint is one of the outside expert bringing “good economics” to create change at the destination of travel.3 For them, it seemed, good economics came in the form of a recipe, a generic solution to a particular economic problem that could be used in these new contexts: “We know how to solve this problem, we have the recipe to do so.” The most obvious characters sharing this identity are Jan Tinbergen in Turkey, Wolf Ladejinsky in Asia, and Edwin W. Kemmerer in the Philippines. But I also want to introduce another comparator, Wolfgang Stolper in Nigeria. They all shared the belief that the economic recipe they each brought from the outside was the right one for the circumstances in the new country. As historians of economics, we can understand these institutional and policy recipes as technocratic ones—indeed a label perhaps the travelers would have understood for themselves. But for us as historians, we can see that they each came with different brand markings: such economic recipes may look purely technocratic, but first they were recipes of political economy, not just technical economics. And second, in using these recipes for intervention, these economists, of course, depended upon their experience and knowledge set. That experience and knowledge set in turn depended upon their personal insider or outsider standpoint: Did they rely just on outsider knowledge, or gain and use insider local knowledge?Kemmerer emerges from Rebeca Gomez Betancourt's historical account as the perfect example of a man on an economic mission. This was a conversion mission (not a fact-finding one). Kemmerer believed that the full gold standard was the best international economic exchange rate system of the time, that the gold exchange standard would piggyback onto that system, and so would be the best option for those colonies, ex-colonies, and quasi colonies in the formal and informal empires of the day (including the American ones). He had learned this “best recipe” at his graduate school, took it into the field, and continued to peddle it as he traveled though the field, though it was rarely a field, more likely a banking or political office. He did not seem to value the advantage of personal local experiential knowledge. And potentially important contextual differences in the economies he visited: for example, their trade patterns or access to base metals made no difference to his recipe and appeared not even to be noticed. Nor did he seem to appreciate the fact that perhaps the system was not even necessarily the best institution for the United States!4 As an economist, he came with a true belief in the magic of the gold standard and was determined to convert others to that true religion.This kind of missionary stance creates a different challenge for the historian than that presented by the case of Joan Robinson, who was “fact finding” to influence folks back home rather than seeking to interfere in the visited country. Given how prevalent this economic conversion missionary stance became after World War II, it is perhaps useful for the historian of economics to take note of contemporary commentaries on such traveling. Wilfred Beckerman, writing in 1956, in the context of the early usage of development plans in the field, focused on the importance of economic “know-how” in the economist's mission. But he argued that such know-how did not take you very far: economists' knowledge was highly fallible in application, so economists needed to be suitably modest in advice. Not so for Kemmerer: he carried the flag of the gold exchange standard into the field as the only valid monetary institution for a satellite economy and appeared to remain quite aloof from local interests, local circumstances, and local knowledge. Tinbergen, by contrast (on a development mission), had a technocratic approach that embedded a certain flexibility, a recipe for designing and planning development as we see in Erwin Dekker's article. Tinbergen introduced an institution-based blueprint, learned initially from his own experience of planning the Dutch economy after World War II. It involved both a technocratic planning apparatus and intersecting, democratic, political-economy committee structures designed to inform—for the particular economy he advised—the planning aims and decisions and the rollout of their (not his!) plan. At the same time, his theory of economic policy developed during the 1940s was an analytical framework to show the choices and use of economic targets and policy instruments in designing any planning system (see Morgan 2019).While Tinbergen, as traveling economist, over a period of years interacted on a regular basis with various countries such as Turkey and India, he remained ever aloof in those countries, importing his modes of technocratic institutional structures of planning and helping them into place in the importing country. Tinbergen's stance contrasts with other development economists of the period, who varied in their engagement with their destinations of travel. Even among his own team of collaborators, Tinbergen's stranger mode stood out while his team members engaged themselves in going to local markets, investigating the resources and industries, talking to locals, and so forth.5 More broadly, development-plan travelers of the postwar period ranged from outsiders with particular standpoints, to serial visitors, and to others we might consider resident (if somewhat temporary) insiders. Those on World Bank or IMF “missions” stayed briefly, and perhaps had little time for engagement beyond the local economic offices they had to visit—perhaps like Kemmerer before them. Their travels were circumscribed by full timetables of meetings and sometimes perhaps they never looked out the window! They had outsider standpoints, even though some briefly experienced the local economic life.At the other end of the local experience and engagement scale from both Kemmerer and Tinbergen was Wolfgang Stolper, who signed on as a Nigerian civil servant to create Nigeria's first five-year plan, and stayed over a two- to three-year period in 1960–62 at its point of independence.6 The historian reading his diaries finds that, unlike them both, he traveled around the Nigerian regions, wherever and whenever he could find an excuse to do so, he investigated every economic site he could find, and he made notes on them all. He used his local travel to gain local knowledge: to fill in the conditions and details of the context in order both to validate (or not) the statistical information he received and to test out the viability of certain plans (for often he found facts did not match claims), and sometimes his travels revealed things he had not even thought about. Stolper clearly became an insider but remained both a fact-finding traveler (in our earlier sense), as well as a missionary with a purpose from which, there is no doubt, he made outsider statistical and planning demands in his office work. His approach was even more flexible than Tinbergen's about the contents of the plan, the aims of the plan, and the importance of political choices; he understood his technocratic role as ensuring those political and economic choices were doable within the resources of the economy.Stolper's local travel investigations can be interpreted as a particular kind of missionary work, according to Hugh Fern (1959), writing from the “backward” economic periphery (the University of Ghana) in response to Beckerman (who wrote from “the center”: the OECD in Paris).7 Fern argued that successful missionary work depended not just on economic “know-how” (the technocratic recipe), but equally on “know-why,” understood as knowledge of the local context, ways of doing things and why they were done that way. For Fern, this knowledge was acquired from field reports—documentary reports made in the field about the field (e.g., by local civil servants, etc.), and from local surveys. This localized know-why knowledge was an essential complement to the generalized recipe knowledge of know-how. This brings us back to the importance of the active open gaze and open mind of the traveling economist who looks into the local habits of economic behavior sufficiently, as Fern suggests it, to acquire know-why knowledge of that local economy and why things work as they do and not in some other way. This know-why knowledge, he argued, would be critical to the ability of the technocratic missionary to get their recipe to work.Collecting such know-why knowledge was also a key feature of Ladejinsky's missionary work noted by Federico D'Onofrio and Hannah Tyler. In their account, he was another of the international experts, this time in agricultural economics, and like Tinbergen and Stolper, he was a serial missionary, carrying his own recipe, traveling place to place, and often with considerable time commitment. Unlike Tinbergen, but like Stolper, he traveled around the country talking to farmers and those in the agricultural sector. He had the right credentials—he was trained in the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), an organization that believed in fieldwork. His was investigative fieldwork—not idle sightseeing, and like Stolper, of the open-minded traveler kind, an outsider seeking insider knowledge.8 It remains unclear from his own accounts how far his traveling investigations and locally acquired knowledge altered his recipe; it may be right to say that the recipe was generic, and adjusted to the local circumstances, be they the Philippines or Japan or India. Over time, it seems, his success waned; maybe he found it difficult to update his recipe with local know-why knowledge, or perhaps his recipe was just not as usable in some places as in others.We might, as historians, recognize the importance, and acquisition, of know-why knowledge of the local environment as one important skill in the missionary. But the point of calling these economists missionaries is to pay attention also to the baggage they brought along with their technocratic recipes. Of course—as historians of economics know—such technocratic knowledge is not a view from nowhere. So, the point here is to take us back to the missionary elements in the technocratic ideas that economists bring with them. Tinbergen, Stolper, and Ladejinsky were all bringing an outsider know-how recipe into their work in the field, but their three know-how recipes were not understood by them as strictly exact universal technologies; on the contrary, they each in their own way were careful to think of how these would work in the local environment. In contrast, Kemmerer believed his monetary systems advice to be true objective economic knowledge. But in all four cases, we, as historians, might understand those recipes as having features of cultural artifacts, branded items carrying not just the economists' own name and the name of some international/national agency as the branding devices, but each individual carrying their own past traveling experiences with them. These recipes were not just technologies but recipes of political economy that came from particular times and places—and people.Tinbergen's planning recipe was forged in his experience of postwar reconstruction of the Dutch economy, in a very particular kind of local democratic environment. But equally, he brought into that recipe both his own strong political beliefs about how politics and economics interacted, and his econometric knowledge about how to analyze an economic system and the related possibilities and limitations on how to change that system. Both Stolper and Ladejinsky were migrants into the United States, which makes chasing the cultural artifactual elements of their recipes more difficult. Ladejinsky came with a recipe that seemed branded by his work within the USDA, for it favored small landowning in place of tenant farming or plantation cropping. A historian might speculate (but would need a lot more knowledge to make the claim fit) that he was exporting the recipe of the nineteenth-century American Homestead Acts, which in turn rested on the belief contemporary to those acts, that such an institution engendered its own virtuous mentality of productivity (and of course economic democracy). Stolper, by his own account, revered the democratic planning sensibilities of Tinbergen, but used them within an accounting-based approach to his planning recipe (which privileged regional aims over central ones for political purposes) rather than a structural macroeconometric approach using targets and instruments.A serious comparative history of the cultural artifactual elements—values in a broad sense—that missionary travelers brought into their recipes would be a tall order but perhaps illuminating. It would be the ideal addition to the insight that historians can gain into the notes and tales left by the traveling economists both those on missions of intervention and those on fact-finding missions.Leaving that wish list aside, the values of those travelers' notes remain for us, as historians, the possibility of gaining snapshots of how economists think about and adjust to new experiences. This is especially true of those travelers who practiced the virtues of the open gaze, the reflections of comparison, and followed their belief that there were local differences that matter. But even where those travelers seemed to have rather closed minds to their new sites of travel, or remained determinedly outsiders therein, those features themselves are important signals to historians and sources of insight into the work of the economists they study.I thank Harro Maas and Mauro Boianovsky for inviting me to the workshop for this special issue of HOPE and for their invitation to contribute these reflections.",54,3,571,583,Economics,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1215/00182702-9779684,,10.1215/00182702-9779684,,,0,004-829-655-106-165; 055-720-104-636-259; 060-050-759-623-273; 079-833-355-858-51X; 093-170-978-899-281; 109-882-391-379-628; 128-463-231-878-914,1,false,,

It draws on interview data from twelve mathematics educators who were experienced in assessing primary students' written responses to free response prompts covering a range of topics. The first stage of the interviews used a stimulated recall protocol that followed a comparative judgment procedure in which each participant was presented with pairs of students' written responses and asked to decide which was ‘better'. The second stage was semi-structured with questions about how participants made their comparative judgment decisions, and whether doing so improved their understanding of students' thinking.

First, the credit risk of enterprises in supply chain are divided into “self-own credit risk” and “credit risk contagion”. Second, the indicator system of self-own credit risk evaluation of enterprises in the supply chain is designed, and the fuzzy comparative judgment matrix of self-own credit risk evaluation indicator is obtained by using fuzzy preference relation, and the evaluation basic model of “self-own credit risk” is established. On the basis, the evaluation derivative model of “credit risk contagion” is established. Furthermore, by integrating the two kinds of evaluation results, the credit risk of enterprises in supply chain is evaluated comprehensively, and the contagion effect of associated credit risk in supply chain based on trade credit risk contagion (TCRC) is revealed.",199,,946,953,Credit risk; Supply chain; Supply chain risk management; Fuzzy logic; Computer science; Preference; Risk management; Business; Trade credit; Risk analysis (engineering); Actuarial science; Supply chain management; Economics; Finance; Service management; Microeconomics; Artificial intelligence; Marketing,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.procs.2022.01.119,,10.1016/j.procs.2022.01.119,,,0,005-692-926-370-972; 024-443-081-142-40X; 029-914-515-983-733; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-663-442-737-028; 046-300-790-327-984; 069-413-377-005-557; 072-446-793-475-522; 074-668-596-668-794; 143-904-987-699-443; 153-382-931-791-82X,3,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Currently, moderation is conducted at centre (school) level. This raises challenges for maintaining the standard across centres. Recent technological advances enable novel moderation methods that are no longer bound by centre. This study used simulation to investigate the feasibility of using comparative judgement (CJ) for moderating non-exam assessments. Our study explored the effects of CJ design parameters on the CJ estimates of script quality and how to assign moderator marks after the CJ procedure. The findings showed that certain design parameters had substantial effects on reliability and suggested minimum values for CJ protocols. The method used for assigning moderator marks maintained the rank order of scripts within centres and calibrated the centres to a common standard. Using CJ for moderation could transform current assessment practices, taking advantage of technological developments and ensuring reliability and fairness.",,,1,24,Judgement; Moderation; Psychology; Computer science; Mathematics education; Social psychology; Epistemology; Philosophy,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/0969594X.2024.2313237?needAccess=true https://doi.org/10.1080/0969594x.2024.2313237,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0969594x.2024.2313237,,10.1080/0969594x.2024.2313237,,,0,015-781-087-228-509; 022-486-381-437-418; 022-886-709-886-069; 036-417-407-984-911; 048-091-210-665-560; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-790-959-417-375; 144-470-591-189-747; 148-673-033-661-432; 163-379-589-157-078,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,hybrid

Here we show that subjects’ uncertainty can be modeled by the entropy of the psychometric function. As an application, we measured subjects’ uncertainty as they judged the relative contrast appearance of two stimuli in three different scenarios: subjects performed comparative judgments with either an attentional pre-cue for one stimulus (Experiment 1) or biased instructions to choose a post-cued stimulus (Experiment 2) or equality judgments (Experiment 3). We show that a quantitative description of subjects’ uncertainty can discriminate between different decision mechanisms that may lead to nearly identical psychometric functions, and that two indistinguishable uncertainty distributions can lead to different subjective reports, depending on the decision required. The results also show that attention can manipulate the decision mechanism without interfering with veridical perception.</p>",,,,,Stimulus (psychology); Psychology; Cued speech; Contrast (vision); Cognitive psychology; Audiology; Social psychology; Artificial intelligence; Medicine; Computer science,,,,,https://psyarxiv.com/hveac/download https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hveac https://osf.io/hveac/download https://osf.io/hveac/,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/hveac,,10.31234/osf.io/hveac,,,0,,0,true,,green

Adaptive comparative judgment of dance performances,2024-02-06,2024,journal article,Current Issues in Sport Science (CISS),24146641,University of Bern,,Eric Jeisy,"<jats:p>Introduction&#x0D;; Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ) is a promising digital assessment method that allows measurement of performance or competencies by repeated comparisons of two items. Whereas ACJ is becoming a popular assessment method in educational measurement there are no such studies or published use cases in the context of sport or physical education-related teacher education (Bartholomew &amp; Jones, 2022). To address this research gap, an explorative and comparative study was conducted to investigate whether ACJ offers an advantage over the traditional form of criteria-oriented scoring (TA) in the evaluation of students' dance performances.&#x0D;; Methods&#x0D;; In four face-to-face examinations the dance performances of 61 student teachers (82% female) were assessed by two lecturers in each case (n = 5; Age M = 50, 3 women, 2 men). Each lecturer scored independently on an 18-point scale on five different evaluation categories (e.g., technical quality). In addition, the dance performances were videotaped, and the same five lecturers assessed the dance performances again using the ACJ tool Comproved. To analyze interrater agreement and reliability, intraclass correlation (ICC) was calculated for the traditional assessment (Sato, 2022). The reliability of the ACJ was analyzed by calculating scale separation reliability (SSR; Verhavert et al., 2019). A Spearman’s rank correlation analysis was conducted to analyze whether there is a correlation between the ranked results of the two assessment methods. To assess the validity of the assessment methods, a focus group interview was conducted with the lecturers involved in the study.&#x0D;; Results and Discussion&#x0D;; Both assessment methods are characterized by very high and high reliability values (TA: ICC = 0.974, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.955-0.985 p &lt; .001; ACJ: SSR: 0.83, Ability [-5.97, 4.99], Misfit [-1.68, 1.34]). In particular, the ICC of the TA is higher than comparable results in dance research (Sato, 2022). There are doubts as to whether the lecturers really scored independently of each other at the face-to-face examinations. The ranked results of both methods correlate with a very strong effect (Spearman’s-Rho: rs -.818, p &lt; 0.001). However, detailed analyses show some differences. The answer to the question of who delivered the best dance performance differs depending on the assessment method. In addition, in the traditional assessment, many scores fall on a value at which the dance examination is just passed (10 points). The results of the focus group interview are still being analyzed and will be presented at the conference.&#x0D;; References&#x0D;; Bartholomew, S. R., &amp; Jones, M. D. (2022).

In this article, we introduce a lesser-known approach to translation assessment called <jats:italic>comparative judgement</jats:italic>. Rooted in psychophysical analysis, comparative judgement grounds itself on the assumption that humans tend to be more accurate in making relative judgements than in making absolute judgements. We conducted an experiment, as both a methodological exploration and a feasibility investigation, in which novice and experienced judges were recruited to assess English-Chinese translation, using a computerised comparative judgement platform. The collected data were analysed to shed light on the validity and reliability of assessment results and the judges’ perceptions. Our analysis shows that (1) overall, comparative judgement produced valid measures and facilitated judgement reliability, although such results seemed to be affected by translation directionality and judges’ experience, and (2) the judges were generally confident about their decisions, despite some emergent factors undermining the validity of their decision making. Finally, we discuss the use of comparative judgement as a possible method in translation assessment and its implications for future practice and research.</jats:p>",23,1,56,74,Judgement; Rubric; Reliability (semiconductor); Psychology; Perception; Computer science; Applied psychology; Mathematics education; Political science; Law; Power (physics); Physics; Quantum mechanics; Neuroscience,,,,China National Social Sciences Foundation,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1556/084.2022.00001,,10.1556/084.2022.00001,,,0,,0,false,,

However, his conception of measurement differs from later, representational conceptions in two main respects. Firstly, Helmholtz advocated an empiricist philosophy of arithmetic as grounded in some psychological facts concerning quantification. Secondly, his theory implies that mathematical structures are common to both subjective experiences and objective ones. My suggestion is that both of these differences depend on a classical approach to measurement, according to which the arithmetic laws of addition define what is measurable as a particular domain for their application, and, at the same time, the extensibility of these laws to all known physical processes works as a heuristic principle for empirical research. Such an approach is worth reconsidering, not only because it lends plausibility to some of the controversial aspects of Helmholtz’s theory, but also because it offers a philosophical perspective on quantification problems that originated in the nineteenth-century.</jats:p><jats:p>This paper draws insights on Helmholtz’s philosophical views from his engagement with the measurability of sensations via Fechner’s psychophysical law. This seems to be in contrast with the fact that the reception of Helmholtz’s theory culminated with the formulation of the theory of extensive measurement. I will contend that Helmholtz reached a no less important standpoint in the nineteenth-century debate on whether sensations are different (i.e., intensive) kinds of magnitudes and on how, if at all, they can be measured.</jats:p>",54,1,39,54,Helmholtz free energy; Epistemology; Philosophy of science; Perspective (graphical); Empiricism; Interpretation (philosophy); Nominalism; Philosophy; Theoretical physics; Calculus (dental); Mathematics; Sociology; Computer science; Physics; Artificial intelligence; Linguistics; Medicine; Dentistry; Quantum mechanics,,,,"Ministero dell’Istruzione, dell’Università e della Ricerca",https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10838-022-09605-6.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10838-022-09605-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10838-022-09605-6,,10.1007/s10838-022-09605-6,,,0,005-520-573-147-247; 014-266-509-021-661; 027-424-656-233-296; 045-935-017-507-438; 046-342-858-437-625; 046-579-510-839-960; 061-961-757-433-47X; 065-956-730-944-877; 073-553-979-598-846; 078-837-277-624-065; 104-460-396-318-03X; 108-485-271-938-59X; 110-909-426-804-915; 113-131-514-565-816; 116-276-350-400-56X; 122-396-034-113-650; 140-663-245-363-162; 149-752-221-065-517,1,true,cc-by,hybrid

There is a lot to learn about teacher’s assessment and grading of students in assignments that are related to technology, particularly in programming. Simon (2012) analyzed introductory programming exams and found that a large percentage of the marks were awarded for the product and the coding skills of the student and less for other skills such as design, debugging, testing, or explaining and documenting. To be able to give formative support teachers should also be able to assess the process in the classroom; students tinkering, creating, debugging, persevering, and collaborating. The aim of this paper is therefore to examine teachers’ individual criteria, explicit, tacit and subjective criteria, when they grade and assess students in technology tasks related to programming. We interviewed 6 teachers in Sweden, representing lower secondary school, upper secondary school and university (teacher and engineering education). A Repertory Grid Technique interview combined with a Comparative Judgement grading was used to examine teachers’ individual criteria in assessment. The expected outcomes from the methods are captured criteria that are implicit and based on teachers’ experience, sometimes seen as teachers’ gut feelings. Two types of criteria were found; product criteria assessing the program and process criteria assessing the ongoing process. We compared these criteria with an instrument measuring the development of creativity designed for Art education. We claim that the use of process criteria will help the teacher and the students in developing programming skills.",28,2,188,195,Creativity; Grading (education); Mathematics education; Psychology; Repertory grid; Judgement; Visual arts education; Formative assessment; Engineering education; Technology education,,,,,https://journals.oslomet.no/index.php/techneA/article/view/4332,https://journals.oslomet.no/index.php/techneA/article/view/4332,,,3169596734,,0,,0,false,,

We also investigate whether crowdsourcing second language learners’ rankings can be used for assigning levels to unseen vocabulary. The study is performed on Swedish single-word items.; The four hypotheses we examine are: (1) there is core vocabulary for each proficiency level, but this is only true until CEFR level B2 (upper-intermediate); (2) core vocabulary shows more systematicity in its behavior and usage, whereas peripheral items have more idiosyncratic behavior; (3) given that we have truly core items (aka anchor items) for each level, we can place any new unseen item in relation to the identified core items by using a series of comparative judgment tasks, this way assigning a “target” level for a previously unseen item; and (4) non-experts will perform on par with experts in a comparative judgment setting. The hypotheses have been largely confirmed: In relation to (1) and (2), our results show that there seems to be some systematicity in core vocabulary for early to mid-levels (A1-B1) while we find less systematicity for higher levels (B2-C1). In relation to (3), we suggest crowdsourcing word rankings using comparative judgment with known anchor words as a method to assign a “target” level to unseen words. With regard to (4), we confirm the previous findings that non-experts, in our case language learners, can be effectively used for the linguistic annotation tasks in a comparative judgment setting.</jats:p>",10,2,5,61,Crowdsourcing; Vocabulary; Relation (database); Core (optical fiber); Natural language processing; Computer science; Psychology; AKA; Artificial intelligence; Cognitive psychology; Linguistics; World Wide Web; Philosophy; Database; Library science; Telecommunications,,,,,https://journals.uni-lj.si/slovenscina2/article/download/11247/11900 https://doi.org/10.4312/slo2.0.2022.2.5-61,http://dx.doi.org/10.4312/slo2.0.2022.2.5-61,,10.4312/slo2.0.2022.2.5-61,,,0,015-790-677-411-471; 029-951-996-033-298; 034-539-721-046-387; 044-743-633-181-125; 046-621-736-424-983; 048-075-634-707-613; 050-520-914-652-439; 057-121-637-116-596; 059-499-588-119-340; 075-785-286-547-339; 089-461-851-854-436; 089-640-943-107-298; 095-798-329-771-073; 103-295-685-550-852; 107-274-521-365-16X; 110-620-120-298-186; 113-992-892-892-106; 118-684-649-570-075; 121-607-803-536-617; 129-084-236-685-982; 134-683-171-174-465; 165-287-624-915-183; 172-407-725-625-799; 175-367-440-188-797; 190-222-980-220-889,0,true,cc-by-sa,gold

Instead of providing absolute scores to a text as in holistic or analytic scoring methods, raters in comparative assessments rate text quality by comparing texts either to pre-selected benchmarks representing different levels of writing quality (i.e., benchmark rating method) or by a series of pairwise comparisons to other texts in the sample (i.e., comparative judgement; CJ). In the present study, text quality scores from the benchmarking method and CJ are compared in terms of their reliability, convergent validity and scoring distribution. Results show that benchmark ratings and CJ-ratings were highly consistent and converged to the same construct of text quality. However, the distribution of benchmark ratings showed a central tendency. It is discussed how both methods can be integrated and used such that writing can be assessed reliably, validly, but also efficiently in both writing research and practice.</jats:p>",15,3,497,518,Judgement; Benchmark (surveying); Reliability (semiconductor); Psychology; Rating scale; Reliability engineering; Computer science; Natural language processing; Engineering; Epistemology; Philosophy; Geography; Developmental psychology; Power (physics); Physics; Geodesy; Quantum mechanics,,,,,https://www.jowr.org/index.php/jowr/article/download/867/936 https://doi.org/10.17239/jowr-2024.15.03.03,http://dx.doi.org/10.17239/jowr-2024.15.03.03,,10.17239/jowr-2024.15.03.03,,,0,,0,true,cc-by-nc-nd,gold

Unravelling the interplay between teachers' beliefs, professional vision and reported practice of differentiated instruction",2022-04-22,2022,journal article,Educational Review,00131911; 14653397,Informa UK Limited,United Kingdom,Iris Roose; Wendelien Vantieghem; Ruben Vanderlinde; Piet Van Avermaet,"To ensure inclusion and equity in education, both teacher beliefs and practice are cited as influential. However, the connection between beliefs on student diversity and inclusive practice is often more complex than straightforward. Professional vision is theorised to be important in aligning beliefs with practice. Hence, this study investigates whether teachers’ professional vision of differentiated instruction (DI) mediates between teachers’ beliefs about teaching diverse learners and teachers’ practice of DI, and is unique in investigating these constructs in concert with each other. Data are part of the Potential-project and were collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (N = 461) in Flemish schools (N = 23). Survey data measuring teachers’ beliefs (i.e. growth mindset, professional beliefs about diversity and about differentiating the curriculum) and teachers’ self-reported DI practice were combined with video-based comparative judgement data measuring teachers’ professional vision of DI. Multilevel models show that both teachers with a more expert professional vision and less expert professional vision implement DI. For a more expert professional vision, beliefs about teaching diverse learners explain the association. For a less expert professional vision, teachers’ reflective and experimental practice explains the relationship. Results suggest that aspects of teachers’ competence are related in more complex ways than linear theoretical frameworks propose.

Across two studies, novices and experts assessing quality of reasoning through a forced-choice design were both able to choose arguments supporting more accurate solutions-62.2% (SE = 1%) of the time for novices and 74.4% (SE = 1%) for experts-and arguments produced by larger teams-up to 82% of the time for novices and 85% for experts-with high inter-rater reliability, namely 70.58% (95% CI = 1.18) agreement for novices and 80.98% (95% CI = 2.26) for experts. We also explored two methods for increasing efficiency. We found that the number of comparative judgments needed could be substantially reduced with little accuracy loss by leveraging transitivity and producing quality-of-reasoning assessments using an AVL tree method. Moreover, a regression model trained to predict scores based on automatically derived linguistic features of participants' judgments achieved a high correlation with the objective accuracy scores of the arguments in our dataset. Despite the inherent subjectivity involved in evaluating differing quality of reasoning, the forced-choice paradigm allows even novice raters to perform beyond chance and can provide a valid, reliable, and efficient method for producing quality-of-reasoning assessments at scale.",,,,,Two-alternative forced choice; Quality (philosophy); Computer science; Normative; Reliability (semiconductor); Artificial intelligence; Scale (ratio); Cognitive psychology; Natural language processing; Machine learning; Psychology; Philosophy; Power (physics); Physics; Epistemology; Quantum mechanics,Automatic reasoning assessment; Comparative judgment; Forced choice; Quality of reasoning; Reasoning,,,Intelligence Advanced Research Projects Activity (16122000002),https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/s13428-023-02234-x.pdf https://doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02234-x,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-023-02234-x,37833511,10.3758/s13428-023-02234-x,,,0,000-962-149-101-705; 002-012-269-176-043; 002-513-714-986-809; 004-148-393-063-260; 007-001-956-461-442; 008-770-633-009-382; 014-843-811-593-617; 016-741-978-283-43X; 017-557-775-828-301; 021-738-595-719-412; 021-881-546-370-738; 022-318-883-592-669; 025-575-171-863-279; 026-108-915-930-82X; 027-107-459-007-709; 030-883-497-548-282; 035-966-099-589-64X; 045-983-278-288-102; 046-258-415-988-362; 049-380-171-166-642; 050-964-049-709-126; 055-311-068-073-921; 063-016-434-402-368; 064-748-003-390-705; 072-956-640-402-621; 086-025-032-367-204; 100-601-161-869-786; 117-963-554-982-320; 147-967-958-591-306,0,true,cc-by,hybrid
