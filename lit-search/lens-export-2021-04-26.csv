000-031-367-034-146,The basal ganglia in perceptual timing: timing performance in Multiple System Atrophy and Huntington's disease.,2013-10-14,2013,journal article,Neuropsychologia,18733514; 00283932,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Thomas E. Cope; Manon Grube; Baldev Singh; David J. Burn; Timothy D. Griffiths,"The timing of perceptual events depends on an anatomically and functionally connected network comprising basal ganglia, cerebellum, pre-frontal cortex and supplementary motor area. Recent studies demonstrate the cerebellum to be involved in absolute, duration-based timing, but not in relative timing based on a regular beat. Conversely, functional involvement of the striatum is observed in relative timing, but its role in absolute timing is unclear.; ; This work tests the specific role of the basal ganglia in the perceptual timing of auditory events. It aims to distinguish the hypothesised unified model of time perception (Teki, Grube, & Griffiths, 2012), in which the striatum is a mandatory component for all timing tasks, from a modular system in which they subserve relative timing, with absolute timing processed by the cerebellum.; ; Test groups comprised individuals with Multiple System Atrophy, a disorder in which similar pathology can produce clinical deficits associated with dysfunction of the cerebellum (MSA-C, n=8) or striatum (MSA-P, n=10), and early symptomatic Huntington's disease (HD, n=14). Individuals with chronic autoimmune peripheral neuropathy (n=11) acted as controls.; ; Six adaptive tasks were carried out to assess perceptual thresholds for absolute timing through duration discrimination for sub- and supra-second time intervals, and relative timing through the detection of beat-based regularity and irregularity, detection of a delay within an isochronous sequence, and the discrimination of sequences with metrical structure.; ; All three patient groups exhibited impairments in performance in comparison with the control group for all tasks, and severity of impairment was significantly correlated with disease progression. No differences were demonstrated between MSA-C and MSA-P, and the most severe impairments were observed in those with HD.; ; The data support an obligatory role for the basal ganglia in all tested timing tasks, both absolute and relative, as predicted by the unified model. The results are not compatible with models of a brain timing network based upon independent modules.",52,100,73,81,Psychology; Neuroscience; Time perception; Basal ganglia; Cerebellum; Striatum; Huntington's disease; Atrophy; Supplementary motor area; Perceptual Disorders,Basal ganglia; Beat; Huntington's disease; Multiple System Atrophy; Perceptual timing,"Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Basal Ganglia/physiopathology; Female; Humans; Huntington Disease/complications; Male; Multiple System Atrophy/complications; Perceptual Disorders/etiology; Statistics, Nonparametric; Time Factors; Time Perception/physiology",,Wellcome Trust (091593) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091681) United Kingdom,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393213003412 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393213003412 http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/197801/FDD230F9-FA61-4B1C-8C27-B6F42CF60435.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/pmid/24135486/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3905186 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/197801 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3905186/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81941727.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.09.039,24135486,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2013.09.039,2774782774,PMC3905186,0,000-609-150-090-997; 002-835-004-941-149; 004-401-190-499-335; 005-281-876-349-30X; 005-285-622-509-236; 006-556-515-196-690; 007-292-929-089-350; 007-599-970-098-44X; 007-801-916-993-52X; 007-984-949-991-402; 008-146-338-695-878; 008-299-448-366-482; 009-544-643-325-689; 010-046-951-773-276; 011-432-515-912-139; 012-943-988-371-150; 014-027-440-367-649; 014-803-226-209-294; 014-828-023-028-347; 014-950-140-680-405; 018-754-075-286-950; 019-490-776-168-383; 019-535-383-706-319; 020-441-134-826-481; 020-512-833-958-294; 020-846-248-424-62X; 020-921-618-805-268; 021-371-921-725-474; 022-130-405-731-391; 022-393-453-528-042; 022-676-363-300-343; 023-728-595-953-237; 024-620-805-669-579; 024-943-753-334-49X; 025-868-348-105-086; 026-005-079-528-621; 026-322-519-796-814; 026-599-904-652-501; 026-760-282-205-990; 028-787-329-139-066; 029-582-367-526-339; 029-866-270-253-340; 030-554-798-784-61X; 032-912-723-334-921; 033-213-101-928-470; 035-926-525-104-056; 036-468-943-687-486; 042-987-190-174-505; 043-202-114-476-003; 046-228-291-907-921; 046-587-058-028-749; 047-214-037-947-345; 047-781-183-432-148; 047-930-087-747-314; 049-522-689-772-656; 052-084-760-946-884; 054-262-694-329-790; 057-721-314-186-599; 058-407-336-920-900; 058-591-382-887-825; 059-644-665-214-332; 059-964-976-808-720; 061-204-281-009-906; 061-233-856-565-552; 061-381-296-273-328; 061-848-813-662-863; 063-261-845-448-335; 063-926-482-822-28X; 066-854-652-371-119; 067-033-829-394-657; 069-620-151-333-728; 069-683-787-506-768; 071-188-013-298-92X; 071-904-188-966-680; 072-393-717-795-341; 075-369-892-283-107; 077-316-978-661-205; 077-669-636-893-608; 078-733-223-580-910; 082-255-695-900-573; 083-569-951-314-812; 091-082-799-878-087; 094-076-530-928-529; 100-620-451-959-345; 100-831-059-726-280; 101-079-163-911-033; 103-271-705-625-975; 103-411-069-157-833; 104-054-147-558-100; 109-101-533-725-641; 110-665-528-475-288; 124-631-899-598-431; 126-805-854-642-275; 128-216-915-841-145; 135-654-207-256-336; 136-184-679-956-309; 137-552-089-661-159; 138-581-409-543-83X; 144-522-905-985-255; 165-368-291-823-196; 167-747-237-523-259; 168-545-591-011-425; 172-356-416-017-610; 173-567-380-739-959,52

Given the importance of optimism for adaptive functioning, surprisingly little is known about resting brain states underlying optimistic and depressive tendencies. In the current study, two resting-state indices were used to examine the neural correlates of default mode network (DMN) and optimistic and depressive tendencies in a nonclinical young adult sample. Due to the self-referential nature of DMN, the analysis was constrained within it. Across different indices, bilateral superior frontal gyri of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and bilateral superior medial frontal gyri of the dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (DMPFC) play a key role in maintaining optimistic tendencies of spontaneous self-evaluations. Conversely, decreased activity in DLPFC and bilateral medial orbitofrontal cortices (OFC) are related to accentuated depressive symptoms. Together, results highlight the pivotal roles of the DLPFC and DMPFC in mediating valences of self-referential content.",9,,618,618,Neural correlates of consciousness; Default mode network; Psychology; Neuroscience; Optimism; Young adult; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Prefrontal cortex; Self evaluation; Resting state fMRI,default mode network; depression; optimism; resting-state; self-evaluation,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://doaj.org/article/e30dec4a12fe4c3291c89b8763354b9d http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4649049 https://core.ac.uk/display/43880219 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00618/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26635573 https://philpapers.org/rec/WUTNC http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00618/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82843395.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00618,26635573,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00618,2175671888,PMC4649049,0,001-054-289-773-274; 001-425-642-447-964; 002-964-932-874-007; 003-680-334-505-764; 005-340-266-406-124; 006-006-893-678-631; 006-018-916-077-352; 006-911-748-520-969; 008-159-122-229-707; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-735-289-529-609; 014-516-996-096-757; 015-542-128-816-289; 017-573-256-674-072; 018-757-245-440-011; 019-883-350-101-293; 020-383-619-224-46X; 020-557-527-719-219; 022-567-398-110-07X; 030-972-195-025-042; 033-009-098-614-033; 034-166-452-633-508; 034-967-067-231-043; 035-466-534-087-345; 035-898-775-946-429; 036-698-985-016-73X; 037-158-379-540-944; 039-900-956-980-496; 040-178-400-125-267; 041-491-501-058-507; 043-935-327-751-230; 047-775-510-354-386; 050-378-697-572-349; 053-453-309-651-034; 054-186-441-981-674; 054-208-181-435-179; 055-087-209-591-252; 055-101-158-106-509; 055-876-431-733-102; 058-049-644-454-692; 059-305-264-094-150; 060-765-100-611-724; 061-082-122-262-098; 065-578-305-492-659; 066-255-227-146-08X; 069-104-481-684-167; 070-448-009-249-529; 071-637-558-385-75X; 082-706-498-272-66X; 083-094-538-274-558; 084-488-285-659-756; 085-580-305-628-673; 086-711-040-036-739; 094-112-039-690-982; 096-740-195-311-569; 101-449-787-467-247; 103-481-648-304-635; 107-854-421-865-889; 109-760-962-476-435; 122-886-850-738-052; 128-294-469-198-287; 132-145-626-508-070; 132-937-990-592-892; 146-110-334-622-902; 152-611-253-187-593; 164-914-489-861-533,10

The study was carried out with 444 students chosen from 9th, 10th, 11th and 12th grade students in four different types of secondary education in Mersin. The case V and case III models of the scaling method based on Thurstone's (1927) Law of Comparative Judgment, which can be applied in cases where the items can be given to participants in pairs, are used to answer the research questions. As a result of the research, it was determined that students adopting both deep and superficial learning approaches prefer the questions measuring the skills at remembering level with higher chance success such as matching, true or false and multiple choice in the first place, performance tasks and long answer questions in the last place while determining their academic success.

Katsikopoulos; Gerd Gigerenzer,"People violate expected utility theory and this has been traditionally modeled by augmenting its weight-and-add framework by nonlinear transformations of values and probabilities. Yet individuals often use one-reason decision-making when making court decisions or choosing cellular phones, and institutions do the same when creating rules for traffic safety or fair play in sports. We analyze a model of one-reason decision-making, the priority heuristic, and show that it simultaneously implies common consequence effects, common ratio effects, reflection effects, and the fourfold pattern of risk attitude. The preferences represented by the priority heuristic satisfy some standard axioms.

However, this instrument does not specify the information-processing resources needed for task performance. The MRQ offers a tool to measure the workload associated with vigilance assignments in which such resources can be identified.Method:Two experiments were performed in which factors known to influence task demand were varied.

Our multicomponent framework facilitates synthesis judgments on single issues of pressing concern to policymakers, in particular, how mandatory vaccination policies motivate people to vaccinate. We consider the impact of each component of our framework on persons who remain unvaccinated for different reasons, including complacency, social disadvantage, and more or less committed forms of refusal. Context In response to outbreaks of vaccine-preventable disease and increasing rates of vaccine refusal, some political communities have recently implemented coercive childhood immunization programs, or they have made existing childhood immunization programs more coercive. Many other political communities possess coercive vaccination policies, and others are considering developing them. Scholars and policymakers generally refer to coercive immunization policies as ""vaccine mandates."" However, mandatory vaccination is not a unitary concept. Rather, coercive childhood immunization policies are complex, context-specific instruments. Their legally and morally significant features often differ, and they are imposed by political communities in varying circumstances and upon diverse populations. Methods In this paper, we introduce a taxonomy for classifying real-world and theoretical mandatory childhood vaccination policies, according to their scope (which vaccines to require), sanctions and severity (which kind of penalty to impose on vaccine refusers, and how much of that penalty to impose), and selectivity (how to enforce or exempt people from vaccine mandates). Findings A full understanding of the operation of a vaccine mandate policy (real or potential) requires attention to the separate components of that policy. However, we can synthesize information about a policy's scope, sanctions, severity, and selectivity to identify a further attribute-salience-which identifies the magnitude of the burdens the state imposes on those who are not vaccinated. Conclusion Our taxonomy provides a framework for forensic examination of current and potential mandatory vaccination policies, by focusing attention on those features of vaccine mandates that are most relevant for comparative judgments.",97,4,978,1014,Public economics; Conceptual framework; Business; Salience (language); Vaccination; Mandate; Sanctions; Childhood immunization; Childhood vaccination; Politics,,,,Australian Research Council; Government of Australia (DE190100158),https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31529546/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31529546 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/childhood-vaccination-mandates-scope-sanctions-severity-selectivi https://www.milbank.org/quarterly/articles/childhood-vaccination-mandates-scope-sanctions-severity-selectivity-and-salience/ https://philpapers.org/rec/ATTCVM https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/1468-0009.12417,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1468-0009.12417,31529546,10.1111/1468-0009.12417,2973401564,PMC6904257,0,001-938-805-554-881; 004-369-885-727-229; 006-519-454-281-644; 007-844-419-733-268; 007-872-459-754-694; 008-280-725-295-054; 010-022-669-942-754; 011-154-136-272-883; 011-225-297-084-459; 012-947-655-291-222; 014-227-418-645-688; 020-844-587-241-554; 024-907-486-645-593; 026-710-319-367-34X; 030-967-352-501-035; 032-205-299-707-22X; 038-109-638-585-49X; 039-129-377-407-330; 041-841-264-421-487; 042-791-002-178-097; 045-466-376-313-775; 048-658-351-666-22X; 051-728-781-777-818; 057-467-795-257-448; 060-205-355-964-913; 060-654-122-690-185; 061-040-904-251-451; 062-473-130-799-199; 068-391-894-122-347; 074-316-958-885-026; 074-823-155-289-892; 075-678-087-746-067; 082-406-641-140-498; 097-888-602-388-094; 100-209-831-463-202; 101-608-914-124-702; 106-066-485-409-088; 107-211-090-784-582; 115-635-614-330-75X; 129-046-916-747-190; 144-063-077-825-87X; 152-866-682-461-620; 160-694-434-591-33X; 189-588-143-978-343; 191-195-089-444-221,13

The present study investigated the shelter colour preference of M. rosenbergii postlarvae (age 15–18 days after metamorphosis) in the laboratory. Shelter occupancy tests were performed on four groups of 200 postlarvae in four 57-l aquaria, into which were placed shelters made of rigid coloured netting sewn into four-layered cubes open on two sides. The shelters were presented in six colour pairs: black vs dark green, black vs light green, black vs blue, dark green vs light green, dark green vs blue, and light green vs blue. Colour preference was tested six times for each colour pair. The data obtained were analyzed using Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment. The mean z-score was significantly highest (i.e., highest preference) for the black shelter. Vision was involved in the detection of and approach to the shelter. When released in aquaria, intact-eyed individual postlarvae directly approached the shelter straight away, whereas blind postlarvae (paint over the eyes) swam around randomly and occupied the shelter only after accidental contact much later. Postlarvae in open water out of the shelter exhibited frequent aggressive contact, while those in the shelter were quiescent. The use of black shelters in rearing tanks is thus recommended for reducing stress and aggression among M. rosenbergii postlarvae in the hatchery.",83,2,259,264,Animal science; Macrobrachium rosenbergii; Prawn; Hatchery; Netting; Open water; Fishery; Biology,,,,,https://repository.seafdec.org.ph/handle/10862/3227 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12562-017-1062-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12562-017-1062-8,,10.1007/s12562-017-1062-8,2575597373,,0,002-835-538-544-009; 004-652-190-728-173; 007-328-059-604-591; 011-248-162-323-733; 015-297-684-420-457; 017-279-756-972-853; 017-857-563-921-912; 019-079-935-427-830; 027-959-439-206-663; 034-592-036-171-107; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-856-134-781-190; 040-719-828-285-05X; 043-535-500-348-38X; 049-584-516-205-833; 050-826-822-373-522; 051-004-911-171-205; 051-131-641-992-418; 051-288-624-893-464; 061-751-973-942-476; 067-339-423-946-759; 074-158-192-586-215; 076-265-750-328-672; 078-178-938-066-034; 085-326-424-262-359; 085-878-345-888-789; 090-968-806-262-309; 100-558-026-818-774; 105-495-711-167-179; 111-606-802-262-880; 113-062-263-667-781; 115-653-000-869-768; 122-137-161-920-838; 125-524-470-103-961; 143-713-343-193-592; 155-246-484-983-85X; 162-763-120-081-512; 173-427-346-790-350,5

We assessed tumour and necrotic content in lung tumour specimens from AC and SCC patients and aimed to identify possible implications for the suitability of these samples in molecular characterisation studies using next generation sequencing technology.",8,11,S2,S1348,Internal medicine; Oncology; Lung cancer; Non small cell; Radiotherapy treatment; Radiation therapy; Weight loss; Medicine; Dosimetry; Receptor tyrosine kinase; Proto-oncogene tyrosine-protein kinase Src; Janus kinase; MAP kinase kinase kinase; Platelet-derived growth factor receptor; ROR1; Cancer research; Medicine; Bruton's tyrosine kinase; Mitogen-activated protein kinase kinase; Cell biology; Pathology; Non small cell; Arsenic; Medicine; Interleukin 6; Internal medicine; Oncology; Interleukin-6 receptor; Interleukin 24; Lung cancer; Cancer research; Medicine; Interleukin 15; Internal medicine; Pathology; Oncology; Observational study; Clinical Practice; Egfr mutation; Medicine; Cell therapy; Immunology; Lung cancer; Immunotherapy; Immune recognition; Cancer stem cell; Medicine; Adoptive cell transfer; Lung cancer; Chemotherapy; Tyrosine-kinase inhibitor; Non small cell; Anti angiogenesis; Anti angiogenic; Tyrosine kinase; Cancer research; Medicine; Meta-analysis; Thymidylate synthase; Downregulation and upregulation; Molecular biology; In vitro; In vivo; Lung cancer; Arsenic trioxide; Non small cell; Medicine; Internal medicine; Oncology; Cell; Lung cancer; Lung; Adenocarcinoma; Lung tumours; Molecular analysis; Basal cell; Cancer research; Necrosis; Medicine; Kinase; Lung cancer; Drug candidate; Cancer research; Medicine; Internal medicine; Oncology; Mesothelioma; Alliance; Prognostic models; Medicine; Blood proteins; Pleural mesothelioma; Proteomics; Cancer research; Medicine,,,,,https://research.bond.edu.au/en/publications/dosimetric-factors-associated-with-weightloss-during-radiotherapy https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:344310 http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30093245 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82428480.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/01.jto.0000438438.14562.c8,,10.1097/01.jto.0000438438.14562.c8,2221104360; 765645917; 2216115939; 2245163628; 2602667159; 2248537629; 2787803019; 2244147957; 2416258653; 1454535317; 292064216; 2803440806,,0,,17

Maloney,We assess four common claims concerning the two-interval forced choice (2-IFC) procedure and the standard Difference Model of 2-IFC performance. The first two are (1) that it is unbiased and (2) that the structure of the 2-IFC task does not in itself alter sensitivity. The remaining two concern a claimed ffiffiffi 2 p enhancement in sensitivity in 2-IFC relative to that measured in a Yes–No task. We review relevant past research and re-analyze seventeen experiments from previous studies across three laboratories. We then report an experiment comparing 2-IFC performance with performance in a second task designed to elucidate observers’ decision processes. This second task is simply two successive Yes–No signal detection tasks with the same timing as in the 2-IFC experiment. We find little evidence supporting the claims that 2-IFC is unbiased and that it does not alter sensitivity and we also reject the two claims associated with the Difference Model as a model of performance in our own experiment.,48,17,1837,1851,Two-alternative forced choice; Statistics; Detection theory; Psychophysics; Psychology; Decision process,,"Algorithms; Choice Behavior; Discrimination, Psychological; Humans; Models, Psychological; Models, Statistical; Psychophysics; Sensitivity and Specificity; Signal Detection, Psychological",,NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY008266) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016200) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY016200) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY08266) United States,https://core.ac.uk/display/82604196 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698908002599 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/bias-and-sensitivity-in-two-interval-forced-choice-procedures-tes https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18585750 http://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/YeshurunCarrascoMaloney_2008.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5839130 https://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/YeshurunCarrascoMaloney_2008.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82604196.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2008.05.008,18585750,10.1016/j.visres.2008.05.008,2162115549,PMC5839130,0,005-251-864-553-226; 006-096-159-866-189; 006-791-051-768-178; 011-424-266-639-679; 012-066-657-144-146; 014-485-476-529-652; 018-447-351-353-882; 018-835-513-079-324; 021-309-154-919-595; 021-312-584-746-070; 021-641-693-706-622; 031-843-770-067-771; 042-145-911-499-49X; 045-749-063-674-254; 051-621-639-545-979; 056-600-005-793-064; 061-504-363-564-748; 063-161-468-666-442; 075-663-388-719-976; 077-701-296-137-386; 082-839-230-083-437; 084-245-591-695-02X; 085-391-765-861-326; 095-303-984-882-389; 096-185-251-747-528; 105-771-799-257-782; 112-241-088-783-255; 113-286-538-807-265; 132-023-599-983-670; 134-589-821-529-459; 136-792-624-826-16X; 147-360-774-999-912; 158-909-424-597-942; 159-194-489-256-073; 182-179-568-932-39X; 187-463-359-716-48X; 199-055-961-488-187,103

This synthesis is brought about by a dynamisation of classical structuralism, with an abductive inference rule and base generated revisions in the style of Rott (2001). The formalism of prioritised default logic (PDL) serves as the medium of the synthesis. Why seek to integrate the Sneed formalism into belief revision theory? With the hybrid system of the present investigation, a substantial simplification of the ranking information that is necessary to define revisions and contractions uniquely is achieved. This system is, furthermore, expressive enough to capture complex and non-trivial scientific examples. It is thus closely related to a novel research area within belief revision theory which addresses the dynamics of scientific knowledge.",20,2,205,232,Epistemology; Semantics; Belief revision; Defeasible reasoning; Non-monotonic logic; Default logic; Abductive reasoning; Sociology of scientific knowledge; Mathematics; Formalism (philosophy),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9580/1/structuralist_theory_submission.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1969163 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9580/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jolli/jolli20.html#Andreas11 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11923529.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3,,10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3,2109565636,,0,012-169-656-547-674; 015-489-641-949-592; 016-010-403-716-426; 016-149-127-818-130; 016-767-183-012-594; 018-374-056-110-760; 022-684-229-427-044; 022-754-452-317-471; 022-921-914-706-750; 026-618-674-853-498; 028-445-394-328-998; 030-834-774-216-948; 030-934-754-845-50X; 032-079-127-973-164; 036-178-901-774-500; 040-030-462-418-793; 047-154-012-405-29X; 048-864-279-505-700; 050-129-694-983-356; 051-780-172-791-081; 053-437-282-659-633; 053-467-600-852-453; 055-522-961-847-096; 059-996-900-937-514; 060-776-007-121-361; 080-770-812-047-65X; 085-455-289-826-182; 089-777-515-684-379; 097-650-179-395-034; 108-949-615-435-260; 110-723-990-997-177; 114-906-979-944-514; 121-960-896-069-92X; 140-601-577-639-803; 152-797-528-041-875; 158-124-631-059-784; 162-960-722-341-10X; 168-904-118-052-397; 178-226-411-455-462; 184-804-601-553-580; 193-914-737-522-349,7

Researchers investigate the ability of subjects to discriminate between dot arrays, as a function of the ratio or distance between their numerosities. Such studies have contributed significantly to the number sense theory (i.e., that humans are born with the ability to process numerosities, and share this ability with various species)—possibly the most influential theory in numerical cognition literature today. However, a dot array contains, in addition to numerosity, continuous properties such as the total surface area of the dots, their density, etc. These properties are highly correlated with numerosity and therefore might influence participants’ performance. Different ways in which different studies choose to deal with this confound sometimes lead to contradicting results, and in our opinion, do not completely eliminate the confound. In this work, we review these studies and suggest several possible reasons for the contradictions in the literature. We also suggest that studying continuous properties, instead of just trying to control them, may contribute to unraveling the building blocks of numerical abilities.",4,,375,375,Stimulus (physiology); Artificial intelligence; Numerosity adaptation effect; Number sense; Cognitive psychology; Dot array; Magnitude processing; Computer science; Numerical cognition,ANS; continuous; discrete; magnitude processing; non-symbolic stimuli; number sense; numerical cognition; visual properties,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00375/full http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23805121 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00375/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23805121 http://core.ac.uk/display/27150993 https://philpapers.org/rec/LEIMPI http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00375/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82838899.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00375,23805121,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00375,2136629759,PMC3691512,0,000-774-598-960-961; 001-499-673-641-104; 002-743-317-587-306; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-783-682-084-833; 006-548-790-016-05X; 007-402-735-113-601; 010-449-936-863-472; 013-254-779-044-236; 016-227-375-936-145; 022-406-497-332-711; 023-290-232-151-661; 027-735-008-156-622; 029-066-516-364-812; 034-781-820-914-931; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-080-984-994-496; 038-395-026-012-885; 038-870-853-400-558; 039-555-369-773-746; 041-398-777-156-814; 042-410-478-356-272; 042-793-844-821-092; 052-384-764-371-189; 054-748-721-247-986; 062-048-899-665-467; 064-535-670-863-140; 067-036-764-376-645; 074-927-200-217-174; 075-167-330-041-32X; 089-534-827-525-987; 092-568-831-144-646; 101-767-153-820-233; 102-755-968-592-356; 106-936-931-089-579; 115-962-254-198-270; 117-150-975-353-778; 129-827-356-327-594,69

Fransen; Edith G. Smit; Peeter W.J. Verlegh,"Persuasion is an important element of human communication. But in many situations, we resist rather than embrace persuasive attempts. Resistance to persuasion has been studied in many different disciplines, including communication science, psychology, and marketing. The present paper reviews and connects these diverse literatures, and provides an organizing framework for understanding and studying resistance. Four clusters of resistance strategies are defined (avoidance, contesting, biased processing, and empowerment), and these clusters are related to different motivations for resisting persuasion (threat to freedom, reluctance to change, and concerns of deception). We propose that, while avoidance strategies may be triggered by any of these motivations, contesting strategies are linked primarily to concerns of deception, while empowerment and biased processing strategies are most common when people are reluctant to change.",6,1201,1201,1201,Psychology; Reactance; Element (criminal law); Empowerment; Deception; Persuasion; Human communication; Social psychology,change; deception; persuasion; reactance; resistance,,,,https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/strategies-and-motives-for-resistance-to-persuasion-an-integrativ https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F9f6d65a5-b0f8-4b76-b29a-5fc10470d5d8 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201/abstract https://dare.uva.nl/personal/search?identifier=e8f80135-96cd-42fb-bd7d-d51365b50770 https://doaj.org/article/4eb3ecc1c6304f45b0d106759c9ea1f1 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/86222012 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4536373 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201/full https://pure.uva.nl/ws/files/2593697/170955_506610.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26322006 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82855431.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201,26322006,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01201,1958658927,PMC4536373,0,000-918-928-885-23X; 002-975-624-225-877; 003-069-415-508-477; 003-327-327-254-066; 005-617-792-871-826; 005-898-839-300-638; 005-969-867-429-901; 007-334-726-783-759; 007-829-933-790-497; 007-902-623-285-717; 009-976-028-322-119; 011-460-675-006-504; 012-270-712-436-343; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-015-171-251-052; 013-836-630-510-411; 014-933-975-865-550; 015-475-547-173-305; 016-153-945-208-539; 019-346-629-012-104; 019-829-847-595-332; 021-430-446-205-96X; 021-438-596-406-325; 021-965-861-454-526; 023-363-986-179-235; 023-402-050-303-103; 024-479-683-212-756; 027-236-881-938-251; 028-146-068-523-165; 028-378-097-773-043; 029-786-717-216-352; 030-885-013-573-051; 033-332-096-791-300; 033-484-123-455-701; 033-644-977-916-399; 035-466-534-087-345; 036-030-274-316-648; 036-220-344-666-895; 040-220-990-026-010; 040-269-259-341-705; 042-504-039-690-460; 044-056-756-887-561; 047-834-699-542-31X; 047-846-864-288-22X; 048-357-862-324-863; 050-336-422-260-340; 050-786-163-382-519; 052-505-530-866-160; 053-284-167-763-537; 053-465-583-771-66X; 054-630-698-080-087; 055-093-143-507-134; 055-789-072-612-257; 057-347-543-375-273; 057-761-715-276-049; 063-225-190-754-113; 063-713-695-406-555; 064-890-145-058-772; 066-067-212-448-503; 069-482-352-551-075; 072-053-630-576-233; 072-752-833-915-197; 072-978-121-958-617; 072-996-011-927-720; 073-081-085-530-583; 075-329-675-400-155; 075-478-608-167-794; 079-239-586-839-824; 080-790-209-595-190; 082-671-206-179-838; 082-683-095-561-847; 083-359-911-231-97X; 084-710-776-545-213; 085-386-932-729-01X; 086-582-799-183-592; 088-670-887-230-38X; 089-371-232-400-567; 090-449-704-046-870; 091-863-549-560-289; 092-636-335-385-258; 097-674-478-207-917; 098-672-115-646-766; 108-288-978-851-209; 108-831-556-084-662; 118-139-149-370-778; 125-476-469-867-426; 126-206-948-527-951; 126-568-545-267-524; 129-900-968-763-010; 130-792-744-228-705; 133-615-216-407-672; 134-287-809-759-215; 138-611-442-101-018; 143-586-887-476-778; 146-640-494-507-530; 149-062-701-263-063; 156-083-835-454-363; 158-246-532-542-741; 159-140-351-574-550; 161-343-184-977-863; 161-855-979-924-49X; 163-172-090-123-460; 164-348-318-964-024; 164-742-415-341-49X; 172-490-198-653-762; 187-965-882-590-770; 193-927-201-553-430,48

However, risk measures can be viewed as instances of upper (or lower) previsions, thus letting us apply the theory of imprecise previsions to them. After a presentation of some well known risk measures, including Value-at-Risk or VaR, coherent and convex risk measures, we show how their definitions can be generalized and discuss their consistency properties. Thus, for instance, VaR may or may not avoid sure loss, and conditions for this can be derived. This analysis also makes us consider a very large class of imprecise previsions, which we termed convex previsions, generalizing convex risk measures. Shortfall-based measures and Dutch risk measures are also investigated. Further, conditional risks can be measured by introducing conditional convex previsions. Finally, we analyze the role in risk measurement of some important notions in the theory of imprecise probabilities, like the natural extension or the envelope theorems.",49,1,159,174,Statistics; Time consistency; Convex analysis; Imprecise probability; Econometrics; Generalization; Risk analysis (business); Risk management; Mathematics; Financial risk; Value at risk,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82631279 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2972364 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijar/ijar49.html#Vicig08a https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401291 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X07001338 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82631279.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2007.06.009,,10.1016/j.ijar.2007.06.009,1992438271,,0,000-073-231-893-254; 000-217-390-110-173; 006-539-674-203-304; 022-514-907-123-778; 022-819-142-468-404; 027-745-294-420-402; 039-650-162-527-463; 040-692-674-064-248; 046-862-395-031-651; 047-349-419-416-564; 048-128-123-635-087; 054-506-646-981-619; 061-307-214-265-880; 068-926-087-240-142; 071-333-783-733-957; 074-125-162-418-973; 076-599-593-366-017; 078-368-076-079-583; 088-940-866-381-557; 095-248-429-329-403; 114-179-845-018-453; 120-875-606-655-347; 121-933-599-254-981; 135-767-102-249-763; 137-746-258-971-883; 148-184-674-526-137; 181-741-629-157-93X; 188-464-353-939-712; 196-393-219-430-629,19

The academic environment – where there is a tacit consensus on the interdisciplinary character of such an approach, on the perpetual relevance within the various (sub)disciplines, and on the somewhat exhaustion of the subordinated debates – remains subtly divided on a series of theoretical delimitations or historical evidence. This article aims to highlight a (sub)domain of the comparative analysis regarding the economic systems in which the literature is not as polarized as it is rarefied: what roots and reverberations does “social responsibility” have within the main economic systems and where and how its “ecological sustainability” component manifests itself? The present research targets to critically and originally review, in a “bioeconomic” key, the way in which social responsibility underlying sustainability is perceived, penetrated and practiced within pure liberal capitalism / market economy, canonical socialism / command economy, and real-world interventionism / mixed economy, offering both a priori insights and empirical illustrations.",21,52,707,707,Positive economics; Social responsibility; Ideology; Planned economy; Political science; Utopian socialism; Mixed economy; Socialism; Capitalism; Interventionism (politics),,,,,https://www.amfiteatrueconomic.ro/temp/Article_2849.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/aes/amfeco/v21y2019i52p707.html http://www.amfiteatrueconomic.ro/temp/Article_2849.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.24818/ea/2019/52/707,,10.24818/ea/2019/52/707,2968553805,,0,001-088-055-910-892; 003-055-103-993-576; 005-914-440-174-630; 012-127-968-827-661; 019-008-112-675-536; 034-757-561-878-63X; 044-421-009-481-528; 055-127-219-449-931; 069-114-752-790-391; 139-264-136-995-933; 156-208-441-443-940,2

Utilizing the high temporal resolution of electroencephalography (EEG) in a passive oddball adaptation paradigm, we compared event-related brain potentials (ERPs) evoked by unattended shape changes and unattended numerosity changes. We controlled visual stimulus properties in a stringent manner. Unattended changes in shape elicited significant, gradual adaptation effects in the range of early visual components, indicating the fast and automatic processing of shapes. Changes in numerosity did not elicit significant changes in these early ERP components. The lack of early number-specific effects was qualified by a significant interaction between Shape and Number conditions. Number change elicited gradual ERP effects only on late ERP components.

Wyer,"Stimulating people to state a preference for one of two commercial products can increase their willingness to purchase not only one of these products, but also other products in a totally unrelated domain. However, willingness to make a purchase in a given domain (e.g., computers) can also be increased by asking individuals (a) to indicate which of two stimuli in a different domain (e.g., vacation packages) they dislike more, (b) to compare the relative attractiveness of wild animals, (c) to compare the animals with respect to physical attributes, and (d) to estimate how similar one object is to another. Moreover, the effects generalize to decisions about dating partners, as well as consumer products. In short, making any type of comparative judgment appears likely to give rise to a comparative-judgment mind-set and, therefore, to influence decisions in subsequent situations.",19,9,859,864,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Randomized controlled trial; Consumer behaviour; Courtship; Persuasive communication; Attractiveness; Social psychology,,"Animals; Animals, Wild; Choice Behavior; Commerce; Consumer Behavior; Courtship; Culture; Generalization, Psychological; Humans; Intention; Judgment; Likelihood Functions; Motivation; Persuasive Communication; Students/psychology",,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02169.x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18947350/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18947350 https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdfplus/40065006.pdf https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02169.x http://acrwebsite.org/volumes/v36/naacr_vol36_172.pdf https://experts.umn.edu/en/publications/the-comparative-mind-set-from-animal-comparisons-to-increased-pur https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-47485,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02169.x,18947350,10.1111/j.1467-9280.2008.02169.x,2096582767,,0,018-731-441-274-449; 041-202-184-970-389; 043-141-102-769-961; 046-243-812-882-439; 054-659-050-166-83X; 068-565-988-746-967; 070-990-464-548-408; 070-994-355-143-741; 075-900-511-923-187; 090-023-370-872-145; 091-627-492-949-124; 094-713-974-945-580; 099-388-040-143-950; 100-996-584-039-521; 106-840-973-238-716; 116-566-191-011-393; 153-986-337-473-199; 169-750-697-452-033; 180-983-078-311-317; 189-953-224-914-934; 190-086-181-064-265; 192-602-811-579-724,52

First, is there a difference between the representations of the numerical and the physical properties of visually presented numbers? Second, can the relevancy of the dimension change its representation? In a numerical Stroop task, participants were asked to indicate either the physically or the numerically larger value of two digits. The ratio between the physical sizes and the numerical values changed orthogonally from 0.1 (the largest difference) to 0.8. Reaction times (RT) were plotted as a function of both physical and numerical ratios. Trend analysis revealed that while the numerical dimension followed Weber's law regardless of task demands, the physical ratio deviated from linearity. Our results suggest that discrete and continuous magnitudes are represented by different yet interactive systems rather than by a shared representation.",4,,369,369,Trend analysis; Artificial intelligence; Stroop effect; Computer science; Numerical cognition; Modulation; Magnitude (mathematics); Linearity; Arithmetic,Weber's law; comparative judgment; numerical Stroop; numerical cognition; ratio,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/25868057 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3693217 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3693217/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00369/full https://philpapers.org/rec/LEITIO-9 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00369/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82872021.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00369,23805117,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00369,2151747521,PMC3693217,0,000-495-638-642-502; 001-244-253-407-376; 001-499-673-641-104; 002-953-676-947-858; 004-451-533-015-01X; 007-402-735-113-601; 007-926-410-139-923; 010-449-936-863-472; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-227-375-936-145; 023-290-232-151-661; 025-273-714-276-887; 027-735-008-156-622; 032-176-592-076-025; 037-054-632-717-760; 038-395-026-012-885; 043-288-458-558-686; 044-195-320-428-495; 055-643-503-860-593; 060-748-407-187-900; 071-057-839-637-721; 072-033-671-901-532; 072-388-177-868-565; 075-167-330-041-32X; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-272-102-076-652; 097-168-070-287-368; 101-767-153-820-233; 120-204-913-104-353; 155-712-203-046-639,12

However, these tests produce ipsative data which have undesirable properties, thereby making an inappropriate application of classical factor analysis techniques for psychometric evaluation commonly used by researchers. This paper explains the analytical properties of forced-choice tests, along with an example that illustrates how these properties have an impact on the application of conventional statistical techniques and produce improper results. Additionally, one of the current proposals is presented in order to analyze these data based on the comparative judgment model by Thurstone, along with the results of a simulation study which illustrates its implementation and effectiveness in recovering the original factor structure.",46,1,24,34,Thurstone scale; Psychology; Psychological testing; Acquiescence; Social desirability; Factor structure; Social psychology; Ipsative,,,,,http://www.redalyc.org/pdf/805/80532607003.pdf https://biblat.unam.mx/en/revista/revista-latinoamericana-de-psicologia/articulo/analisis-factorial-de-items-de-respuesta-forzada-una-revision-y-un-ejemplo https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Revista_Latinoamericana_De_Psicologia/publication/267325471_Anlisis_factorial_de_tems_de_respuesta_forzada_una_revisin_y_un_ejemplo/links/544a61c20cf2fc851ede7555.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5031220 https://www.elsevier.es/es-revista-revista-latinoamericana-psicologia-205-articulo-analisis-factorial-items-respuesta-forzada-S0120053414700032 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0120053414700032 http://www.scielo.org.co/pdf/rlps/v46n1/v46n1a03.pdf https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/665303 http://www.scielo.org.co/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&pid=S0120-05342014000100003 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0120-0534(14)70003-2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0120-0534(14)70003-2,,10.1016/s0120-0534(14)70003-2,2069844353,,0,003-234-442-173-306; 004-414-436-917-174; 010-637-180-131-244; 011-325-175-516-004; 012-250-676-081-224; 015-891-513-768-549; 016-926-000-460-104; 017-320-989-281-086; 018-093-885-932-859; 032-171-661-043-68X; 034-367-396-258-90X; 034-947-330-978-630; 035-442-340-528-935; 035-586-436-180-18X; 036-806-031-318-759; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-645-459-184-264; 043-209-749-101-784; 046-039-497-858-085; 053-763-049-855-754; 087-620-967-733-76X; 092-595-088-242-701; 095-679-078-470-732; 102-693-982-590-25X; 118-832-212-382-786; 120-836-425-113-053; 123-501-236-238-353; 123-600-993-524-166; 140-723-378-190-113; 174-620-706-345-658,4

This paper reviews existing research on this controversy and attempts to unify the evidence within a framework where expertise is utilised in the form of comparative judgement. Initially, the paper introduces a mathematical model for the way in which comparative judgement may operate. Data from existing studies of comparative judgement are then used to estimate suitable parameters for this model. Having derived a working mathematical model for the operation of expert judgement, the paper will then demonstrate that this model provides results that are broadly consistent with existing research, including both studies that are critical and studies that are supportive of the use of expert judgement. The model will then be applied to examine the required scale and design of expert-driven approaches to standard maintaining in order for the...",31,3,352,376,Statistical model; Psychology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Secondary education; Statistical analysis; Expert judgement; Management science; Mathematical model,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1099334 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,,10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,2008316232,,0,001-776-625-574-472; 005-302-356-483-011; 006-459-131-027-623; 006-809-268-879-517; 007-381-818-286-903; 012-834-407-111-308; 017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-969-129-433-746; 043-208-094-772-83X; 045-347-578-027-687; 046-885-708-774-897; 056-004-643-676-048; 065-049-495-011-823; 066-718-263-808-78X; 074-502-843-992-015; 076-050-960-166-845; 087-991-691-200-809; 110-976-899-414-79X; 129-560-099-381-900; 145-779-409-320-756,2

Patterson; Susanne Quadflieg,"Through advances in production and treatment technologies, transparent glass has become an increasingly versatile material and a global hallmark of modern architecture. In the shape of invisible barriers, it defines spaces while simultaneously shaping their lighting, noise, and climate conditions. Despite these unique architectural qualities, little is known regarding the human experience with glass barriers. Is a material that has been described as being simultaneously there and not there from an architectural perspective, actually there and/or not there from perceptual, behavioral, and social points of view? In this article, we review systematic observations and experimental studies that explore the impact of transparent barriers on human cognition and action. In doing so, the importance of empirical and multidisciplinary approaches to inform the use of glass in contemporary architecture is highlighted and key questions for future inquiry are identified.",6,,1381,1381,Architecture; Evidence-based design; Psychology; Cognition; Systematic review; Multidisciplinary approach; Data science; Perception; Multidisciplinary review; Engineering ethics; Transparency (graphic),evidence-based design; extra-personal space; multisensory integration; translucency; transparency,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4569749 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/47928721/2015Marquardt_Frontiers.pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381/full https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F145066 https://works.bepress.com/miles-patterson/8/ http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/6775/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381/pdf https://researchers.mq.edu.au/en/publications/there-or-not-there-a-multidisciplinary-review-and-research-agenda https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26441756 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/157342/ https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/145066 https://philpapers.org/rec/MARTON-4,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381,26441756,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01381,1918265213,PMC4569749,0,000-283-194-038-042; 000-465-760-297-848; 000-722-820-145-577; 000-826-180-301-565; 000-840-699-744-62X; 000-883-948-788-456; 002-688-499-668-027; 003-162-033-774-784; 003-693-654-225-967; 003-709-013-562-203; 004-017-176-266-790; 004-021-791-042-811; 004-218-468-633-282; 004-796-573-826-742; 004-845-235-373-005; 005-628-790-710-766; 005-717-653-367-716; 006-942-140-111-35X; 007-512-475-177-226; 007-826-604-450-957; 007-860-787-851-540; 008-015-949-841-731; 008-473-532-230-490; 009-570-898-882-638; 009-873-925-924-863; 010-157-246-466-15X; 011-230-281-441-315; 012-009-930-912-927; 012-327-308-125-097; 012-673-175-153-298; 012-740-117-785-550; 012-918-775-993-816; 014-449-703-075-913; 014-458-927-384-883; 015-600-844-704-838; 015-737-131-260-816; 015-900-543-581-330; 016-214-683-750-702; 016-860-578-917-968; 017-025-564-622-242; 017-504-662-057-775; 018-005-962-920-497; 018-426-369-071-24X; 019-126-881-206-264; 019-342-638-024-58X; 020-627-147-789-523; 023-145-353-986-461; 023-586-808-693-395; 024-490-170-201-610; 025-349-312-805-174; 025-694-515-162-778; 025-941-387-554-376; 026-775-975-140-01X; 027-635-158-763-964; 027-946-188-331-327; 028-336-855-078-619; 028-652-815-998-503; 028-999-655-262-611; 031-419-393-857-408; 031-473-227-457-166; 032-241-791-332-472; 032-693-891-640-330; 033-019-737-707-818; 033-785-715-909-067; 034-197-103-606-917; 034-213-120-146-526; 034-710-166-249-595; 034-802-050-456-435; 034-808-788-607-823; 034-965-536-087-584; 035-174-705-127-360; 035-202-547-218-587; 035-225-370-597-834; 036-073-558-442-486; 036-167-873-449-714; 036-595-032-118-575; 037-023-414-016-155; 037-584-991-251-956; 039-745-680-356-301; 039-881-449-244-514; 040-436-249-619-801; 040-854-810-191-786; 040-934-245-040-079; 042-045-712-256-526; 042-061-286-379-055; 042-131-536-352-076; 042-311-644-916-965; 042-447-347-469-276; 042-511-997-547-030; 042-735-453-795-477; 043-961-866-946-597; 046-947-178-535-573; 047-116-933-879-118; 048-367-303-926-517; 049-806-124-278-882; 053-790-286-594-432; 055-065-848-581-141; 058-754-950-302-615; 058-944-062-128-863; 059-381-572-307-378; 059-645-581-466-967; 061-132-008-407-612; 061-137-785-570-839; 062-916-707-131-688; 062-917-496-655-24X; 063-298-063-447-281; 063-384-830-992-696; 065-650-890-847-476; 066-292-785-506-089; 066-807-026-398-785; 068-929-505-096-491; 072-603-939-753-887; 077-134-077-825-869; 079-757-241-966-748; 080-159-469-422-443; 080-336-475-026-839; 081-242-104-641-794; 082-618-839-056-448; 084-868-239-881-924; 087-419-138-713-628; 089-817-825-726-742; 090-730-607-270-330; 091-183-980-423-629; 093-841-315-126-565; 094-877-327-378-840; 095-868-354-894-172; 096-923-483-253-756; 096-956-738-143-606; 099-830-919-105-17X; 101-409-054-722-523; 102-050-615-521-536; 105-467-410-296-913; 105-553-910-478-300; 111-639-077-766-859; 111-954-475-213-440; 114-735-837-052-621; 114-752-026-306-055; 115-089-242-139-069; 115-587-692-247-579; 117-792-820-427-917; 119-040-019-352-084; 122-870-374-430-009; 123-044-946-232-967; 123-372-742-921-982; 129-018-726-726-438; 129-226-470-506-840; 132-990-522-696-300; 134-904-964-386-43X; 136-816-606-924-552; 143-350-051-102-580; 144-477-353-644-523; 154-088-140-798-610; 155-057-554-553-458; 165-138-448-113-798; 167-408-128-917-797; 175-777-961-304-054; 177-240-904-127-103; 181-514-412-944-369; 181-735-592-857-906; 194-650-394-139-339,5
001-819-542-723-636,Two paradigms of measuring serial-order memory: two different patterns of serial-position functions.,2010-07-04,2010,journal article,Psychological research,14302772; 03400727,Springer Verlag,Germany,Jerwen Jou,"There are two research paradigms in the area of serial-order memory. One typically uses serial recall (accuracy), and the other comparative judgment (reaction time) for measuring serial-order memory. Spontaneous subgrouping is commonly observed in the recall serial-position function in the form of multiple bowings. However, comparative judgment with a reaction time measure produces a single-bowing function. Researchers adopting these two approaches have opposing views on the form of the structure of serial-order memory with the former favoring a hierarchical, and the latter a unidimensional structure. The present study confirmed the above hypothesized relation between the two measuring procedures and the two different patterns of serial-position functions. It was suggested that a serial recall involves retrieving absolute position information, whereas a comparative judgment involves retrieving relative position information, and that subgrouping serves a facilitating function for the former, but may actually impede the latter process.",75,3,202,213,Recall; Serial position effect; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Social psychology,,Analysis of Variance; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Linear Models; Memory/physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Reaction Time/physiology; Serial Learning/physiology; Young Adult,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-010-0297-0/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-010-0297-0 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-010-0297-0 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20607283,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-010-0297-0,20607283,10.1007/s00426-010-0297-0,2091713106,,0,002-287-259-826-156; 005-327-076-606-022; 005-374-265-419-666; 011-060-968-966-450; 011-241-859-967-967; 012-883-006-918-347; 013-209-296-309-874; 013-913-789-186-066; 014-171-475-020-617; 016-000-197-860-064; 016-333-888-925-627; 019-313-788-423-049; 020-700-035-081-350; 021-377-820-314-868; 021-698-951-149-265; 022-956-817-434-95X; 023-121-589-521-859; 023-909-015-053-340; 025-225-372-308-431; 027-957-537-714-574; 028-943-224-220-011; 030-025-420-771-477; 032-075-851-758-344; 034-781-306-561-379; 036-064-104-461-266; 037-379-498-186-385; 038-448-987-314-707; 039-183-865-928-263; 039-553-674-410-459; 042-974-807-587-578; 045-179-545-761-535; 046-704-584-908-041; 047-116-933-879-118; 052-866-251-783-016; 055-132-086-156-743; 058-571-827-675-115; 059-813-693-127-775; 061-556-739-571-730; 064-004-764-377-896; 065-323-391-455-728; 068-691-637-820-536; 069-912-468-484-895; 071-145-496-706-667; 072-028-777-560-506; 073-126-510-872-864; 084-277-600-615-738; 086-993-701-614-697; 088-555-553-457-409; 088-615-980-891-455; 089-789-025-857-271; 094-087-384-386-015; 094-517-447-463-549; 095-181-566-198-75X; 107-149-357-486-572; 109-926-662-069-886; 112-951-625-047-533; 116-146-035-021-855; 118-738-628-718-086; 124-257-870-583-335; 124-844-977-980-177; 125-382-726-486-898; 128-327-492-428-122; 135-766-163-319-329; 139-536-364-453-550; 139-708-795-933-36X; 142-158-215-351-756; 148-214-528-359-814; 156-762-273-363-770; 168-240-237-531-64X; 176-017-510-665-867; 177-226-574-421-404; 182-283-604-664-354,3

Randall; Wan Cheung Cheung; Iñaki Sanz; F. Eun-Hyung Lee,"Antibody responses to viral infections are sustained for decades by long-lived plasma cells (LLPCs). However, LLPCs have yet to be characterized in humans. Here we used CD19, CD38, and CD138 to identify four PC subsets in human bone marrow (BM). We found that the CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) subset was morphologically distinct, differentially expressed PC-associated genes, and exclusively contained PCs specific for viral antigens to which the subjects had not been exposed for more than 40 years. Protein sequences of measles- and mumps-specific circulating antibodies were encoded for by CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs in the BM. Finally, we found that CD19(-)CD38(hi)CD138(+) PCs had a distinct RNA transcriptome signature and human immunoglobulin heavy chain (VH) repertoire that was relatively uncoupled from other BM PC subsets and probably represents the B cell response's ""historical record"" of antigenic exposure. Thus, our studies define human LLPCs and provide a mechanism for the life-long maintenance of anti-viral antibodies in the serum.",43,1,132,145,Antigen; Molecular biology; Antibody; CD38; Immunology; Measles virus; B cell; CD19; Bone marrow; Biology; Immunoglobulin heavy chain,antibody secreting cells; bone marrow; heterogeneity; human; long-lived plasma cells; measles; mumps infection; next generation sequencing; plasma cells; plasmablasts; proteomics; vaccine,"ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1/metabolism; Adult; Aged; Antibodies, Viral/blood; Antigens, CD19/metabolism; Bone Marrow Cells/immunology; Humans; Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains/genetics; Measles virus/immunology; Membrane Glycoproteins/metabolism; Middle Aged; Mumps virus/immunology; Plasma Cells/immunology; RNA, Messenger/genetics; Syndecan-1/metabolism; Young Adult","Antibodies, Viral; Antigens, CD19; Immunoglobulin Heavy Chains; Membrane Glycoproteins; RNA, Messenger; SDC1 protein, human; Syndecan-1; CD38 protein, human; ADP-ribosyl Cyclase 1",NIAID NIH HHS (R21 AI109601) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U19 AI109962) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01AI045969) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R21AI109601) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U19 AI056390) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (K23 AI67501) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (N01-AI50029) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R01 AI097357) United States; PHS HHS (P01A1078907) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (P01 AI078907) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R21 AI094218) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U19 AI110483) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01 AI082196) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (L30 AI057621) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (N01AI50029) United States; NIH HHS (P51 OD011092) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R01 AI049660) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R37AI049660) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R37 AI049660) United States; NCRR NIH HHS (P51 RR000163) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (N01 AI50029) United States; NCI NIH HHS (P30 CA013148) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (AI049600) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (AI078907) United States; NIH HHS (8P51OD011092-53) United States; NCATS NIH HHS (UL1 TR000454) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (U01 AI045969) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (R21AI094218) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (K23 AI067501) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (ARRA:AI056390-06S2) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (UO1AI082196) United States; NIAID NIH HHS (HHSN266200500030C) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1074761315002605 https://www.umassmed.edu/globalassets/immunology-and-microbiology/documents/bbs822-2015-fall-pdfs/immunity-2015-halliley-longlived-hu-pc.pdf https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26187412/ https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/long-lived-plasma-cells-are-contained-within-the-cd19sup-supcd38s-2 https://www.cell.com/immunity/abstract/S1074-7613(15)00260-5 https://core.ac.uk/display/82156527 https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:rqt8s/ https://www.cell.com/immunity/pdf/S1074-7613(15)00260-5.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26187412 https://pesquisa.bvsalud.org/enfermeria/resource/es/mdl-26187412 https://www.cell.com/immunity/fulltext/S1074-7613(15)00260-5 https://ohsu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/long-lived-plasma-cells-are-contained-within-the-cd19-cd38hicd138 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82156527.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.immuni.2015.06.016,26187412,10.1016/j.immuni.2015.06.016,1550723234,PMC4680845,1,000-951-740-560-243; 001-351-568-846-457; 002-470-513-102-15X; 003-197-157-825-221; 006-558-834-519-011; 007-303-647-874-247; 007-871-444-766-954; 008-321-679-758-473; 008-883-197-323-295; 009-919-834-355-504; 010-342-021-874-640; 011-727-582-797-706; 013-318-462-994-559; 013-734-170-055-544; 020-796-283-720-907; 021-706-481-248-409; 022-496-932-592-799; 024-440-694-641-873; 031-199-968-826-29X; 032-209-923-947-066; 040-067-167-782-970; 040-517-716-324-362; 040-575-600-910-250; 041-609-867-808-57X; 045-569-392-358-203; 046-892-745-124-776; 047-920-145-687-307; 050-540-337-845-158; 055-517-209-964-140; 057-465-798-910-976; 058-006-157-947-801; 059-221-514-316-206; 068-283-870-472-950; 068-515-114-359-936; 074-966-156-398-343; 075-908-783-561-622; 076-806-662-161-402; 077-729-995-148-265; 080-565-013-319-679; 086-293-165-546-450; 086-868-479-626-239; 090-631-603-351-471; 095-564-640-205-726; 100-846-577-861-513; 117-713-624-893-63X; 122-563-663-442-794; 127-928-638-954-852; 133-004-777-099-443; 137-400-759-743-215; 140-019-966-773-535; 156-721-703-729-699; 171-613-250-877-087,210

To date, several behavioral and neuroimaging findings support the notion of a generalized magnitude system, although contradictory results showing a partial overlap or separate magnitude systems are also found. The possible existence of a generalized magnitude processing area leads to the question how individuals with developmental dyscalculia (DD), known for deficits in numerical-arithmetical abilities, process magnitudes. By means of neuropsychological tests and functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) we aimed to examine the relationship between number and space in typical and atypical development. Participants were 16 adolescents with DD (14.1 years) and 14 typically developing (TD) peers (13.8 years). In the fMRI paradigm participants had to perform discrete (arrays of dots) and continuous magnitude (angles) comparisons as well as a mental rotation task. In the neuropsychological tests, adolescents with dyscalculia performed significantly worse in numerical and complex visuo-spatial tasks. However, they showed similar results to TD peers when making discrete and continuous magnitude decisions during the neuropsychological tests and the fMRI paradigm. A conjunction analysis of the fMRI data revealed commonly activated higher order visual (inferior and middle occipital gyrus) and parietal (inferior and superior parietal lobe) magnitude areas for the discrete and continuous magnitude tasks. Moreover, no differences were found when contrasting both magnitude processing conditions, favoring the possibility of a generalized magnitude system. Group comparisons further revealed that dyscalculic subjects showed increased activation in domain general regions, whilst TD peers activate domain specific areas to a greater extent. In conclusion, our results point to the existence of a generalized magnitude system in the occipito-parietal stream in typical development. The detailed investigation of spatial and numerical magnitude abilities in DD reveals that the deficits in number processing and arithmetic cannot be explained with a general magnitude deficiency. Our results further indicate that multiple neuro-cognitive components might contribute to the explanation of DD.",11,,102,102,Developmental psychology; Neuropsychology; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Parietal lobe; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Dyscalculia; Developmental Dyscalculia; Magnitude (mathematics); Mental rotation,adolescents; developmental dyscalculia; functional magnetic resonance imaging; magnitude processing; numerosity; visuo-spatial processing,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00102/pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5357648 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00102/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357648 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00102/full https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/138250/ https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/138250/1/138250.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/82869436 http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/138250/1/138250.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00102,28373834,10.3389/fnhum.2017.00102,2595857152,PMC5357648,0,000-720-201-572-044; 000-788-992-136-767; 000-898-597-151-307; 001-766-771-132-059; 001-962-816-835-523; 003-726-761-941-73X; 004-030-636-268-081; 004-217-777-098-741; 005-427-625-373-902; 005-946-047-955-912; 007-321-973-695-040; 008-969-825-870-669; 009-340-421-889-441; 009-524-655-775-259; 010-841-783-547-175; 011-437-999-365-348; 011-766-789-020-517; 012-470-096-927-427; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-142-161-100-710; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-266-328-820-248; 016-414-556-554-895; 019-145-964-038-765; 019-426-786-871-500; 020-767-061-539-421; 021-671-283-817-095; 021-925-696-109-625; 024-311-244-236-511; 024-843-824-931-155; 025-950-638-432-192; 026-380-955-565-508; 026-801-611-514-937; 027-992-812-182-300; 029-417-942-990-754; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-502-843-043-112; 031-837-153-787-342; 033-810-369-397-207; 033-822-361-754-036; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-319-794-069-059; 036-529-996-325-426; 036-680-500-114-863; 040-202-412-212-939; 040-547-950-520-713; 040-900-334-917-973; 045-441-908-859-736; 046-401-607-330-206; 048-219-004-965-212; 048-889-201-158-674; 049-747-211-034-467; 049-756-869-432-079; 050-724-386-017-961; 051-301-074-196-640; 051-768-713-921-220; 052-556-423-157-22X; 054-832-618-960-232; 055-643-503-860-593; 056-219-379-641-257; 056-432-727-256-498; 057-115-550-640-095; 059-761-839-791-571; 060-645-206-905-070; 061-455-272-949-281; 061-502-622-588-324; 062-451-178-082-026; 062-738-367-496-162; 064-571-881-246-925; 066-608-905-207-154; 071-011-326-519-531; 071-879-952-650-138; 072-157-343-216-127; 074-787-419-311-34X; 075-549-085-444-419; 076-008-785-698-684; 077-801-593-495-321; 079-940-103-937-194; 082-356-402-138-590; 083-768-614-853-382; 084-603-329-828-314; 086-839-669-622-180; 088-702-417-633-364; 089-534-827-525-987; 091-359-688-746-603; 095-053-780-199-415; 100-875-691-519-87X; 101-450-667-767-630; 101-767-153-820-233; 102-755-968-592-356; 103-951-689-284-531; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-282-955-744-961; 112-631-434-776-909; 114-665-925-901-143; 116-953-283-915-381; 118-581-038-700-756; 121-648-864-891-066; 122-201-974-023-37X; 131-423-542-523-282; 132-102-071-896-363; 134-987-147-316-42X; 135-309-940-568-159; 137-337-133-011-216; 138-364-459-921-463; 144-747-377-111-26X; 146-518-280-455-588; 148-529-916-248-178; 153-174-100-314-196; 176-307-330-860-660,5

Teachers' justice, whether distributive or procedural, predicts teachers' legitimacy.; ; Aims; What is still do be found, and constitutes the goal of this paper, is whether unjust treatment by a teacher affects the legitimacy of the teacher differently when the student knows that the teacher was fair to a peer (comparative judgement) or when the student does not have that information (autonomous judgement).; ; Samples; A total of 79 high school students participated in Study 1; 75 high school students participated in Study 2.; ; Methods; Two experimental studies with a 2 justice valence (just, unjust) × 2 social comparison processes (autonomous judgements, comparative judgements) between-participants design were conducted. Study 1 addressed distributive justice and Study 2 addressed procedural justice. The dependent variable was teachers' legitimacy.; ; Results; In both studies, situations perceived as just led to higher teachers' legitimacy than situations perceived as unjust. For the distributive injustice conditions, teachers' legitimacy was equally lower for autonomous judgement and comparative judgement conditions. For procedural injustice, teachers' legitimacy was lower when the peer was treated justly and the participant was treated unfairly, compared with the condition when the participants did not know how the teacher treated the peer.; ; Conclusions; We conclude that teachers' injustice affects teachers' legitimacy, but it does it differently according to the social comparisons involved and the type of justice involved. Moreover, these results highlight that social comparisons are an important psychological process and, therefore, they should be taken into account in models of justice.",87,1,1,15,Peer group; Social influence; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Pedagogy; Judgement; Injustice; Procedural justice; Distributive justice; Legitimacy; Social psychology,adolescence; justice; legitimation of authority; social comparison; teachers' legitimacy,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Peer Group; School Teachers/psychology; Social Justice/psychology; Social Perception; Students/psychology,,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743388 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5855776 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12131 https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/25465/1/ICS_JVala_Teachers_ARI.pdf http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/25465 https://core.ac.uk/display/70656393 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1128885 https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12131 https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/publications/teachers-legitimacy-effects-of-justice-perception-and-social-comparison-processes/30507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12131,27743388,10.1111/bjep.12131,2530063838,,0,000-793-522-021-320; 001-143-194-765-292; 004-258-141-622-035; 005-495-093-612-996; 005-749-412-532-166; 006-168-557-774-087; 006-351-367-205-583; 007-349-845-017-637; 008-368-152-891-401; 009-551-798-170-04X; 011-645-336-376-667; 012-253-763-505-500; 013-201-303-507-62X; 017-422-857-884-157; 017-517-491-290-822; 018-345-367-783-679; 019-067-922-399-510; 019-303-532-604-20X; 021-202-166-519-193; 022-410-613-342-653; 024-416-992-972-670; 024-850-329-245-487; 026-984-194-598-512; 028-885-818-303-882; 033-128-703-756-585; 034-520-222-312-601; 044-631-342-934-063; 046-060-368-161-907; 047-631-509-012-976; 048-982-260-032-314; 049-782-249-125-237; 050-233-705-923-00X; 055-286-802-666-413; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-262-231-756-713; 056-818-612-584-40X; 061-379-690-842-370; 063-748-507-673-219; 063-884-128-799-395; 069-461-689-880-613; 080-432-271-897-595; 082-352-175-716-849; 084-533-544-849-66X; 086-352-532-245-092; 094-547-037-831-06X; 104-609-012-649-220; 105-902-036-518-531; 110-190-366-395-317; 113-458-224-648-431; 113-863-321-246-45X; 115-496-105-545-923; 116-891-442-169-072; 122-285-331-503-303; 139-665-368-466-165; 141-156-952-462-602; 143-931-965-777-838; 145-580-394-010-991; 148-147-612-350-364; 151-988-446-443-26X; 152-956-494-176-469; 156-732-183-617-506; 159-465-812-137-384; 164-525-151-718-693; 164-548-615-185-955; 176-528-745-666-885; 179-286-899-946-791; 194-036-893-402-904,4

Metaphor Theory (MT) predicts an asymmetric relationship between space and time. By contrast, A Theory of Magnitude (ATOM) does not predict any cross-dimensional asymmetry, since according to ATOM spatial and temporal extents are represented by a common neural metric for analog magnitude. To date, experiments designed to contrast these theories support MT over ATOM, in adults and children. Yet, proponents of ATOM have questioned whether some of the observed cross-dimensional asymmetries could be task-related artifacts. Here we conducted a test of the asymmetric relationship between space and time in children's minds, equating the perceptual availability of spatial and temporal information in the stimuli more stringently than in previous experiments in children. Results showed the space-time asymmetry predicted by MT. For the same stimuli (i.e., snails racing along parallel paths), spatial information influenced temporal judgments more than temporal information influenced spatial judgments. These results corroborate previous findings in Greek children and extend them to children who speak Dutch and Brazilian Portuguese. The space-time asymmetry in children's judgments is not due to task-related differences in the perceptual availability of spatial and temporal information in the stimuli; rather, it appears to be a consequence of how spatial and temporal representations are associated in the child's mind.",4,,803,803,Spacetime; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Spatial analysis; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Conceptual metaphor; Metaphor; Asymmetry; Magnitude (mathematics); Social psychology,ATOM; children; conceptual metaphor; space; time,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3817359/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00803/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00803/full http://core.ac.uk/display/26188999 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24204352/ https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC3817359 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82862220.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00803,24204352,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00803,2018124591,PMC3817359,0,001-244-253-407-376; 011-637-143-375-49X; 015-528-838-672-215; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-817-974-966-653; 017-531-593-130-097; 018-255-181-568-760; 022-085-582-945-331; 022-940-546-349-633; 023-747-133-742-412; 035-143-942-540-296; 036-018-967-090-600; 037-303-728-421-379; 038-302-264-776-746; 041-323-502-321-36X; 042-259-628-295-016; 049-118-976-478-199; 055-643-503-860-593; 060-290-302-293-721; 061-536-706-188-606; 063-249-751-915-957; 071-274-642-268-839; 073-281-538-767-951; 074-017-562-218-104; 083-665-507-689-714; 088-224-814-828-823; 094-426-560-466-422; 104-898-249-163-45X; 111-925-065-896-485; 116-681-363-443-795; 116-953-283-915-381; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-849-139-247-467; 122-201-974-023-37X; 129-032-914-840-116; 142-314-117-704-425; 155-590-493-745-223; 195-772-152-326-950,32

Since then, the measurement of attitude has become pervasive in education and other social sciences. It is used in particular for the assessment and evaluation of affect, and in particular attitudes to some construct or entity. Thurstone used two stages to measure attitudes: in the first he constructed a scale and operationalised a variable; in the second he used the scale to measure attitudes. To construct the scale, he required judges to compare statements for their intensity with respect to some construct and then used his law of comparative judgment to analyse the judgments in order to locate the statements on a continuum. This operationalised the variable. To measure the attitude, a person simply agreed or disagreed with the statements and the mean or median of the scale of values of the statements agreed to was taken as the attitude measure.",,,409,424,Likert scale; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Law of comparative judgment; Latent trait; Capital punishment; Two stages; Social psychology,,,,,https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/measuring-attitudes-by-unfolding-a-likertstyle-questionnaire(ff724650-67cd-4ed0-acec-3f3c9996b9de).html https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3368-7_29 https://research-repository.uwa.edu.au/en/publications/measuring-attitudes-by-unfolding-a-likert-style-questionnaire https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-94-017-3368-7_29,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-94-017-3368-7_29,,10.1007/978-94-017-3368-7_29,1021560018,,0,000-806-161-471-683; 003-973-861-388-415; 004-078-326-300-325; 005-576-210-633-361; 009-655-106-159-162; 011-765-770-143-344; 022-134-763-599-43X; 023-439-304-706-789; 030-637-613-202-147; 033-465-116-445-624; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-223-922-198-880; 041-026-944-010-883; 047-296-252-224-934; 047-410-827-372-679; 052-200-513-580-745; 058-357-262-233-370; 065-224-480-462-053; 069-835-964-958-029; 073-744-265-026-979; 084-163-580-228-777; 090-031-408-689-419; 101-854-571-095-949; 119-063-668-084-122; 128-171-105-352-458; 144-415-811-112-900; 149-069-726-285-770; 163-142-488-595-049; 164-690-721-925-619; 165-224-228-948-604; 165-440-725-703-647; 172-572-166-912-802,3

The random entities are selectively influenced by the corresponding factors if and only if the following condition, called the joint distribution criterion, is satisfied : there is a jointly distributed set of random entities, one entity for every value of every factor, such that every subset of this set that corresponds to a treatment is distributed as the original variables at this treatment. The distance tests (necessary conditions) for selective influence previously formulated for two random variables in a two-by-two factorial design (Kujala & Dzhafarov, 2008, J. Math.

Numeric and alphabetic serial order memories were contrasted. Three aspects of serial order memory processes were identified: computational complexity, directionality, and accessibility. Computational complexity is the number of algorithmic steps involved in identifying a target. Directional bias is measured as the speed differences in identifying serial targets of equal computational complexity in a stimulus array. Memory accessibility is measured as the numeric and alphabetic serial position effects. Subjects had a slight directional bias favoring backward ordering for single digits but no bias in 2-digit number ordering, in contrast to a strong forward directional advantage in letter ordering. The speed of number access was found to steadily and evenly decrease along the numeric scale, in contrast to a systematic pattern of variations in alphabet access along the alphabetic scale. Finally, the middle item effect (the middle item in a multi-item array is identified most slowly) found in Jou's (1997) multiple-letter comparison study was generalized to numbers.",116,4,543,579,Alphabet; Serial position effect; Psychology; Computational complexity theory; Cognitive science; Directionality; Directional bias; Comparison study; Arithmetic,,Adult; Cognition; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Linguistics; Male; Mathematics; Memory; Task Performance and Analysis,,PHS HHS (516335) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14723244,http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1423660,14723244,10.2307/1423660,2330272045,,0,,19

For a particular workpiece material, to select the appropriate tool material is an important prerequisite to increase the machining productivity and to improve the machined surface quality.In this paper, a weighting method of subjective judgment was utilized to conduct criteria weighting in the tool materials selection when machining Al-Si piston alloy. The analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method was used to subjectively judge the significance of the material properties and determine their criteria weight. The hierarchical structure model, with the objective layer, the criterion layer, and the alternative layer, was established. The performance of tool materials was set as the objective layer. Seven property indexes, such as density, Young's modulus, hardness, fracture toughness, thermal stability, thermal conductivity, thermal expansion coefficient, were chosen as the criterion layer in comparative judgment of the alternatives and criteria. And five kinds of tool materials, YG6X Cemented carbide, YG8 Cemented carbide, PCD, CBN, and Ceramic were chosen as the alternative layer. Then the pairwise comparison matrix of the material property index was constructed to compare a set of criteria pairwise according to their relative importance weight. The comparative weights were derived by finding the largest eigenvector with respective of the matrix. Finally, the consistency index and consistency ratio were calculated to ensure the consistency of the subjective perception and the accuracy of comparative weights. Then the weights of the material properties were determined, and the synthesis scores of the different tool material candidates were obtained.Results revealed that PCD was found as best materials for Al-Si piston alloy machining, and YG8 is slightly more suitable than YG6X for machining Al-Si piston alloy. In short, the qualitative problems in tool material selection were realized systematically and hierarchically by quantitatively calculation and analysis. This provides a new thinking in tool materials selection for high efficiency machining of difficult-to-machine materials.",836-837,,277,282,Weighting; Pairwise comparison; Materials science; Cemented carbide; Cutting tool; Material properties; Piston; Machining; Structural engineering; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.scientific.net/MSF.836-837.277,http://dx.doi.org/10.4028/www.scientific.net/msf.836-837.277,,10.4028/www.scientific.net/msf.836-837.277,2285314729,,0,,1

Results based on the full sample indicate that observed frequencies strongly conform to Benford’s Law (and thus suggest a high degree of accuracy of the figures reported in NPOs’ financial statements). Nevertheless, I note statistically significant deviations from Benford’s Law (both for the entire distribution and at the individual digit level). The largest deviation is noted for zeroes in the second position (i.e., a significantly positive deviation), which can be explained based on humans’ reliance upon so-called cognitive reference points.

Studies on the emergence and development of the SNARC effect remain scarce. The current study introduces an innovative new paradigm based on a simple color judgment of Arabic digits. Using this task, we found a SNARC effect in children as young as 5.5 years. In contrast, when preschool children needed to perform a magnitude judgment task necessitating exact number knowledge, the SNARC effect started to emerge only at 5.8 years. Moreover, the emergence of a magnitude SNARC but not a color SNARC was linked to proficiency with Arabic digits. Our results suggest that access to a spatially oriented approximate magnitude representation from symbolic digits emerges early in ontogenetic development. Exact magnitude judgments, on the other hand, rely on experience with Arabic digits and, thus, necessitate formal or informal schooling to give access to a spatially oriented numerical representation.",116,4,775,791,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Numeral system; Color discrimination; Numerical cognition; Binary classification; Arabic numerals; Correlation and dependence,Development; Magnitude representation; Number–space associations; Numerical cognition; SNARC; Symbolic numbers,"Child, Preschool; Color Perception; Concept Formation; Discrimination, Psychological; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematics; Size Perception; Space Perception",,,https://publications.uni.lu/handle/10993/6687 https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/6687/1/HoffmannHornungMartinSchiltz_2013.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513001483 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24055929 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1512841 https://psycnet.apa.org/index.cfm?fa=search.displayRecord&uid=2013-36347-002 https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/13025 https://core.ac.uk/display/16700585 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096513001483 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82785861.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.013,24055929,10.1016/j.jecp.2013.07.013,1971309830,,0,000-490-713-895-241; 000-779-672-638-421; 001-659-197-787-013; 002-385-282-260-807; 002-953-676-947-858; 003-626-441-665-213; 004-030-636-268-081; 005-521-968-785-459; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-386-415-800-986; 006-548-790-016-05X; 007-298-314-952-143; 010-294-410-265-319; 011-741-296-253-442; 012-386-984-787-272; 014-369-391-073-360; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-414-556-554-895; 017-085-978-465-253; 018-169-036-496-712; 019-198-395-259-670; 029-743-790-537-953; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-219-176-520-888; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-869-715-499-155; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-261-774-790-739; 034-440-021-374-187; 036-180-399-402-578; 036-412-993-844-272; 037-256-617-621-627; 039-917-478-441-834; 041-744-175-231-513; 042-108-554-770-743; 042-171-115-695-675; 043-472-308-841-240; 044-786-461-439-846; 044-978-090-842-05X; 045-327-304-100-252; 046-441-322-055-227; 047-584-386-471-064; 048-072-183-050-822; 054-814-756-958-705; 057-349-983-849-38X; 060-551-132-182-852; 062-922-875-309-626; 064-535-670-863-140; 066-304-520-554-064; 067-036-764-376-645; 069-096-471-449-385; 070-055-325-715-184; 072-157-343-216-127; 078-447-746-872-878; 078-579-203-510-090; 079-984-297-397-353; 084-421-364-199-245; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 092-272-102-076-652; 092-875-093-312-432; 105-942-707-129-817; 109-356-419-856-140; 118-531-830-057-973; 119-605-998-908-511; 120-204-913-104-353; 120-791-951-129-93X; 122-195-468-484-095; 123-432-042-579-428; 125-937-596-296-91X; 139-708-795-933-36X; 140-481-674-565-670; 140-596-764-632-267; 142-391-841-278-93X; 162-886-794-526-688; 194-903-265-762-557,80

However, in a context of comparative judgment, Arabic numbers are mapped onto space differently from sizes and heights: SNARC for Arabic digits is formed consistently in a certain cultural reading direction, whereas SNARC for sizes and heights is additionally modulated by comparative instruction (it reverses when participants choose larger magnitudes). In the present study, we test whether the spatial characteristic of magnitude processing revealed in a context of comparison is determined by a presence or lack of numerical content of the processed information, or it depends on specific directional experience (e.g., left-to-right ordering) associated with the processed magnitude format. We examine the SNARC effect with the pairwise comparison design, by using non-symbolic numerical stimuli (objects' collections), for which the left-to-right spatial structure is not as exceedingly overlearned as for Arabic numbers. We asked participants from two reading cultures (left-to-right vs. mixed reading culture) to compare numerosities of two sets, choosing either a larger or smaller one. SNARC emerged in both groups. Additionally, it was modulated by comparative instruction: It appeared in a left-to-right direction when participants selected a smaller set, but it tended to reverse when participants selected a larger set. We conclude that spatial processing of numerosities is dissociated from spatial processing of Arabic numbers, at least in a context of comparative judgment. This dissociation could reflect differences in spatial ordering experience specific to a certain numerical input.",17,2,127,137,Numerosity adaptation effect; Pairwise comparison; Speech recognition; Magnitude processing; Spatial ordering; Computer science; Magnitude (mathematics); Arabic numerals; Number line; Arithmetic; Correlation and dependence,Number line; Numerosity; SNARC; Spatial representation,"Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Language; Male; Mathematics; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time/physiology; Space Perception/physiology; Time Factors; Young Adult",,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26714804 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cp/cp17.html#PatroS16 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-015-0745-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26714804 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-015-0745-2/fulltext.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10339-015-0745-2,26714804,10.1007/s10339-015-0745-2,2214157788,,0,000-490-713-895-241; 003-146-829-638-518; 003-469-272-049-180; 003-756-834-371-246; 004-128-300-356-024; 005-783-682-084-833; 005-857-247-826-598; 008-423-594-939-432; 011-021-940-448-844; 014-221-436-595-226; 015-715-023-202-849; 015-932-952-551-526; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-096-212-135-705; 019-460-367-909-34X; 020-720-404-905-270; 022-312-351-230-82X; 026-158-354-509-386; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-517-525-016-84X; 030-847-139-438-94X; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-440-021-374-187; 035-013-638-860-011; 035-933-244-514-345; 036-302-964-021-739; 036-403-728-589-122; 036-459-179-538-121; 036-902-805-781-254; 037-559-042-610-406; 038-395-026-012-885; 039-123-008-628-552; 039-569-462-353-364; 039-722-117-248-289; 040-933-205-728-747; 047-584-386-471-064; 048-072-183-050-822; 048-889-201-158-674; 049-603-036-032-209; 049-725-492-962-923; 051-472-129-782-759; 053-756-966-193-449; 054-400-360-557-796; 057-324-019-822-303; 057-349-983-849-38X; 060-551-132-182-852; 061-665-841-149-002; 064-938-778-968-688; 072-157-343-216-127; 074-268-500-538-942; 077-199-101-572-900; 077-200-173-939-850; 078-649-785-249-179; 080-840-385-447-616; 081-521-184-111-567; 086-411-343-736-391; 090-989-429-837-914; 091-814-028-345-11X; 096-167-391-482-040; 096-974-841-889-042; 097-118-699-603-908; 099-136-579-277-759; 105-942-707-129-817; 120-204-913-104-353; 120-791-951-129-93X; 123-897-415-968-806; 128-887-777-838-374; 129-827-356-327-594; 140-481-674-565-670; 141-841-208-492-42X; 144-747-377-111-26X; 153-174-100-314-196; 162-886-794-526-688; 168-043-103-603-780; 178-568-837-098-490,6

When these internally generated perturbations are sufficiently large, the behaviour of the system is not solely driven by the external stimulus but also by its own spontaneous variability. Behavioural internal noise can be quantified, provided it is expressed in relative units of the noise source externally applied by the stimulus. In humans performing sensory tasks at near threshold performance, the size of internal noise is roughly equivalent to the size of the response fluctuations induced by the external noise source. It is not known how the human estimate compares with other animals, because behavioural internal noise has never been measured in other species. We have adapted the methodology used with humans to the zebrafish, a small teleost that displays robust visually-guided behaviour. Our measurements demonstrate that, under some conditions, it is possible to obtain viable estimates of internal noise in this vertebrate species; the estimates generally fall within the human range, suggesting that the properties of internal noise may reflect general constraints on stimulus-response coupling that apply across animal systems with substantially different characteristics.",127,,104,114,Sensory threshold; Detection theory; Stimulus (physiology); Perturbation (astronomy); Visual perception; Instrumental and intrinsic value; Biological system; Zebrafish; Computer science; Communication; Sensory system,Behavioural inconsistency; Fish cognition; Intraindividual variability; Shoaling; Signal detection theory,"Animals; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Models, Biological; Photic Stimulation/methods; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Signal Detection, Psychological/physiology; Visual Perception/physiology; Zebrafish/physiology",,Medical Research Council United Kingdom,https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/quantitative-assessment-of-intrinsic-noise-for-visually-guided-be http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/9125 http://audition.ens.fr/lsp/publis/bibtexbrowser.php?key=SpiliotiVargessonNeri2016&bib=publis_lsp.bib https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491704 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698916300773 http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/9125/1/VR_15_230R1_1_.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698916300773 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27491704 https://core.ac.uk/display/77051651 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/131024391.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2016.07.004,27491704,10.1016/j.visres.2016.07.004,2516456640,,0,000-780-747-391-063; 002-179-276-158-788; 003-962-445-879-262; 004-449-360-245-032; 008-146-405-737-506; 013-814-875-435-176; 014-817-682-912-220; 016-176-258-618-343; 017-489-521-345-447; 020-507-686-448-510; 026-733-584-540-424; 028-076-095-893-54X; 029-327-694-011-043; 029-866-300-055-936; 031-221-219-999-992; 034-569-883-239-701; 037-666-478-940-346; 041-004-018-893-341; 042-059-104-578-318; 042-063-017-985-750; 051-140-761-924-916; 057-801-820-507-711; 066-514-418-237-498; 078-841-805-417-53X; 081-417-707-561-357; 087-472-070-435-547; 089-776-381-537-079; 090-489-598-566-800; 098-218-528-135-892; 102-563-060-160-493; 110-739-854-294-027; 136-532-913-760-020; 199-055-961-488-187,1

Typically there are two core types discussed within the pertinent literature; criterion and norm referenced assessment. However another form, ipsative assessment, refers to the comparison between current and previous performance within a course of learning. This paper gives an overview of an ipsative approach to assessment that serves to facilitate an opportunity for students to develop personal constructs of capability and to provide a capacity to track competence based gains both normatively and ipsatively. The study cohort (n = 128) consisted of undergraduate students in a Design and Communication Graphics module of an Initial Technology Teacher Education programme. Four consecutive design assignments were designed to elicit core graphical skills and knowledge. An adaptive comparative judgment method was employed to rank responses to each assignment which were subsequently analysed from an ipsative perspective. The paper highlights the potential of this approach in developing students’ epistemological understanding of graphical and technological education. Significantly, this approach demonstrates the capacity of ACJ to track performance over time and explores this relative to student ability levels in the context of conceptual design.",29,4,701,715,Competence (human resources); Design education; Mathematics education; Psychology; Educational technology; Norm-referenced test; Educational assessment; Adaptive comparative judgement; Technology education; Ipsative,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1226416 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10798-018-9468-x.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1253264 https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/7281 https://paperity.org/p/163021850/integrating-learners-into-the-assessment-process-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x,,10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x,2895625638,,0,001-602-934-365-877; 001-617-068-953-753; 003-019-903-218-043; 004-050-431-221-43X; 007-702-163-095-94X; 009-631-573-859-890; 010-842-784-742-516; 012-266-132-871-064; 014-241-046-842-349; 015-817-184-183-607; 018-038-526-594-681; 019-287-416-093-054; 022-733-495-955-948; 026-054-301-619-278; 027-032-207-723-393; 030-197-391-074-111; 030-375-075-778-212; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-839-824-768-13X; 035-991-030-021-460; 036-351-305-383-067; 036-497-875-075-084; 043-128-207-906-620; 043-333-362-919-74X; 043-438-378-373-391; 044-774-292-104-86X; 048-091-210-665-560; 050-280-479-496-83X; 051-913-507-216-545; 055-247-734-603-784; 066-456-556-577-391; 072-849-297-804-522; 083-934-915-116-715; 089-236-550-620-512; 093-534-400-662-274; 102-955-514-174-383; 105-060-972-080-52X; 107-096-746-639-636; 113-184-615-486-147; 120-836-425-113-053; 123-212-204-814-685; 126-686-530-645-374; 130-572-675-668-023; 131-341-345-187-68X; 138-111-878-359-49X; 140-317-325-310-325; 149-208-961-050-864; 163-921-650-292-293; 163-938-197-264-411; 165-468-169-541-10X; 165-708-633-922-222; 168-704-895-296-891,3

To determine if spatial structure was observable at detection threshold contrasts, we simultaneously measured contrast detection and orientation–identification thresholds of flickering gratings. We then measured the apparent size of flickering grating bars at sub-threshold to supra-threshold contrast levels using two matching criteria: (1) by adjusting the spatial frequency of a stationary comparison grating and (2) by adjusting the distance between two parallel thin lines. For all subjects, contrast detection and orientation–identification thresholds were similar, indicating that sufficient spatial structure is observable at detection threshold to make judgements of local spatially defined features. With increasing flicker rate, the apparent periodicity of low (0.25 and 0.50 cpd) spatial frequency test gratings increased. At detection threshold contrast levels and below, all observers reported difficulty in performing the match and results were variable. Size matches using stationary gratings were consistently smaller than those made using the line targets, which is suggestive of distortion in perceived spatial structure at the nodal region of flickering gratings.",47,13,1732,1744,Spatial frequency; Sensory threshold; Distortion; Optics; Flicker; Frequency-doubling illusion; Grating; Apparent Size; Poison control,,"Adult; Contrast Sensitivity; Form Perception; Humans; Illusions; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds; Time Factors",,,http://pubmed.cn/17481693 https://core.ac.uk/display/81104937 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Metha/publication/6349094_Spatial_structure_of_the_frequency_doubling_illusion/links/0c960528daad31f8d1000000.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698907001034 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/297367-spatial-structure-of-the-frequency-doubling-illusion http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481693 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81104937.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2007.03.013,17481693,10.1016/j.visres.2007.03.013,1985542009,,0,002-362-677-281-82X; 003-854-939-793-153; 004-171-362-609-772; 005-001-376-168-992; 006-182-921-845-082; 009-863-224-755-121; 010-225-321-126-756; 011-904-904-143-698; 011-968-098-818-744; 012-717-610-873-743; 017-829-990-035-538; 019-715-295-889-344; 027-372-503-647-306; 030-957-394-406-942; 033-545-480-454-439; 034-685-070-423-091; 036-330-287-394-324; 038-727-677-768-465; 040-836-628-884-405; 053-893-560-716-650; 056-353-221-414-377; 060-537-911-465-893; 065-542-676-261-089; 076-000-066-055-571; 080-058-521-909-804; 098-925-152-069-980; 099-850-902-437-555; 107-758-455-605-33X; 113-887-021-044-422; 141-191-472-432-002; 142-793-174-042-588; 185-200-260-254-046; 188-178-083-685-072,6

Moore; Deborah A. Small,"People believe that they are better than others on easy tasks and worse than others on difficult tasks. In previous attempts to explain these better-than-average and worse-than-average effects, researchers have invoked bias and motivation as causes. In this article, the authors develop a more parsimonious account, the differential information explanation, in which it is assumed only that people typically have better information about themselves than they do about others. When one's own performance is exceptional (either good or bad), it is often reasonable to assume others' will be less so. Consequently, people estimate the performance of others as less extreme (more regressive) than their own. The result is that people believe they are above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult tasks. These effects are exacerbated when people have accurate information about their performances, increasing the natural discrepancy between knowledge of the self and knowledge of others. The effects are attenuated when people obtain accurate information about the performances of others.",92,6,972,989,Social perception; Psychology; Egocentrism; Cognition; Self; Social comparison theory; Cognitive bias; Overconfidence effect; Social psychology; Social cognition,,Adult; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Self Concept; Social Identification,,Carnegie Mellon University; National Science Foundation,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.972 http://learnmoore.org/mooredata/MIO/Moore&Small.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17547483 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2007-07951-002 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/17547483,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.972,17547483,10.1037/0022-3514.92.6.972,3121663241,,0,003-823-085-804-979; 004-459-184-623-821; 004-688-760-041-053; 005-105-404-496-456; 005-780-876-195-626; 007-082-882-552-460; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-723-463-031-98X; 012-124-178-548-103; 012-419-306-168-454; 016-509-402-794-767; 018-532-140-455-519; 019-415-581-803-244; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-021-272-761-642; 023-639-356-479-473; 025-498-944-344-037; 029-091-639-120-134; 029-323-708-071-509; 029-919-569-926-69X; 030-123-718-813-763; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-534-314-680-166; 036-962-225-909-922; 037-810-104-051-02X; 040-261-830-869-773; 041-499-335-862-394; 044-221-822-340-940; 044-765-092-858-566; 049-156-922-816-938; 049-325-626-588-234; 054-938-373-448-403; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-979-804-290-796; 058-279-646-676-866; 061-142-370-003-855; 064-990-488-097-173; 065-351-381-849-959; 065-796-557-496-125; 066-922-859-214-884; 073-663-750-011-207; 077-534-894-375-688; 079-463-629-173-564; 079-620-280-853-749; 081-476-781-835-336; 082-662-120-833-072; 086-373-927-285-964; 090-589-468-914-713; 093-984-078-512-830; 094-133-760-710-451; 096-792-630-788-615; 098-052-936-614-844; 102-795-542-679-792; 104-155-878-524-214; 105-583-418-831-173; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 110-433-702-594-897; 110-460-562-767-55X; 110-637-461-773-230; 111-252-831-147-296; 111-659-884-856-63X; 113-047-964-327-688; 114-590-207-496-477; 115-707-214-392-660; 116-762-136-028-844; 116-981-239-774-225; 119-897-887-862-263; 120-941-958-292-714; 123-711-683-498-099; 124-002-183-259-416; 124-656-535-257-223; 142-392-033-523-68X; 157-275-055-135-727; 159-661-019-414-284; 160-652-532-329-575; 165-707-840-836-402; 180-613-410-178-805,197

Clark; Kate L. Howard; Andy T. Woods; Ian S. Penton-Voak; Christof Neumann,"We introduce ""EloChoice"", a package for R which uses Elo rating to assess pairwise comparisons between stimuli in order to measure perceived stimulus characteristics. To demonstrate the package and compare results from forced choice pairwise comparisons to those from more standard single stimulus rating tasks using Likert (or Likert-type) items, we investigated perceptions of physical strength from images of male bodies. The stimulus set comprised images of 82 men standing on a raised platform with minimal clothing. Strength-related anthropometrics and grip strength measurements were available for each man in the set. UK laboratory participants (Study 1) and US online participants (Study 2) viewed all images in both a Likert rating task, to collect mean Likert scores, and a pairwise comparison task, to calculate Elo, mean Elo (mElo), and Bradley-Terry scores. Within both studies, Likert, Elo and Bradley-Terry scores were closely correlated to mElo scores (all rs > 0.95), and all measures were correlated with stimulus grip strength (all rs > 0.38) and body size (all rs > 0.59). However, mElo scores were less variable than Elo scores and were hundreds of times quicker to compute than Bradley-Terry scores. Responses in pairwise comparison trials were 2/3 quicker than in Likert tasks, indicating that participants found pairwise comparisons to be easier. In addition, mElo scores generated from a data set with half the participants randomly excluded produced very comparable results to those produced with Likert scores from the full participant set, indicating that researchers require fewer participants when using pairwise comparisons.",13,1,e0190393,,Two-alternative forced choice; Likert scale; Statistics; Physical strength; Psychology; Pairwise comparison; Hand strength; Grip strength; Body size; Anthropometry,,Adolescent; Clothing; Hand Strength; Humans; Male; Muscle Strength; Perception; Probability; Young Adult,,Leverhulme Trust (GB),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29293615 https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/143485153/Full_text_PDF_final_published_version_.pdf https://paperity.org/p/85599508/why-rate-when-you-could-compare-using-the-elochoice-package-to-assess-pairwise http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PLoSO..1390393C/abstract https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/15699 https://core.ac.uk/display/146503624 https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/15699/1/Fulltext.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0190393,29293615,10.1371/journal.pone.0190393,2782290562,PMC5749798,0,000-939-259-703-381; 008-603-721-969-887; 016-135-876-732-740; 017-958-831-518-218; 018-269-445-638-29X; 024-030-345-097-177; 026-506-897-501-75X; 026-966-848-028-588; 031-077-669-014-667; 031-830-169-787-740; 034-019-249-919-252; 035-316-542-105-300; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-324-638-527-935; 041-656-251-943-572; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-636-261-112-498; 047-194-700-536-708; 048-707-949-370-675; 054-686-623-173-45X; 062-487-702-306-626; 065-913-003-281-798; 081-188-945-726-202; 083-422-757-209-123; 087-991-691-200-809; 091-227-781-521-535; 113-079-030-498-041; 114-709-993-643-205; 126-892-691-029-991; 134-209-258-360-246; 136-606-604-022-63X; 136-608-470-526-603; 144-396-410-698-84X; 149-392-700-656-713; 154-354-210-030-500; 155-216-662-253-036; 156-131-455-686-350; 199-652-686-708-020,10

Neurocognitive research is redefining mathematical proficiency and student agency in terms of the activation of “neuronal populations”. We show how this research deploys a particular image of number that stresses cardinality rather than ordinality. An emphasis on cardinality effectively reduces the time-value of students’ cognitive labour, produces new kinds of dis/abled bodies, and recruits new kinds of value from those bodies. We discuss current research on dyscalculia in mathematics education, and situate this work in relation to literature in critical dis/ability studies and inclusive materialism. We suggest that the concept of ‘student alienation’ must be radically reconfigured in contemporary contexts in order to address the biopolitics of current education research. Our aim is to direct attention to the need for new kinds of neurocognitive research, not to reject it altogether.",79,,222,230,Materialism; Psychology; Cognition; Alienation; Neurocognitive; Number sense; Cognitive psychology; Dyscalculia; Cardinality; Social psychology; Biopower,,,,,http://e-space.mmu.ac.uk/617987/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82343917 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035515300963 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035515300963 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82343917.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2015.10.008,,10.1016/j.ijer.2015.10.008,2217158753,,0,000-391-273-375-862; 000-606-084-961-331; 001-542-945-654-883; 004-907-340-418-317; 005-923-715-132-646; 022-987-429-176-671; 023-674-851-373-274; 024-380-269-513-828; 024-433-711-947-386; 026-195-186-418-137; 027-287-033-174-121; 028-937-002-511-066; 031-191-749-173-51X; 034-514-307-758-767; 038-930-130-632-672; 040-458-085-919-302; 045-416-553-172-905; 045-763-785-285-083; 048-468-100-756-768; 048-912-981-116-047; 049-747-211-034-467; 054-622-613-921-618; 064-261-759-533-652; 064-672-833-839-016; 068-865-428-808-888; 070-584-032-613-559; 082-538-954-846-963; 084-787-803-411-495; 087-751-931-392-852; 090-803-905-303-924; 091-125-118-048-107; 103-027-865-836-89X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 121-648-864-891-066; 129-827-356-327-594; 152-762-248-756-93X; 152-851-921-965-411; 156-471-624-715-855; 158-615-263-210-829; 183-808-381-211-512; 189-871-566-119-624; 196-185-923-782-787,18

Raath; D. Norman; I. McGregor; Richard Dashwood; Darren J. Hughes,"Press-hardened boron steel has been utilized in anti-intrusion systems in automobiles, providing high strength and weight-saving potential through gage reduction. Boron steel spot welds exhibit a soft heat-affected zone which is surrounded by a hard nugget and outlying base material. This soft zone reduces the strength of the weld and makes it susceptible to failure. Additionally, different welding regimes lead to significantly different hardness distributions, making failure prediction difficult. Boron steel sheets, welded with fixed and adaptive schedules, were characterized. These are the first experimentally determined residual stress distributions for boron steel resistance spot welds which have been reported. Residual strains were measured using neutron diffraction, and the hardness distributions were measured on the same welds. Additionally, similar measurements were performed on spot welded DP600 steel as a reference material. A correspondence between residual stress and hardness profiles was observed for all welds. A significant difference in material properties was observed between the fixed schedule and adaptively welded boron steel samples, which could potentially lead to a difference in failure loads between the two boron steel welds.",48,6,2900,2914,Spot welding; Residual; Metallurgy; Materials science; Welding; Significant difference; Material properties; Residual stress; Boron; Neutron diffraction,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/79553115/effect-of-weld-schedule-on-the-residual-stress-distribution-of-boron-steel-spot-welds http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MMTA...48.2900R/abstract https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-weld-schedule-on-the-residual-stress-distribution-of-bo https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11661-017-4079-9.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81920318 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/88030/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81920318.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9,,10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9,2597858579,,0,003-599-203-542-233; 006-580-663-504-034; 009-568-240-047-342; 009-962-146-867-913; 015-208-598-760-044; 019-966-643-516-971; 023-407-633-563-25X; 029-957-314-850-205; 040-701-666-895-641; 044-719-426-526-303; 047-773-796-991-743; 050-888-254-620-997; 056-975-423-369-419; 057-548-910-727-922; 062-575-562-329-067; 084-992-952-524-357; 090-006-510-330-889; 097-729-408-724-746; 102-792-696-415-657; 106-981-564-922-882; 107-120-627-880-31X; 111-428-782-725-219; 120-570-723-942-372; 124-373-969-562-241; 136-673-280-450-370; 142-263-466-225-361; 148-482-536-887-669; 148-817-624-193-466; 160-379-085-701-827; 161-001-730-168-650; 176-733-334-872-476; 182-570-153-714-376; 182-813-876-392-722; 184-671-405-260-071,2

The DSS makes use of a structured hierarchical approach featuring the multiplicative AHP also known as the REMBRANDT technique. The paper addresses the influence of the progression factor used when transforming the decision makers' verbal responses from a semantic to a geometric scale in REMBRANDT. Conventionally, the progression factor 2 is used for calculating scores of alternatives and √2 for calculation of criteria weights. Tests are conducted on the magnitude of these progression factors in order to examine the sensitivity towards the final outcome of an analysis. For illustration a case study concerning the appraisal of a large infrastructure project is presented. The results of the sensitivity calculations are compared with the results of a conventional AHP calculation in order to examine what impact the choice of progression factors as well as the choice of technique have on the decision making. Based on this a modified progression factor for the calculation of scores for the alternatives in REMBRANDT is suggested while the progression factor for the criteria weights is suggested to be kept unchanged. Finally, conclusions and perspectives are set out. </jats:p>",12,5,887,903,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/13779665.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s0219622013400014,,10.1142/s0219622013400014,,,0,001-174-662-522-948; 012-310-473-161-365; 023-651-357-330-39X; 037-204-759-242-433; 039-503-930-970-274; 039-891-507-969-628; 043-898-643-229-487; 047-321-877-806-477; 048-291-955-168-581; 051-766-406-502-406; 061-920-299-226-068; 068-237-352-276-493; 087-014-851-993-965; 087-495-611-495-270; 093-854-913-601-787; 116-141-262-372-636; 153-849-273-223-674; 166-459-052-775-211; 166-615-226-837-307; 168-086-321-592-776; 170-790-251-883-084; 173-486-540-927-509; 186-211-646-508-379,2

Recent findings show that even educated adults use their fingers as a visuo-motor support to process, represent, and communicate numerosities. Indeed, using fingers to represent numerosities prototypically has been shown to give the corresponding finger configurations a special status in long-term memory: these configurations are recognized and processed faster than other finger configurations, providing a direct access to number magnitude, what other finger configurations do less efficiently. This occurs for configurations stemming from finger counting (i.e., the way the fingers are raised to count for oneself; for example, thumb, index, and middle fingers for numerosity {3}) and from finger montring (i.e., the way fingers are raised to show numerosities to someone else; for example, index, middle, and ring fingers for numerosity {3}). However, finger numeral representation is not just another way of representing numerical magnitudes mentally. We argue that it also contributes to acquiring, building, and then accessing number semantics, and that, compared to other numerical representations, it provides an extra value by rooting number meaning in a culturally shared yet non-arbitrary and self-experienced sensory–motor representation.",2,,272,272,Semantics; Artificial intelligence; Numerosity adaptation effect; Natural number; Numeral system; Natural language processing; Finger-counting; Symbolic code; Computer science; Numerical cognition; Arithmetic,,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3208387 http://core.ac.uk/display/26898387 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00272/pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00272/full https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/16334 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3208387 http://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/16334 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00272/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82840923.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00272,22069392,10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00272,1977730110,PMC3208387,0,001-768-224-718-965; 005-033-390-148-10X; 011-024-140-736-26X; 013-682-969-036-852; 015-364-587-824-983; 019-078-823-003-334; 019-135-231-838-82X; 029-915-293-337-721; 033-843-519-722-206; 033-983-526-594-841; 035-774-170-805-004; 037-080-984-994-496; 040-747-243-197-079; 044-510-755-984-834; 052-423-186-297-165; 053-724-999-609-942; 062-020-170-198-29X; 066-956-340-187-096; 068-163-012-872-476; 075-144-124-858-484; 075-809-664-272-525; 086-604-548-762-471; 094-472-031-742-070; 095-796-641-958-116; 110-712-246-191-155; 125-197-285-595-145; 141-931-582-583-259; 144-747-377-111-26X; 153-174-100-314-196; 169-747-633-428-758,62

They are carried out so efficiently that they are often considered to be automatic and innate. However, numerosity of non-symbolic stimuli is highly correlated with its continuous properties (e.g., density, area), and so it is hard to determine whether numerosity and continuous properties rely on the same mechanism. Here we examined the behavioral and neuronal mechanisms underlying such judgments. We scanned subjects' hemodynamic responses to a numerosity comparison task and to a surface area comparison task. In these tasks, numerical and continuous magnitudes could be either congruent or incongruent. Behaviorally, an interaction between the order of the tasks and the relevant dimension modulated the congruency effects. Continuous magnitudes always interfered with numerosity comparison. Numerosity, on the other hand, interfered with the surface area comparison only when participants began with the numerosity task. Hemodynamic activity showed that context (induced by task order) determined the neuronal pathways in which the dimensions were processed. Starting with the numerosity task led to enhanced activity in the right hemisphere, while starting with the continuous task led to enhanced left hemisphere activity. Continuous magnitudes processing relied on activation of the frontal eye field and the post-central gyrus. Processing of numerosities, on the other hand, relied on deactivation of these areas, suggesting active suppression of the continuous dimension. Accordingly, we suggest that numerosities, even in the subitizing range, are not always processed automatically; their processing depends on context and task demands.",77,,137,147,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Visual perception; Cognitive psychology; Gyrus; Neuronal pathway; Numerical cognition; Subitizing; Lateralization of brain function,Congruity effect; Continuous magnitudes; Numerical cognition; Numerosity processing; Subitizing; fMRI,Brain/physiology; Cerebrovascular Circulation/physiology; Female; Hemodynamics/physiology; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Neural Pathways/physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult,,European Research Council; Seventh Framework Programme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393215301329 https://core.ac.uk/display/82007616 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393215301329 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26297625 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26297625 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82007616.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.08.016,26297625,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2015.08.016,1181626278,PMC4710636,0,000-391-273-375-862; 000-720-201-572-044; 000-774-598-960-961; 001-499-673-641-104; 002-743-317-587-306; 004-235-736-539-538; 005-708-717-917-584; 005-783-682-084-833; 007-277-389-709-508; 007-914-700-592-576; 008-573-173-860-893; 009-500-494-423-968; 010-841-783-547-175; 012-955-877-697-463; 013-254-779-044-236; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-443-656-078-669; 016-553-465-095-865; 017-279-491-992-84X; 019-198-395-259-670; 020-088-732-249-771; 023-290-232-151-661; 027-666-832-184-684; 032-635-789-049-979; 033-389-087-954-11X; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-402-974-768-248; 036-302-964-021-739; 037-080-984-994-496; 037-286-599-571-773; 038-395-026-012-885; 038-878-351-149-953; 039-348-010-332-950; 039-555-369-773-746; 041-313-540-432-061; 041-442-979-711-770; 049-092-751-377-693; 050-867-361-847-430; 052-356-812-890-744; 052-997-156-271-848; 056-170-806-678-309; 056-565-613-289-039; 057-349-983-849-38X; 057-877-558-474-926; 060-671-975-695-863; 060-748-407-187-900; 063-828-395-564-893; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-977-657-239-858; 074-927-200-217-174; 075-769-421-896-604; 076-756-295-842-560; 076-931-578-139-299; 079-276-930-986-288; 085-834-343-205-45X; 089-534-827-525-987; 091-781-741-854-616; 092-491-995-641-38X; 096-922-372-028-180; 097-933-480-117-519; 100-380-321-086-38X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-936-931-089-579; 111-874-350-285-168; 116-953-283-915-381; 120-204-913-104-353; 122-423-243-764-899; 129-243-614-857-75X; 129-827-356-327-594; 164-771-637-458-012,21

The basic problem is how the game should be evaluated: it has no expectation and hence no well-defined value. Easwaran (2008) has shown that the Pasadena game does have a weak expectation, raising the possibility that we can eliminate the value gap by requiring agents to value gambles at their weak expectations (where they exist). In this paper, I first prove a negative result: there are gambles like the Pasadena game that do not even have a weak expectation. Hence, problematic value gaps remain even if decision theory is extended to take in weak expectations. There is a further challenge: the existence of a ‘value gap’ in the Pasadena game seems to make decision theory inapplicable in a number of cases where the right choice is obvious. The positive contribution of the paper is a theory of ‘relative utilities’, an extension of decision theory that lets us make comparative judgements even among gambles that have no well-defined value.",125,499,799,827,Epistemology; Mathematical economics; Economics; Decision theory,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/BARMDW https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5649904 https://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/499/799.abstract https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/125/499/799/2563363,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzv152,,10.1093/mind/fzv152,2478576108,,0,003-215-574-891-955; 003-704-208-147-496; 004-253-147-368-282; 006-840-861-065-448; 010-020-267-730-645; 010-306-032-161-306; 016-764-603-940-212; 024-754-228-568-308; 027-151-445-156-912; 031-430-499-046-053; 047-862-315-771-85X; 062-508-677-263-897; 064-004-591-528-00X; 090-721-258-243-734; 100-092-259-619-002; 104-466-984-919-787; 105-688-345-312-903; 143-829-935-168-942; 148-408-593-620-682; 164-980-227-057-006; 177-162-865-921-863; 182-664-322-815-248; 193-515-011-759-787,7

Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Mark Lansdale; Joyce E. Humphries; Victoria Flynn,"Learning about object locations in space usually involves the summation of information from different experiences of that space and requires various cognitive operations to make this possible. These processes are poorly understood and, in the extreme, may not occur--leading to mutual exclusivity of memories (Baguley, Lansdale, Lines, & Parkin, 2006). In this article, we investigate how the precision of location memory--evident in near-miss errors in recall--is related to different transformational processes in spatial cognition. Analyzing errors and latencies in a sequential comparative judgment task, 4 experiments show that the precision with which location is represented in memory is specifically degraded by a subset of transformations in which an object location encoded in reference to 1 anchor point is recalibrated in relation to another. We discuss the general implications of this finding for spatial learning and demonstrate that, rather than being a special case, exclusivity in memory is the extreme expression of a rational trade-off between the benefit of combining spatial information from more than 1 memory and the reduced precision that follows from the transformations required.",39,5,1501,1519,Recall; Special case; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Spatial analysis; Cognition; Spatial cognition; Spatial ability; Spatial learning; Communication; Location,,Adolescent; Adult; Cues; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Mental Recall/physiology; Middle Aged; Space Perception/physiology; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://repository.edgehill.ac.uk/5299/ http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23506139 https://research.edgehill.ac.uk/en/publications/cognitive-operations-on-space-and-their-impact-on-the-precision-o-2 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1056055 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23506139,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0031838,23506139,10.1037/a0031838,2018801847,,0,001-750-841-529-849; 001-978-588-121-591; 002-685-000-074-462; 005-838-657-172-60X; 012-772-514-154-572; 016-446-602-744-646; 021-246-529-700-739; 025-817-030-541-54X; 026-624-033-943-320; 028-003-709-349-649; 029-801-209-884-357; 035-764-593-157-53X; 036-333-146-788-69X; 040-056-653-375-832; 041-545-813-066-195; 043-226-397-473-625; 045-790-137-422-098; 049-037-287-792-049; 054-472-182-870-394; 055-776-072-470-76X; 061-214-352-934-509; 064-453-794-707-044; 065-911-409-670-268; 074-044-174-074-392; 074-792-812-248-435; 079-740-991-926-736; 095-416-480-476-142; 100-736-237-855-523; 101-773-861-650-07X; 102-602-710-837-97X; 102-964-234-743-945; 105-985-186-375-94X; 109-923-896-991-511; 111-807-149-235-791; 114-165-466-927-158; 124-474-255-721-979; 135-061-523-793-615; 144-710-578-846-116; 151-911-967-475-042; 162-281-765-515-283; 169-789-233-844-678,2

The conventional wisdom is that such prescriptions are the province of nonideal theory but that ideal theory is required as a guide for nonideal theory. On this view, our first task is to specify fully just principles of regulation—that is, principles that regulate the constitution of fully just institutional arrangements. 1 These principles subsequently guide and constrain our attempts to prescribe institutional solutions to address actual injustices. 2 Call this the ideal guidance approach to institutional design.

In the human neuroimaging literature, two signatures of bi-dimensional cognitive maps have been reported: the grid-like code and the distance-dependent code. While these kinds of representation were previously observed during spatial navigation and, more recently, during processing of perceptual stimuli, it is still an open question whether they also underlie the representation of the most basic items of language: words. Here we taught human participants the meaning of novel words as arbitrary labels for a set of audiovisual objects varying orthogonally in size and sound. The novel words were therefore conceivable as points in a navigable 2D map of meaning. While subjects performed a word comparison task, we recorded their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By applying a combination of representational similarity and fMRI-adaptation analyses, we found evidence of (i) a grid-like code, in the right postero-medial entorhinal cortex, representing the relative angular positions of words in the word space, and (ii) a distance-dependent code, in medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and mid-cingulate cortices, representing the Euclidean distance between words. Additionally, we found evidence that the brain also separately represents the single dimensions of word meaning: their implied size, encoded in visual areas, and their implied sound, in Heschl's gyrus/Insula. These results support the idea that the meaning of words, when they are organized along two dimensions, is represented in the human brain across multiple maps of different dimensionality. Significant statement How do we represent the meaning of words and perform comparative judgements on them in our brain? According to influential theories, concepts are conceivable as points of an internal map (where distance represents similarity) that, as the physical space, can be mentally navigated. Here we use fMRI to show that when humans compare newly learnt words, they recruit a grid-like and a distance code, the same types of neural codes that, in mammals, represent relations between locations in the environment and support physical navigation between them.",232,,117876,,Insula; Euclidean distance; Brain activity and meditation; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Cognitive map; Natural language processing; Perception; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Computer science; Spatial memory,Distance code; Entorhinal cortex; Grid-like code; Navigation; Words; vmPFC,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811921001531,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,33636346,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,3130613096,,0,002-361-179-653-833; 003-028-967-630-066; 004-478-535-703-270; 006-613-053-767-871; 006-692-383-377-268; 007-132-867-143-709; 011-538-156-264-314; 013-165-492-805-03X; 013-213-970-419-250; 014-024-068-398-452; 014-210-555-069-030; 016-414-813-050-875; 021-736-694-082-286; 024-189-717-981-292; 031-293-580-765-647; 033-287-870-710-726; 033-442-984-511-466; 034-024-375-481-50X; 034-874-174-893-488; 036-735-214-067-934; 039-248-614-176-559; 040-543-839-617-519; 041-222-456-792-220; 041-294-666-539-760; 042-966-784-480-742; 043-890-715-351-494; 044-264-243-301-461; 049-940-851-911-477; 051-281-955-014-071; 054-630-926-268-365; 056-105-599-056-361; 056-576-148-142-317; 063-433-869-352-088; 065-077-486-249-213; 067-879-125-389-808; 068-910-911-949-197; 070-297-699-153-640; 073-008-629-758-949; 074-792-812-248-435; 076-045-489-927-422; 076-529-940-900-699; 082-244-347-583-942; 082-541-909-852-077; 092-923-598-568-103; 113-973-431-964-847; 116-599-876-467-271; 121-943-242-529-339; 132-577-677-705-698; 139-614-088-148-146; 154-068-214-565-994; 154-541-474-697-636; 160-414-603-840-810; 170-359-567-943-583,0

One important decision concerns the (odd) number of scale points (e.g., five, seven, nine, or eleven) that has to be assigned to either brands or products in each pair. Using data from an experiment with 122 students, we assessed the extent to which GPCs with a higher number of scale points (requiring more cognitive effort) really outperform GPCs with a smaller number of scale points (requiring less cognitive effort). Our data analyses have shown that one may reduce the (odd) number of scale points from eleven to nine or seven, depending on what minor compromises one is willing to make. The detailed psychometric results presented in this paper are useful to applied researchers as they help them in making well-informed decisions on the number of scale points in a GPC task.",47,5,2869,2882,Statistics; Market research; Cognitive effort; Preference measurement; Measurement validity; Mathematics; Rating scale,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/5814457 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/qualqt/v47y2013i5p2869-2882.html https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F116918 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11135-012-9695-2 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/61745/1/DeBeuckelaer_Toonen_Davidov_2012_QQ.pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/61745/ https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/116918 http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/61745/1/DeBeuckelaer_Toonen_Davidov_2012_QQ.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11135-012-9695-2,,10.1007/s11135-012-9695-2,2145053792,,0,003-699-996-472-041; 008-461-780-500-711; 009-878-793-526-726; 027-096-410-478-955; 035-232-217-361-572; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-651-613-238-321; 041-812-812-164-977; 047-512-150-108-530; 051-493-073-728-632; 052-449-756-097-284; 055-571-573-562-380; 055-705-539-009-486; 058-371-276-588-405; 066-443-922-001-067; 067-507-581-395-067; 072-414-985-242-559; 073-590-014-831-704; 075-303-556-951-08X; 076-194-923-064-105; 084-782-941-281-948; 089-224-935-641-850; 089-568-056-584-676; 098-331-165-329-78X; 101-507-230-545-562; 105-682-553-794-444; 106-507-761-304-954; 112-799-249-617-462; 115-539-251-820-732; 117-265-544-353-477; 122-780-528-453-563; 160-781-079-111-439; 177-401-024-703-20X; 184-163-882-210-658; 186-169-787-586-999; 189-115-221-653-799,6

The dataset has proven to be a challenging test for objective quality metrics. The dataset mean opinion scores were obtained by collecting pairwise comparison judgments using the Swiss tournament system, and averaging votes of observers. However, this approach differs from the usual analysis of multiple pairwise comparisons, which involves psychometric scaling of the comparison data using either Thurstone or Bradley-Terry models. In this paper we investigate how quality scores change when they are computed using such psychometric scaling instead of averaging vote counts. In order to properly scale TID2013 quality scores, we conduct four additional experiments of two different types, which we found necessary to produce a common quality scale: comparisons with reference images, and cross-content comparisons. We demonstrate on a fifth validation experiment that the two additional types of comparisons are necessary and in conjunction with psychometric scaling improve the consistency of quality scores, especially across images depicting different contents.",,,1,6,Statistics; Distortion; Tournament; Thurstone scale; Task analysis; Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Image quality; Data modeling; Scaling,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/qomex/qomex2018.html#MikhailiukPM18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/qomex.2018.8463376,,10.1109/qomex.2018.8463376,2892006951,,0,,6

Thompson; Joseph V. Baranski,"We examined whether responses to three comparative judgment tasks conformed to a general- or a task-specific model of decision making and confidence. We sought to determine if individual differences in confidence and decision making were evident for these tasks, and if cognitive styles accounted for these individual differences. Undergraduate students completed cognitive styles measures in a mass-testing session, and they performed the computer-administered comparative judgment tasks in later experimental sessions. Confirmatory factor analyses of the confidence and decision making indices revealed that a general model of decision making best described the data in that stable individual differences in decision and confidence processing emerged across tasks. However, with the exceptions of a significant effect of Desire for Structure on response time and of Need for Cognition on accuracy, there were no significant effects of the cognitive styles on decision and confidence processing. Hence, although stable individual differences in comparative judgment were clearly evident, the specific basis for these differences remains elusive.",38,7,1701,1713,Developmental psychology; Cognitive style; Psychology; Cognition; Personality; Self-confidence; Need for cognition; Information processing,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886904003526 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-04337-019 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886904003526,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.paid.2004.11.004,,10.1016/j.paid.2004.11.004,1998763358,,0,002-859-575-994-742; 003-367-522-420-396; 006-761-478-196-183; 010-850-588-940-830; 013-469-108-754-796; 014-324-264-054-563; 018-401-414-027-424; 018-955-357-466-133; 019-567-702-794-034; 023-237-989-608-093; 032-237-344-178-176; 032-508-737-715-712; 033-049-944-423-030; 034-104-968-527-083; 035-441-590-593-268; 040-019-129-633-273; 040-711-591-126-184; 041-904-749-135-441; 048-611-229-823-107; 053-476-438-379-307; 054-829-527-775-966; 063-164-530-924-988; 064-647-493-376-777; 065-232-329-332-520; 069-701-492-603-479; 074-545-378-776-594; 081-557-818-369-59X; 083-456-848-718-009; 084-356-019-234-435; 089-928-343-893-988; 090-720-369-234-780; 091-185-840-036-466; 093-130-523-307-300; 100-436-172-024-424; 103-481-679-240-101; 104-737-927-335-656; 109-919-678-885-014; 110-693-697-186-864; 113-072-235-058-355; 114-982-166-895-609; 116-953-447-460-185; 117-045-657-267-896; 125-894-267-538-829; 133-495-357-155-938; 148-223-435-969-407; 178-535-113-631-236; 186-982-576-848-065,49

Prior studies have often confounded desirability with commonness and have used subjective measures of comparative judgment that capitalize on people's tendency to conflate relative with absolute self-evaluation.",,,,,Psychology; Social comparison theory; Cognitive psychology; Positive illusions; Better than average; Overconfidence effect; Social psychology,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=775086 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=775086,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.775086,,10.2139/ssrn.775086,2149673788,,0,000-857-639-341-870; 001-539-529-845-798; 002-329-854-148-284; 003-498-762-032-886; 004-554-646-498-005; 004-949-838-366-871; 005-105-404-496-456; 005-553-153-856-945; 006-974-106-628-722; 007-082-882-552-460; 007-304-534-738-374; 007-613-518-980-709; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-527-796-645-068; 008-723-463-031-98X; 010-144-671-443-116; 011-614-660-441-019; 011-955-232-456-797; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-476-553-649-690; 014-250-530-986-293; 016-509-402-794-767; 016-818-713-659-772; 017-275-935-043-488; 019-866-129-447-784; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-021-272-761-642; 022-539-513-644-07X; 023-926-631-266-07X; 024-838-013-412-523; 025-498-944-344-037; 026-777-089-649-494; 026-890-870-955-11X; 027-085-969-250-317; 028-039-360-043-35X; 028-283-378-991-037; 028-586-840-019-669; 028-594-121-064-586; 030-252-574-645-692; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-117-245-322-535; 032-534-314-680-166; 032-678-588-289-474; 033-167-062-332-572; 034-762-931-378-138; 036-962-225-909-922; 038-074-204-043-936; 038-906-821-424-83X; 040-261-830-869-773; 040-269-259-341-705; 040-630-843-123-971; 042-511-079-550-038; 042-575-131-829-363; 043-042-734-594-449; 044-682-508-817-626; 048-924-036-705-953; 049-494-674-809-588; 050-119-397-343-775; 051-256-450-992-430; 052-772-137-045-338; 053-452-330-947-361; 055-430-043-798-32X; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-261-723-348-033; 056-926-960-371-839; 060-577-386-644-004; 061-142-370-003-855; 061-240-450-950-317; 061-748-308-588-588; 063-581-732-407-353; 063-956-106-105-022; 064-082-736-992-676; 064-966-564-119-742; 064-990-488-097-173; 065-541-759-883-380; 065-688-149-501-185; 065-796-557-496-125; 066-511-998-492-554; 066-922-859-214-884; 071-804-955-643-260; 073-663-750-011-207; 073-892-767-581-299; 076-391-942-699-520; 077-895-998-479-40X; 079-463-629-173-564; 079-620-280-853-749; 080-352-765-956-858; 081-070-448-534-951; 082-662-120-833-072; 083-594-730-550-103; 085-011-605-076-313; 085-774-844-448-036; 087-187-063-418-965; 090-589-468-914-713; 092-534-364-737-788; 092-807-060-801-913; 094-014-034-314-284; 094-133-760-710-451; 094-316-616-730-783; 096-490-415-009-371; 096-595-005-980-238; 096-792-630-788-615; 099-320-591-064-174; 102-006-703-875-491; 102-340-037-186-777; 102-795-542-679-792; 104-642-999-567-323; 105-013-326-768-571; 105-583-418-831-173; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 108-351-541-737-461; 108-996-667-045-776; 109-083-632-270-72X; 110-167-195-442-258; 112-726-334-016-592; 114-212-006-577-539; 114-590-207-496-477; 115-738-750-628-94X; 116-762-136-028-844; 116-971-242-715-630; 120-103-388-707-494; 120-413-940-804-073; 123-123-454-225-643; 124-245-702-599-698; 124-538-751-952-258; 124-656-535-257-223; 130-915-077-766-821; 131-100-530-138-436; 132-924-965-786-772; 133-919-199-742-753; 134-686-941-887-810; 134-807-367-235-76X; 134-947-078-599-350; 135-144-160-688-210; 137-443-946-255-057; 140-397-553-301-28X; 142-392-033-523-68X; 142-597-308-096-357; 143-745-527-313-014; 146-008-745-042-063; 146-951-314-180-066; 147-672-144-580-247; 148-223-435-969-407; 148-624-948-236-126; 153-051-112-288-562; 156-852-823-073-305; 157-705-653-746-365; 158-444-232-588-710; 160-652-532-329-575; 161-286-724-383-946; 163-368-978-140-006; 163-569-396-472-394; 164-221-695-958-73X; 166-148-082-833-226; 167-814-372-508-796; 180-613-410-178-805; 181-166-614-027-51X; 191-161-638-896-007; 191-268-502-924-793,8

From the beginning of theoretical fluid mechanics there was an interest in establishing the priorities of discoveries. For example in the controversy between Johann I Bernoulli and his son, Daniel. Subsequent historical accounts are represented by the works of Saint-Venant (1887) and Love (1901). More recent treatises on the history of mechanics, like that of Dugas (1950), Dijksterhuis (1956), Szabo (1979), dedicate many chapters to history of fluidmechanics. An innovative approach has been taken byTrusdell (1954), Whiteside (1974), Mikhailov (2002), in their essays on Euler, Newton, Daniel Bernoulli, respectively. These authors have exposed the details of the original papers, checked the correctness of the proofs, and, above all, expressed critical comparative judgments. The “critical” history of mechanics is now a flourishing discipline. This superb book by Darrigol is a compromise between descriptive and technical histories, since it provides a large account of the development of theoretical and engineering fluidmechanics accompanied byprecise explanations of howequations have been derived and which solution procedures have",42,1,107,108,Mathematical proof; Philosophy; Mathematical economics; Bernoulli's principle; Historiography; Fluid mechanics; Compromise; Correctness; Euler's formula; Prandtl number,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11012-006-9016-8,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11012-006-9016-8,,10.1007/s11012-006-9016-8,1569920253,,0,,0

Karylowski,"Previous research on absolute trait judgments regarding self and others showed that, compared to self-judgments, other-judgments involve greater focus on external, observable (as opposed to internal, unobservable) aspects of traits. The present research attempted to extend those findings to comparative judgments. In two experiments, Polish undergraduates (N = 144) were asked to perform a series of comparative self-other judgments followed by a series of absolute judgments regarding either the self or another person. The absolute judgments employed the same traits as the comparative judgments but with the trait preceded by a qualifier: either ""feels,"" referring to covert, unobservable aspects of the trait, or ""looks,"" referring to overt, observable aspects. As expected, comparative judgments correlated higher with absolute feels judgments regarding the self and with absolute looks judgments regarding the other than with absolute looks judgments regarding the self and absolute feels judgments regarding the other.

Johnston; Kenneth S. L. Yuen; David Healy; Rainer Goebel; Bettina Sorger; David Edmund Johannes Linden,"Neuroimaging biomarkers of depression have potential to aid diagnosis, identify individuals at risk and predict treatment response or course of illness. Nevertheless none have been identified so far, potentially because no single brain parameter captures the complexity of the pathophysiology of depression. Multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) may overcome this issue as it can identify patterns of voxels that are spatially distributed across the brain. Here we present the results of an MVPA to investigate the neuronal patterns underlying passive viewing of positive, negative and neutral pictures in depressed patients. A linear support vector machine (SVM) was trained to discriminate different valence conditions based on the functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data of nine unipolar depressed patients. A similar dataset obtained in nine healthy individuals was included to conduct a group classification analysis via linear discriminant analysis (LDA). Accuracy scores of 86% or higher were obtained for each valence contrast via patterns that included limbic areas such as the amygdala and frontal areas such as the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex. The LDA identified two areas (the dorsomedial prefrontal cortex and caudate nucleus) that allowed group classification with 72.2% accuracy. Our preliminary findings suggest that MVPA can identify stable valence patterns, with more sensitivity than univariate analysis, in depressed participants and that it may be possible to discriminate between healthy and depressed individuals based on differences in the brain's response to emotional cues.",2,,675,683,Psychology; Neuroscience; Ventrolateral prefrontal cortex; Mood disorders; Amygdala; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Caudate nucleus; Voxel; Resting state fMRI; Linear discriminant analysis,Affect; Depression; Emotion; LDA; MVPA; Valence,,,Medical Research Council (G1100629) United Kingdom,https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/11136 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3777671/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3777671 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Kenneth_Yuen/publication/258216410_Pattern_classification_of_valence_in_depression/links/0c960521276832f35b000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/pattern-classification-of-valence-in-depression https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2F04b09630-2ac1-4ee5-9d3c-76234a921929 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/62480/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000570 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158213000570 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/62480/1/Habes%202013.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/42515150 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/?term=Neuroimage+Clin.+2013%3B2%3A675-683 https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/11136/1/FullText.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82441311.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.nicl.2013.05.001,24179819,10.1016/j.nicl.2013.05.001,1971950154,PMC3777671,0,000-700-755-445-321; 000-877-297-364-607; 001-808-378-027-511; 002-394-371-946-661; 004-445-904-338-563; 004-482-945-837-96X; 004-902-583-754-961; 004-936-928-236-111; 005-972-401-377-043; 010-526-646-799-034; 010-608-302-383-237; 010-943-150-505-829; 012-414-332-018-81X; 015-657-814-514-176; 016-553-465-095-865; 016-821-913-682-392; 017-185-348-479-771; 019-768-536-549-658; 021-562-577-196-906; 022-582-294-128-588; 024-016-164-823-511; 025-655-384-503-015; 025-743-432-308-004; 026-753-122-338-73X; 028-524-595-405-158; 030-090-962-831-201; 031-569-193-257-508; 041-072-440-067-20X; 043-417-310-497-723; 043-853-528-560-765; 043-869-835-870-671; 044-909-864-281-892; 046-199-587-149-744; 047-224-660-944-524; 049-582-513-997-039; 050-844-249-775-711; 050-921-520-988-578; 056-617-231-631-38X; 058-533-037-604-649; 058-551-875-148-039; 060-129-260-881-988; 066-838-015-067-229; 068-926-733-851-272; 069-760-803-871-586; 070-713-814-364-778; 090-427-301-153-447; 092-101-317-810-58X; 092-307-014-407-121; 099-884-124-906-25X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 110-736-799-245-981; 113-181-977-747-005; 114-587-299-904-10X; 116-870-404-905-97X; 167-698-760-857-108; 173-801-956-493-713,20

Nonetheless, to increase its predictive power we introduced several behavioral options and additional factors in the same prediction model about drivers’ self-reported speed behavior on a road with a speed limit of 90 km/h. We investigated the TPB factors as well as descriptive norms, perceived similarity with/description of the prototypical driver, and past behavior with respect to three speed options (<90 km/h; [91 - 110 km/h]; +110 km/h). We also added self-description as a driver, comparative judgments about speeding risks, frequency of passengers, driving-related sensation seeking, and driving anger. Thus, 1192 French young drivers filled in an extended TPB question- naire about speed behavior and driving history. Participants reported driving at 101.85 km/h on a road with a speed limit of 90 km/h. The three options added 13% in the explained variance of speed behavior. A total of 60% of the variance in speed behavior was accounted for, with intentions to three options and perceived similarity with the driver complying and driving over 110 km/h as the best predictors. The implications of the results were discussed.",21,,122,132,Statistics; Sensation seeking; Engineering; Explained variation; Human factors and ergonomics; Predictive power; Anger; Speed limit; Poison control; Simulation; Theory of planned behavior,,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view/1285799 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847813000843 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00906219v1 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847813000843 https://hal-univ-tlse3.archives-ouvertes.fr/IFSTTAR/hal-00906219v1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2013.09.009,,10.1016/j.trf.2013.09.009,2075094724,,0,000-215-753-425-23X; 000-958-239-795-462; 000-999-951-820-28X; 001-263-962-588-804; 002-289-011-521-85X; 003-889-324-730-877; 005-398-650-973-213; 007-397-558-000-193; 007-602-685-475-941; 008-661-385-398-91X; 009-034-699-163-527; 010-181-149-926-740; 012-788-275-263-048; 015-141-050-251-662; 017-583-515-540-175; 028-873-129-324-161; 029-582-603-166-532; 029-658-972-798-410; 029-671-905-945-026; 030-579-537-412-798; 031-187-002-607-584; 032-272-019-008-732; 035-939-305-414-282; 037-906-334-812-409; 039-259-772-459-419; 040-734-046-090-747; 041-383-597-145-710; 041-860-680-626-354; 043-844-180-767-241; 043-887-353-146-049; 045-423-683-290-681; 058-363-181-661-307; 059-811-615-972-659; 060-850-242-365-596; 061-828-796-593-203; 064-560-274-566-405; 068-941-781-747-424; 069-024-646-575-074; 069-168-226-194-833; 073-725-072-478-764; 074-039-129-297-865; 074-331-217-488-467; 079-556-927-686-475; 080-615-193-600-603; 083-059-954-037-46X; 083-908-350-376-202; 086-804-915-904-336; 087-717-569-213-938; 089-801-115-265-412; 091-568-857-964-304; 091-830-525-268-194; 092-484-145-540-35X; 103-949-731-966-307; 105-317-460-074-477; 113-973-593-553-514; 114-556-841-480-844; 116-082-300-794-921; 130-538-468-865-658; 132-608-197-294-69X; 135-044-052-366-566; 135-348-648-876-762; 137-860-982-509-285; 146-279-237-937-236; 148-354-504-779-333; 148-722-380-243-815; 161-609-322-896-742; 167-225-244-728-465; 173-382-370-217-54X,30

The Random Regret approach is based on the idea that, when choosing, individuals aim to minimize their regret – regret being defined as what one experiences when a non-chosen alternative in a choice set performs better than a chosen one in relation to one or more attributes. The Random Regret paradigm, recently developed in transport economics, presents a tractable, regret-based alternative to the dominant choice paradigm based on Random Utility. Using data from a travel cost study exploring factors that influence kayakers’ site-choice decisions in the Republic of Ireland, we estimate both the traditional Random Utility multinomial logit model (RU-MNL) and the Random Regret multinomial logit model (RR-MNL) to gain more insights into site choice decisions. We further explore whether choices are driven by a utility maximization or a regret minimization paradigm by running a bina...",1,1,32,47,Recreation; Multinomial logistic regression; Economics; Choice set; Transport economics; Microeconomics; Regret minimization; Utility maximization; Regret; Mixed logit,,,,,https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/site-choices-in-recreational-demand-a-matter-of-utility-maximizat https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/13123250/Site_choices_in_recreational_demand_2.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/10073964 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/site-choices-in-recreational-demand-a-matter-of-utility-maximization-or-regret-minimization(13971a5e-12ae-4fe6-ad1c-893490375c44).html https://www.rti.org/publication/site-choices-recreational-demand-matter-utility-maximization-or-regret-minimization https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/21606544.2011.640844 https://rti.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/site-choices-in-recreational-demand-a-matter-of-utility-maximizat,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/21606544.2011.640844,,10.1080/21606544.2011.640844,2090084039,,0,000-608-500-375-681; 004-585-523-454-59X; 005-348-100-073-119; 007-543-370-814-809; 010-859-348-659-709; 011-226-085-814-653; 014-971-142-713-728; 015-396-400-600-856; 018-368-880-865-327; 021-717-813-601-621; 024-999-789-875-741; 026-407-847-324-51X; 033-937-403-200-198; 034-299-250-456-039; 035-097-147-017-063; 035-633-786-945-655; 035-720-079-041-011; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-116-456-474-608; 038-337-847-964-618; 038-356-136-783-128; 039-904-608-983-883; 040-123-765-881-892; 043-271-342-349-398; 044-582-725-837-916; 046-227-601-328-841; 046-694-564-607-640; 047-113-987-514-989; 052-217-341-775-087; 053-418-298-460-801; 055-678-870-126-470; 057-194-523-480-290; 057-657-809-679-383; 057-815-519-358-865; 065-826-666-183-202; 069-849-436-487-814; 074-071-861-181-580; 074-231-389-364-227; 080-145-744-681-590; 084-151-781-654-045; 087-713-669-205-654; 090-850-595-866-810; 091-600-098-706-618; 091-837-179-719-379; 098-376-587-660-420; 102-332-818-772-664; 103-056-993-198-151; 108-496-730-640-172; 110-604-658-933-41X; 111-310-941-717-950; 121-953-592-935-66X; 123-147-631-965-666; 128-599-009-988-402; 134-124-776-472-472; 140-829-652-037-935; 141-028-577-502-695; 153-973-893-703-837; 187-742-561-090-427; 192-484-174-111-760; 195-360-427-496-182,29

Yet in today's Europe it risks being marginalised amidst the actions and rhetoric of emergency – a norm to be waived in a state of exception, leaving decisions of lasting consequence shielded from public debate. A German constitutional theorist once famously defined as sovereign the one who has the power to declare the state of exception, and linked this power closely to executive suspensions of the law. The European setting invites a different understanding of an emergency regime: one that is manifest in the contravention of norms which may or may not be legally codified, and which is collectively produced by multiple actors. The persistence of politics in the emergency register indicates precisely the weakness of political authority. The article goes on to examine how exceptional this exceptionalism is. Is Europe's emergency politics a recent phenomenon, or has it been one of the currents of European integration from the beginning",63,2,300,318,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16672692.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.12072,,10.1111/1467-9248.12072,,,0,000-374-554-384-250; 003-248-594-846-407; 004-651-428-567-10X; 011-555-082-343-777; 014-521-753-796-536; 014-673-643-711-266; 016-100-769-932-755; 019-683-078-582-22X; 023-832-312-441-208; 024-619-228-222-145; 025-289-306-867-975; 030-552-064-801-223; 030-887-766-120-419; 036-684-170-567-875; 039-549-301-210-25X; 047-641-038-550-231; 055-750-486-685-01X; 057-325-880-313-412; 059-256-070-737-156; 063-551-035-048-693; 063-655-059-000-201; 071-115-973-247-663; 077-092-195-330-960; 080-066-923-417-183; 091-035-073-296-81X; 105-803-216-418-278; 109-246-047-050-535; 109-936-059-976-931; 127-156-159-060-408; 128-562-789-856-996; 130-093-948-027-822; 136-945-970-382-914; 153-574-792-145-479; 163-657-196-952-49X; 169-805-817-610-805; 174-603-965-941-097; 183-918-739-708-521,88

Thirty cats were randomized into three groups of ten animals based on pre-treatment flea counts: Group 1: imidacloprid/flumethrin collar; Group 2: fipronil/(s)-methoprene topical spot-on and Group 3: non-treated controls. The imidacloprid/flumethrin collars were applied one time on Day 0, while the fipronil/(s)-methoprene spot-on was administered every 30 days from Day 0 through Day 210. Cats were infested with 100 fleas on study days 0, 7, 14, 29, 59, 89, 119, 149, 179, 209 and 239. All flea counts were conducted by combing to remove fleas on post-treatment days 2, 8, 15, 30, 60, 90, 120, 150, 180, 210 and 240. The efficacy of the imidacloprid/flumethrin collar ranged from 98.2 to 100 % for eight months. The efficacy of fipronil/(s)-methoprene spot-on ranged from 68.2 to 99.9 %.

For estimation of the model, several methods based on the sum of weighted Kullback-Leibler divergences have been proposed from various contexts. The purpose of this letter is to interpret an estimation mechanism of the Bradley-Terry model from the viewpoint of flatness, a fundamental notion used in information geometry. Based on this point of view, a new estimation method is proposed on a framework of the em algorithm. The proposed method is different in its objective function from that of conventional methods, especially in treating unobserved comparisons, and it is consistently interpreted in a probability simplex. An estimation method with weight adaptation is also proposed from a viewpoint of the sensitivity. Experimental results show that the proposed method works appropriately, and weight adaptation improves accuracy of the estimate.",23,6,1623,1659,Statistics; Information geometry; Algorithm; Statistical model; Probability distribution; Expectation–maximization algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Mathematics; Point estimation; Artificial neural network,,"Algorithms; Models, Statistical; Regression Analysis",,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neco/neco23.html#FujimotoHM11 http://cognet.mit.edu/journal/10.1162/NECO_a_00129 https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/NECO_a_00129 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/21395441 https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/NECO_a_00129 https://waseda.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/an-estimation-of-generalized-bradley-terry-models-based-on-the-em https://doi.org/10.1162/NECO_a_00129 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21395441,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/neco_a_00129,21395441,10.1162/neco_a_00129,2167267147,,0,001-477-209-588-154; 005-932-334-805-223; 009-316-589-031-043; 011-105-391-999-886; 018-031-756-525-882; 018-211-014-689-579; 021-198-743-332-152; 021-526-803-476-474; 029-712-119-607-36X; 030-080-322-423-702; 033-678-697-379-221; 033-696-835-462-63X; 036-317-237-048-590; 039-403-886-481-722; 044-200-854-946-303; 046-335-758-388-920; 047-005-506-445-938; 059-637-706-576-095; 068-949-556-372-271; 079-009-271-909-556; 086-718-166-082-222; 087-991-691-200-809; 100-352-802-153-880; 105-532-622-360-153; 110-306-729-650-236; 113-278-954-446-219; 115-359-555-624-425; 147-094-625-084-736; 159-049-721-253-838; 187-464-751-052-539,3

005-664-757-831-02X,Large as being on top of the world and small as hitting the roof: a common magnitude representation for the comparison of emotions and numbers,2020-03-12,2020,journal article,Psychological research,14302772; 03400727,Springer Verlag,Germany,Giulio Baldassi; Mauro Murgia; Valter Prpic; Sara Rigutti; Drazen Domijan; Tiziano Agostini; Carlo Fantoni,"Previous work on the direct speed-intensity association (SIA) on comparative judgement tasks involved spatially distributed responses over spatially distributed stimuli with high motivational significance like facial expressions of emotions. This raises the possibility that the inferred stimulus-driven regulation of lateralized motor reactivity described by SIA, which was against the one expected on the basis of a valence-specific lateral bias, was entirely due to attentional capture from motivational significance (beyond numerical cognition). In order to establish the relevance of numerical cognition on the regulation of attentional capture we ran two complementary experiments. These involved the same direct comparison task on stimulus pairs that were fully comparable in terms of their analog representation of intensity but with different representational domain and motivational significance: symbolic magnitudes with low motivational significance in experiment 1 vs. emotions with rather high motivational significance in experiment 2. The results reveal a general SIA and point to a general mechanism regulating comparative judgements. This is based on the way spatial attention is captured toward locations that contain the stimulus which is closest in term of relative intensity to the extremal values of the series, regardless from its representational domain being it symbolic or emotional.",,,1,20,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Face perception; Cognitive psychology; Psychological research; Facial expression; Judgement; Relative intensity; Numerical cognition; Magnitude (mathematics),,,,Università degli Studi di Trieste (RESRIC-FANTONI2018),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166368 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/19181 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3 https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2964357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3,32166368,10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3,3010538513,,0,000-455-372-559-296; 000-554-668-882-790; 001-736-503-518-484; 001-995-708-037-242; 003-086-472-590-707; 003-683-845-316-328; 003-846-053-882-35X; 004-381-286-146-379; 004-451-533-015-01X; 004-731-567-191-050; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-402-735-113-601; 008-192-712-366-191; 008-323-657-407-735; 009-638-275-134-279; 009-804-637-120-597; 010-176-051-981-120; 010-187-743-570-895; 012-627-787-071-501; 012-765-147-718-763; 013-621-028-229-557; 013-783-022-449-657; 014-347-760-732-628; 014-477-778-845-298; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-264-055-000-686; 015-334-468-316-778; 015-803-870-149-321; 016-000-197-860-064; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-286-539-418-329; 016-374-298-162-237; 016-585-695-878-191; 017-029-116-133-38X; 017-096-212-135-705; 017-797-479-052-054; 018-765-388-536-256; 018-781-528-222-92X; 019-131-039-088-768; 021-566-111-190-893; 022-396-094-696-709; 025-703-813-430-701; 025-957-847-646-05X; 025-971-418-331-624; 027-012-971-940-520; 029-915-293-337-721; 032-049-177-406-929; 035-229-209-474-238; 035-522-074-408-50X; 036-459-179-538-121; 038-395-026-012-885; 039-762-466-320-740; 039-941-560-998-113; 046-522-618-604-832; 047-527-075-662-356; 048-939-869-477-889; 049-863-149-640-914; 050-728-327-300-677; 051-066-076-538-547; 053-591-751-927-115; 054-100-154-295-161; 054-649-302-531-591; 056-170-806-678-309; 057-183-336-446-253; 058-175-340-486-49X; 061-215-565-452-575; 061-556-739-571-730; 063-223-495-189-224; 066-608-905-207-154; 067-036-764-376-645; 067-715-519-706-692; 068-090-664-463-999; 073-811-902-344-708; 074-268-500-538-942; 077-955-155-009-954; 078-120-813-645-612; 078-649-785-249-179; 081-260-990-315-81X; 087-228-473-950-231; 087-300-622-382-439; 090-473-073-536-194; 097-118-699-603-908; 100-668-664-094-130; 101-033-639-064-930; 105-942-707-129-817; 106-197-189-659-701; 107-103-350-803-295; 114-992-167-812-755; 117-754-333-941-321; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-791-951-129-93X; 123-478-664-171-99X; 123-593-345-103-90X; 125-126-582-214-822; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 139-708-795-933-36X; 141-730-925-182-377; 149-229-185-800-505; 167-388-826-583-987; 175-397-495-157-485; 177-015-691-281-199; 196-022-041-043-935,1

Petrusic; Joseph V. Baranski,"Current theories of confidence in human judgment assume that confidence and the decision it is based on are inextricably tied to the same process (decisional locus theories) or that confidence processing begins only once the primary decision has been completed (postdecisional locus theories). In the absence of auxiliary assumptions, however, neither class of theory permits the judgment of confidence to affect primary decision processing. In the present study, we examined the effect of rendering confidence judgments on the properties of the decision process in a sensory discrimination task. An examination of the properties of the time taken to determine confidence (i.e., the time taken to render the judgment of confidence) revealed clear evidence of postdecisional confidence processing. Concomitantly, the requirement of confidence judgments was found to substantially increase decisional response times, suggesting that some confidence processing occurs during the primary decision process. We discuss the implications of these findings for contemporary models of confidence in human judgment.",10,1,177,183,Psychology; Cognition; Discrimination learning; SENSORY DISCRIMINATION; Size Perception; Some confidence; Human judgment; Decision process; Confidence interval; Social psychology,,"Adult; Analysis of Variance; Confidence Intervals; Decision Making; Decision Support Techniques; Differential Threshold; Discrimination Learning; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Probability Learning; Reaction Time; Set, Psychology; Signal Detection, Psychological; Size Perception",,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03196482.pdf https://paperity.org/p/10482247/judging-confidence-influences-decision-processing-in-comparative-judgments https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/12747505/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196482 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12747505,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03196482,12747505,10.3758/bf03196482,2075396194,,0,000-554-668-882-790; 002-384-534-341-028; 002-859-575-994-742; 003-541-006-629-223; 011-420-744-130-992; 014-677-379-840-306; 022-513-574-133-227; 023-392-288-632-015; 027-124-684-020-533; 035-680-847-266-325; 036-229-783-159-175; 036-748-447-200-073; 043-715-399-679-122; 045-182-421-927-57X; 046-954-441-557-960; 054-829-527-775-966; 061-214-352-934-509; 064-267-591-285-145; 078-102-464-781-552; 104-191-710-128-689; 113-983-434-837-682; 122-296-739-914-951; 134-589-821-529-459; 159-194-489-256-073; 175-397-495-157-485; 178-535-113-631-236; 195-926-955-146-573,68

Method: Adaptive resources/strategies and life satisfaction were measured in personal interviews with 164 community-dwelling older adults. Participants judged their physical activity compared with the average person of their age and wore an accelerometer for 24 hours. Commonality analysis was used to estimate unique versus shared effects of the resource/strategy variables on a residual measure of self-enhancement, obtained by adjusting the comparative judgments for participants' age and objectively measured physical activity. Results: Self-enhancement was positively related to life satisfaction. Perceived control and optimism had shared positive effects on self-enhancement, whereas downward social comparison had a unique positive effect.

According to Sen transcendental theories of justice are unnecessary. What we aim at is to justify a series of comparative judgements about two or more states of affairs.We do not strive, unlike Rawls, to form a complete system of moral principles that backs an «ideal just society». I try to show that Sen’s «comparative» account is weak. First of all, Sen does not offer a fair interpretation of Rawls’ theory. In particular, he is wrong when he depicts Rawls’ justice as fairness as a complete and transcendental moral doctrine. Secondly, Sen overlooks the fact that in order to justify comparative evaluations of states of affairs we must assume as valid a particular moral doctrine. Finally I try to solve the problem about the contrast between transcendental and comparative account by offering a transcendental outlook to questions of justice that is, at the same time, pluralist and incomplete.",0,42,183,197,Epistemology; Philosophy; Transcendental number; Pluralism (political theory); Doctrine; Moral particularism; Just society; Political philosophy,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco_Biondo/publication/49614526_Qu_podemos_pedir_a_una_teora_de_la_justicia_Algunas_consideraciones_acerca_de_un_debate_entre_Amartya_Sen_y_John_Rawls/links/00b4952b863182117f000000.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3308841 http://isegoria.revistas.csic.es/index.php/isegoria/article/view/690 http://www.acuedi.org/ddata/11248.pdf https://doaj.org/article/4b981ec1f2134c5e8e79b3e1ec926587 http://isegoria.revistas.csic.es/index.php/isegoria/article/viewFile/690/692,http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/isegoria.2010.i42.690,,10.3989/isegoria.2010.i42.690,2090090139,,0,,1

Therefore, infantile facial features have been considered a trigger for care-giving behavior. However, few studies have investigated the effect of age-independent traits of a child's face on adult preferences for a child. In this study, ninety-six Japanese undergraduates and ninety-six preschool children provided the facial images used in this study. We divided children's facial variations into age-related and age-independent traits using methodologies of geometric morphometrics. The age-independent variations were summarized using a principal component analysis. The facial pictures corresponding to theoretical values from −3SD to +3SD along with both the age-related dimension and age-independent principal components were made by warping the average facial texture of the children's faces. A pairwise comparison method was used to investigate the relationship between cuteness/infantility and facial shape differences along with the age-related and age-independent components using the facial pictures. The results suggest that an evaluation of a child's cuteness depends on both age-independent and age-related facial features.",97,,285,291,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Pairwise comparison; Principal component analysis; Morphometrics,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82686293 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281303680X https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82686293.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.235,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.10.235,2038213460,,0,003-717-303-272-271; 004-370-503-586-087; 012-242-609-597-642; 015-396-217-117-604; 023-186-356-317-061; 023-758-833-593-861; 025-932-013-164-002; 043-710-011-686-439; 055-017-382-968-654; 069-928-674-255-379; 098-457-110-503-49X; 105-988-374-540-31X; 109-351-620-462-95X; 118-034-803-459-750; 123-745-215-641-478; 161-496-596-663-702,4

Lötter,"In this article I respond to the thoughtful criticisms of my book articulated by Gillian Brock, Thaddeus Metz, and Darrel Moellendorf. Their critical questioning offers me an opportunity to reformulate aspects of the book so that I more accurately say exactly what I had in mind when writing the book. The first section contains a reworking of my definition of poverty to eliminate any ambiguity and demonstrate what kind of comparative judgements the definition allows us to make. The second section looks anew at the multiple moral sources for our obligation to eradicate poverty. In the third section I focus on issues that could hinder attempts at eradicating poverty. One is the lack of accessible knowledge that might be too demanding to acquire. The other is the possibility that all attempts to eradicate poverty might have to be put on hold until oppressive capitalist development has prepared the circumstances for a more socialist distribution of resources.

Starting from the description of user needs and logical architecture of the trip planner, the paper describes the module to support the user with pre-trip information based on his/her personal preferences. In particular the theoretical aspects of the individual, instead of user group (aggregate), path choice modelling used to support path choice set individuation, path utility calculation and user preference learning process are defined. The theoretical framework has been applied and tested through some experiments carried out on the public transport network of the metropolitan area of Rome.",5,,30,43,Real-time data; Engineering; Travel behavior; Metropolitan area; Choice set; Preference learning; Transport engineering; Planner; Choice modelling; Operations research; Public transport,,,,,https://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/112145 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146515000162 https://core.ac.uk/display/82281645 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146515000162 https://trid.trb.org/view/1342516 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82281645.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2015.01.015,,10.1016/j.trpro.2015.01.015,2037741414,,0,001-690-822-365-082; 021-156-094-638-083; 022-183-770-762-654; 029-875-386-645-48X; 035-776-610-863-582; 047-498-591-480-17X; 051-409-986-174-502; 057-078-287-471-529; 064-134-316-582-250; 065-871-811-844-728; 067-704-491-879-845; 073-390-036-392-590; 075-679-428-708-507; 078-388-715-615-804; 087-052-495-932-353; 095-627-726-137-168; 102-325-899-749-961; 106-635-975-642-779; 128-315-979-589-27X; 147-048-192-007-040; 148-778-706-780-85X; 160-673-269-506-425; 169-773-881-358-196; 199-617-719-045-849,18

One possible explanation for this egocentrism is that information about the self is more accessible than information about others. We examine this egocentrism in samples from the United States and Taiwan. Study 1 finds egocentrism in comparisons of the self with the average other person in both cultures. Study 2 measured reaction times, demonstrating that (a) information about the self is more accessible than information about the average other and (b) as the accessibility of self-information increases, so does the influence of that information.

Brain activity of preschoolers was obtained while they performed a numerical Stroop task. Participants were asked to decide which of two digits was numerically or physically larger. Behavioral distance and size congruity effects were found. However, a reverse facilitation was observed, where responses to neutral trials were faster than to congruent ones. Brain activity showed that 6-year-old children activate frontal areas related to conflict, as well as parietal areas related to mature numerical processing. Moreover, there was a difference between the timing of the interference compared to the facilitation components in the size congruity effect. In parietal areas, facilitation was significant in an early time window and interference was significant at a later time window. This is consistent with the idea that facilitation and interference are separate processes. Our findings indicate that children as young as 5-6 years old can automatically process the numerical meaning of numerals. In addition, brain activity during the numerical Stroop task showed that at this age, children use both frontal and parietal areas in order to process irrelevant numerical information.",4,,716,716,Brain activity and meditation; Facilitation; Psychology; Stroop effect; Neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Numeral system; Brain development; Distance effect; Time windows,ERP; automatic numerical processing; brain development; distance effect; size congruity effect,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00716/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00716/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00716/pdf https://doaj.org/article/7081b74f68454b72973184c28c384eca http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3800772 https://core.ac.uk/display/26589240 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3800772/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82880272.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00716,24155729,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00716,2087139861,PMC3800772,0,001-244-253-407-376; 005-691-887-337-576; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-720-683-958-49X; 009-688-288-795-004; 011-741-296-253-442; 013-621-298-749-675; 015-012-693-948-294; 023-254-266-920-133; 028-908-173-804-813; 029-570-353-718-673; 029-791-317-575-387; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-635-789-049-979; 033-722-538-050-23X; 033-987-957-285-504; 038-406-658-229-135; 040-395-538-000-329; 042-108-554-770-743; 045-735-184-813-268; 048-830-545-060-535; 051-839-955-755-136; 057-641-100-487-003; 065-309-058-996-650; 073-663-030-274-455; 074-441-357-197-861; 079-276-930-986-288; 080-398-235-691-622; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-849-249-876-733; 093-171-874-765-291; 104-898-249-163-45X; 110-878-263-543-335; 116-093-617-267-98X,2

Dzhafarov,"We develop a mathematical theory for comparative sorites, considered in terms of a system mapping pairs of stimuli into a binary response characteristic whose values supervene on stimulus pairs and are interpretable as the complementary relations ‘are the same’ and ‘are not the same’ (overall or in some respect). Comparative sorites is about hypothetical sequences of stimuli in which every two successive elements are mapped into the relation ‘are the same’, while the pair comprised of the first and the last elements of the sequence is mapped into ‘are not the same’. Although soritical sequences of this kind are logically possible, we argue that their existence is grounded in no empirical evidence and show that it is excluded by a certain psychophysical principle proposed for human comparative judgements in a context unrelated to soritical issues. We generalize this principle to encompass all conceivable situations for which comparative sorites can be formulated.",76,1,25,53,Epistemology; Empirical evidence; Cognitive science; Social connectedness; Vagueness; Mathematical theory; Closeness; Binary response; Mathematics; Sorites paradox; Logical possibility,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1755-2567.2009.01057.x/abstract https://www.math.uconn.edu/~damir/papers/sorites2.pdf http://www.math.uconn.edu/~damir/papers/sorites2.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/DZHSWV-2 http://www2.psych.purdue.edu/~ehtibar/publications/Comp%20Sorites%20%28post%29.pdf http://www.psych.purdue.edu/~ehtibar/publications/Comp%20Sorites%20%28post%29.pdf https://www1.psych.purdue.edu/~ehtibar/publications/Comp%20Sorites%20%28post%29.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1455024,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1755-2567.2009.01057.x,,10.1111/j.1755-2567.2009.01057.x,2009900939,,0,007-712-169-785-078; 014-906-518-144-105; 017-304-548-050-75X; 035-692-792-649-393; 038-143-726-588-796; 056-255-706-322-690; 062-021-851-566-080; 076-072-743-080-778; 079-211-300-962-663; 106-871-226-909-565; 138-432-626-243-615; 140-356-139-017-725; 159-165-590-691-771; 166-119-105-340-123; 167-444-311-637-96X; 177-379-048-785-31X,10

Vishton; Edward Fabre,"Many studies have suggested that visually-guided action is largely immune to the effects of several pictorial illusions that strongly influence perceptual judgments. The judgments in these experiments, however, have usually involved comparisons of multiple elements within a display, whereas the visually-guided actions have typically involved a pincer grip directed to only one display element. The three experiments presented here assess the influence of this confound on the perception versus action illusion dissociation. In general, the studies suggest (a) that the confound affects perceptual judgment but not grasping or manual estimation, and (b) that difficult visuomotor tasks are more affected by the Ebbinghaus illusion than easier tasks. In Experiment 1, participants reached for or made judgments about plastic disks placed in the center of the Ebbinghaus illusion display. Some participants reached for or made judgments about only the disk on the right, whereas others reached for or judged both disks simultaneously. A large effect of the illusion was found for grasping and comparative judgment, but not for manual estimation or metric judgment. In Experiment 2, the disks were elevated slightly to make gripping the targets easier, and the effects of the illusion on grasping were greatly reduced. For Experiment 3, participants performed the manual estimation task while the hands were placed in view, on the surface of the table, and the effects of the illusion were significantly increased. Taken together, the experiments indicate that task difficulty and hand visibility affect whether a task will be influenced by pictorial illusions or not. One- and two-handed grasping seem to be affected approximately equally.",16,3,377,392,Optical illusion; Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Illusion; Perception; Ebbinghaus illusion; Pincer grip; Space perception; Social psychology,,,,,https://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/journals/10.1163/156856803322467590 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12858958 https://brill.com/view/journals/sv/16/3/article-p377_12.xml?lang=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/156856803322467590,,10.1163/156856803322467590,2071798232,,0,,23

General,19392222; 00221015; 00963445,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Gaurav Malhotra; David S. Leslie; Casimir J. H. Ludwig; Rafal Bogacz,"The dominant theoretical framework for decision making asserts that people make decisions by integrating noisy evidence to a threshold. It has recently been shown that in many ecologically realistic situations, decreasing the decision boundary maximizes the reward available from decisions. However, empirical support for decreasing boundaries in humans is scant. To investigate this problem, we used an ideal observer model to identify the conditions under which participants should change their decision boundaries with time to maximize reward rate. We conducted 6 expanded-judgment experiments that precisely matched the assumptions of this theoretical model. In this paradigm, participants could sample noisy, binary evidence presented sequentially. Blocks of trials were fixed in duration, and each trial was an independent reward opportunity. Participants therefore had to trade off speed (getting as many rewards as possible) against accuracy (sampling more evidence). Having access to the actual evidence samples experienced by participants enabled us to infer the slope of the decision boundary. We found that participants indeed modulated the slope of the decision boundary in the direction predicted by the ideal observer model, although we also observed systematic deviations from optimality. Participants using suboptimal boundaries do so in a robust manner, so that any error in their boundary setting is relatively inexpensive. The use of a normative model provides insight into what variable(s) human decision makers are trying to optimize. Furthermore, this normative model allowed us to choose diagnostic experiments and in doing so we present clear evidence for time-varying boundaries.

As opposed to conventional laminated PM machines, such machines can offer zero cogging torque, sinusoidal torque curve angle yielding a machine with very smooth rotation, no laminated core loss, and negligible eddy current losses in rotor magnets. This paper presents the mathematical model and the characteristics analysis of slotless rotary PM machines compared to a conventional laminated design. An explicit analytical expression of slotless rotary machines is developed to calculate the electromagnetic torque on both the ${q}$ - and ${d}$ -axis current injections. The validity of an analytical calculation is confirmed by the finite element analysis. Subsequently, the performance comparisons of slotless and laminated designs are carried out using a statistical technique. The key results derived from the comparative study are expected to be a useful reference resource for decision makers who should make a comparative judgment.",4,2,517,524,Physics; Eddy current; Finite element method; Torque; Magnet; Cogging torque; Electromagnetic torque; Electromagnetic coil; Air gap (plumbing); Mechanical engineering,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&arnumber=8303735,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tte.2018.2810230,,10.1109/tte.2018.2810230,2792123362,,0,017-988-215-655-128; 030-459-139-903-958; 032-786-336-497-830; 032-874-720-948-018; 034-831-721-283-639; 040-185-552-763-415; 065-332-834-931-346; 086-008-657-823-754; 097-149-863-802-485; 101-990-608-745-471; 132-767-097-574-203; 147-025-546-030-183; 157-398-612-315-465; 174-797-040-802-501,5

Oddershede,"This paper presents a method to characterize, select and evaluate technological options to produce ferric chloride. The methodology uses AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process) enhanced with fuzzy logic (FEAHP). With this methodology it is possible to include the vagueness associated with the evaluators in the decision making to evaluate a new business and select technologies. Producing ferric chloride will reduce or eliminate effluents from the molybdenum production process, such as ferrous chloride, reducing environmental contamination of the process and achieving a potential new business. A model was designed using existing literature on AHP, FEAHP and other assessment tools to select technologies and evaluate new businesses that reduce environmental impact. The model was validated using a case study related to using ferrous chloride, which is an effluent from the molybdenum leaching process, producing ferric chloride that can be transformed into a new business with the benefit of reducing environmental pollution. By applying the extended AHP method with fuzzy logic to model the uncertainty of the experts regarding the comparative judgments, the analysis performed in this work allowed to discard technological options to reprocess the ferrous chloride and to obtain ferric chloride, leaving finally two options that were the alternatives with greater weight, which later were evaluated economically. The method facilitates decision making regarding the selection or prioritization of technologies to evaluate new business in environmentally sensitive areas. The contribution of this work is the proposed method based in FEAHP to select technologies to produce a product and open a new market. The method allowed selecting options of technology in a rare business with great environmental impact for the zone. In the case study the results indicated the desirability of not increasing the production by more than 25%, discarding, for example, options of doubling the production because of the environmental risks.",,,47,51,Environmental impact assessment; Biochemical engineering; Scheduling (production processes); Prioritization; Chloride; Ferric; Environmental pollution; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8390435/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icccc.2018.8390435,,10.1109/icccc.2018.8390435,2809524930,,0,010-812-941-614-60X; 026-956-162-761-241; 039-128-728-508-463; 058-689-112-924-572; 064-019-047-386-169; 069-604-346-895-747; 073-764-420-108-877; 082-694-402-642-49X; 122-111-875-781-870,0

Many healthcare systems wish to foster transparency and accountability in the decisions they make by incorporating the public in decision-making processes. This paper presents a unique conceptual approach exploring the public’s preferences for health service innovations by viewing healthcare innovations as ‘bundles’ of characteristics. This decompositional approach allows policy-makers to compare numerous competing health service innovations without repeatedly administering surveys for specific innovation choices. Methods: A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to elicit preferences. Individuals chose from presented innovation options that they believe the UK National Health Service (NHS) should invest the most in. Innovations differed according to: (i) target population; (ii) target age; (iii) implementation time; (iv) uncertainty associated with their likely effects; (v) potential health benefits; and, (vi) cost to a taxpayer. This approach fosters multidimensional decision-making, rather than imposing a single decision criterion (e.g., cost, target age) in prioritisation. Choice data was then analysed using scale-adjusted Latent Class models to investigate variability in preferences and scale and valuations amongst respondents. Results: Three latent classes with considerable heterogeneity in the preferences were present. Each latent class is composed of two consumer subgroups varying in the level of certainty in their choices. All groups preferred scientifically proven innovations, those with potential health benefits that cost less. There were, however, some important differences in their preferences for innovation investment choices: Class-1 (54%) prefers innovations benefitting adults and young people and does not prefer innovations targeting people with ‘drug addiction’ and ‘obesity’. Class- 2 (34%) prefers innovations targeting ‘cancer’ patients only and has negative preferences for innovations targeting elderly, and Class-3 (12%) prefers spending on elderly and cancer patients the most. Conclusions: DCE can help policy-makers incorporate public preferences for health service innovation investment choices into decision making. The findings provide useful information on the public’s valuation and acceptability of potential health service innovations.

Here, we introduce an easy experimental protocol of comparative judgments that can rank and scale subjective stimulus intensity using a comparatively small number of trials. On each trial in our protocol, the observer initially views M stimuli sampled from a space of N stimuli and selects the stimulus that elicits maximum subjective response along a given dimension (e.g., the most attractive). The selected stimulus is subsequently discarded, the observer then performs a judgment on the remaining stimuli, and the process is iterated until the last stimulus remains and a new trial begins. The method relies on sorting perceived stimulus order in the N x N comparison matrix via logistic regression and sampling the next set of M stimuli such that responses will be collected only for stimulus pairs whose expected response ratio is most informative. Numerical simulations demonstrate that this method can estimate psychological scale with a small number of responses. Psychophysical experiments confirm that the method can quickly estimate the contrast response function for gratings and the perceived glossiness of naturalistic objects. This protocol would be useful for characterizing human judgments along various dimensions, especially those with no physical image correlates such as emotional and social attributes.",15,5,e0233568,,Small number; Sorting; Iterated function; Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Perception; Computer science; Luminance; Observer (quantum physics),,Emotions; Humans; Judgment; Psychology/methods; Psychophysics,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science; National Institute of Information and Communication Technology,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32470031/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0233568 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7259756,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0233568,32470031,10.1371/journal.pone.0233568,3031402526,PMC7259756,0,000-174-264-797-907; 000-876-430-609-593; 001-060-521-763-259; 003-198-583-089-698; 004-135-383-805-678; 004-774-480-663-545; 009-915-266-094-36X; 010-716-829-230-251; 010-861-246-666-935; 014-009-260-910-895; 014-136-157-239-951; 016-098-271-053-956; 017-434-103-039-318; 018-160-317-039-752; 023-707-591-457-591; 033-544-571-821-842; 034-055-612-612-932; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-363-107-596-537; 037-394-655-311-086; 038-388-243-511-079; 039-892-298-356-511; 042-735-453-795-477; 045-928-955-459-174; 058-761-128-703-639; 060-963-638-617-762; 061-878-397-223-77X; 070-691-346-358-486; 073-789-373-695-87X; 074-017-562-218-104; 079-709-450-933-663; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-596-457-656-058; 091-522-334-493-212; 092-627-827-859-558; 093-339-390-763-149; 097-440-693-993-234; 097-522-534-270-708; 099-432-075-001-835; 102-372-296-507-391; 134-413-452-769-975; 139-638-582-629-742; 148-738-002-816-897; 156-568-834-481-218; 178-684-166-406-250,0

Carmen Parafita Couto; C. Alejandro Parraga,"This article argues that 2-alternative forced choice tasks and Thurstone’s law of comparative judgments ( Thurstone, 1927 ) are well suited to investigate code-switching competence by means of acceptability judgments. We compare this method with commonly used Likert scale judgments and find that the 2-alternative forced choice task provides granular details that remain invisible in a Likert scale experiment. In order to compare and contrast both methods, we examined the syntactic phenomenon usually referred to as the Adjacency Condition (AC) (apud Stowell, 1981 ), which imposes a condition of adjacency between verb and object. Our interest in the AC comes from the fact that it is a subtle feature of English grammar which is absent in Spanish, and this provides an excellent springboard to create minimal code-switched pairs that allow us to formulate a clear research question that can be tested using both methods.",8,1,67,97,Two-alternative forced choice; Likert scale; Adjacency list; English grammar; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Law; Verb; Research question; Syntax,,,,,https://www.jbe-platform.com/content/journals/10.1075/lab.16030.sta https://aquila.usm.edu/fac_pubs/16785/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1075/lab.16030.sta,,10.1075/lab.16030.sta,2704582094,,0,008-743-997-631-144; 010-760-548-426-993; 011-557-577-920-600; 012-518-040-072-765; 017-339-630-939-398; 022-334-816-639-172; 024-848-286-367-819; 025-009-658-071-875; 027-246-516-221-50X; 028-422-206-398-04X; 028-435-730-337-414; 028-920-007-403-645; 030-002-966-168-731; 030-489-742-735-861; 031-007-785-414-576; 032-043-612-192-578; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-978-605-128-175; 037-489-690-702-690; 038-627-258-791-494; 040-426-826-812-777; 043-820-568-587-494; 049-607-331-953-789; 049-792-782-499-033; 054-224-864-001-134; 054-262-434-625-737; 056-709-402-467-827; 060-520-569-280-939; 061-456-053-369-580; 064-584-435-133-608; 065-906-991-595-286; 067-370-899-754-58X; 073-342-896-870-242; 074-069-533-445-505; 075-678-524-844-707; 078-555-511-915-894; 078-681-530-169-759; 078-908-680-304-34X; 082-348-990-295-006; 083-436-017-769-253; 085-055-169-973-02X; 086-244-662-917-012; 090-352-910-418-486; 095-343-050-791-375; 096-470-853-334-483; 096-738-334-847-02X; 101-594-801-481-100; 102-406-152-972-262; 103-372-941-997-802; 109-082-924-158-073; 111-397-649-399-267; 116-998-364-997-20X; 117-279-381-151-703; 119-807-763-409-203; 121-526-831-922-190; 129-021-929-376-164; 129-652-800-291-443; 129-733-252-722-402; 130-157-085-973-564; 130-511-891-296-042; 135-007-255-181-833; 136-091-991-879-608; 137-220-145-121-915; 144-415-268-113-863; 155-898-154-381-024; 158-732-370-004-900; 167-251-046-893-143; 167-931-487-839-184; 181-219-181-907-875; 187-136-144-512-166; 188-161-438-936-15X; 198-754-631-432-902; 199-026-050-625-547; 199-055-961-488-187,37

Forde; Nathalie Martin; Alexandre Voirin; Johannes le Coutre; Micah M. Murray; Julie Hudry,"Although neuroimaging research has evidenced specific responses to visual food stimuli based on their nutritional quality (e.g., energy density, fat content), brain processes underlying portion size selection remain largely unexplored. We identified spatio-temporal brain dynamics in response to meal images varying in portion size during a task of ideal portion selection for prospective lunch intake and expected satiety. Brain responses to meal portions judged by the participants as 'too small', 'ideal' and 'too big' were measured by means of electro-encephalographic (EEG) recordings in 21 normal-weight women. During an early stage of meal viewing (105-145 ms), data showed an incremental increase of the head-surface global electric field strength (quantified via global field power; GFP) as portion judgments ranged from 'too small' to 'too big'. Estimations of neural source activity revealed that brain regions underlying this effect were located in the insula, middle frontal gyrus and middle temporal gyrus, and are similar to those reported in previous studies investigating responses to changes in food nutritional content. In contrast, during a later stage (230-270 ms), GFP was maximal for the 'ideal' relative to the 'non-ideal' portion sizes. Greater neural source activity to 'ideal' vs. 'non-ideal' portion sizes was observed in the inferior parietal lobule, superior temporal gyrus and mid-posterior cingulate gyrus. Collectively, our results provide evidence that several brain regions involved in attention and adaptive behavior track 'ideal' meal portion sizes as early as 230 ms during visual encounter. That is, responses do not show an increase paralleling the amount of food viewed (and, in extension, the amount of reward), but are shaped by regulatory mechanisms.",113,,133,142,Insula; Developmental psychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Neuroscience; Superior temporal gyrus; Inferior parietal lobule; Gyrus; Middle frontal gyrus; Middle temporal gyrus; Electroencephalography,EEG; Food image; Meal; Portion size; Satiety,Adult; Attitude; Body Weight; Brain/physiology; Cerebral Cortex/physiology; Eating/physiology; Electroencephalography; Female; Frontal Lobe/physiology; Humans; Judgment; Meals/psychology; Nutritive Value; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Satiety Response/physiology; Temporal Lobe/physiology,,"Swiss National Science Foundation; Faculty of Biology and Medicine, University of Lausanne; Swiss Brain League",https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/849291 https://core.ac.uk/display/82720109 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.041 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25812716 https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.041 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915002232 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage113.html#ToepelBFMVCMH15 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915002232 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25812716 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.041 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82720109.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.041,25812716,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.041,1966103673,,0,000-631-466-342-266; 000-898-597-151-307; 004-655-745-030-718; 006-380-589-584-518; 007-930-199-340-18X; 008-522-436-344-058; 009-425-685-151-793; 010-760-018-635-560; 011-343-533-553-155; 011-878-959-455-289; 014-097-507-157-122; 014-123-674-683-169; 014-202-846-469-333; 015-021-474-988-573; 015-995-996-116-903; 016-202-101-109-045; 017-226-645-020-578; 020-357-930-865-279; 021-454-867-882-658; 021-939-828-336-14X; 022-293-386-847-888; 023-004-118-277-578; 028-259-564-129-627; 028-355-808-109-690; 030-434-391-426-953; 034-219-193-387-299; 034-991-008-221-021; 036-680-500-114-863; 043-322-794-326-813; 043-355-292-667-272; 043-434-545-465-018; 043-546-472-794-764; 043-745-984-939-244; 044-671-144-249-344; 046-643-231-571-07X; 047-017-417-614-830; 048-620-670-472-656; 053-663-854-733-727; 053-865-564-386-478; 054-630-493-941-883; 056-250-443-137-57X; 058-262-462-235-037; 058-373-952-885-448; 059-424-379-092-456; 060-312-779-115-206; 063-063-822-786-000; 063-631-783-222-343; 064-014-858-643-349; 066-248-503-256-651; 067-841-912-510-140; 068-807-138-606-588; 070-617-748-703-128; 071-021-905-834-455; 078-560-099-422-487; 095-182-416-339-881; 095-718-057-924-52X; 096-227-151-768-252; 096-383-714-976-958; 101-121-421-463-680; 102-260-698-890-921; 104-898-249-163-45X; 105-795-303-486-167; 121-712-863-668-894; 128-134-214-287-701; 132-704-783-287-337; 138-045-730-675-573; 141-834-622-967-931; 158-061-495-213-621; 164-771-637-458-012,19

These indicate that the target is perceptually suppressed by internal object representations of AM stimuli established along the AM trajectory. Here, we showed that transient sounds presented together with AM stimuli could enhance the magnitude of AM interference. Furthermore, this auditory effect attenuated when frequencies of the sounds were inconsistent during AM. We also confirmed that the sounds wholly elevated the magnitude of AM interference irrespective of the inconsistency in orientation information between the target and AM stimuli when the saliency of the sounds was maintained. These results suggest that sounds can contribute to the robust establishment and spatiotemporal maintenance of the internal object representation of an AM stimulus.",59,,25,33,Salience (neuroscience); Trajectory; Stimulus (physiology); Artificial intelligence; Interference (wave propagation); Internal object; Detection performance; Computer vision; Computer science; Communication,,"Acoustic Stimulation/methods; Analysis of Variance; Humans; Motion Perception/physiology; Perceptual Masking; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychoacoustics; Recognition, Psychology/physiology",,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698912000521 https://core.ac.uk/display/82423805 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698912000521 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22406661 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82423805.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2012.02.008,22406661,10.1016/j.visres.2012.02.008,2008909562,,0,000-722-820-145-577; 001-849-601-113-369; 002-624-517-283-153; 002-862-145-653-937; 004-528-025-114-567; 009-546-281-792-915; 010-530-127-705-421; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-588-739-006-988; 013-950-329-613-867; 014-989-230-936-636; 015-097-529-101-193; 015-611-485-487-010; 016-526-129-405-429; 017-811-108-259-847; 018-074-145-306-832; 019-056-911-374-672; 020-310-316-828-293; 020-738-309-468-581; 023-586-371-878-126; 024-291-384-023-475; 026-175-710-955-935; 028-235-920-841-789; 028-448-932-384-73X; 031-324-485-402-628; 032-979-958-815-005; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 046-019-648-037-981; 046-965-483-493-241; 047-281-722-081-949; 047-475-014-781-923; 047-523-005-893-070; 072-297-327-742-746; 073-519-220-562-398; 075-231-314-368-887; 088-606-183-684-002; 095-488-096-333-406; 098-600-046-537-941; 115-154-429-277-750; 125-905-306-739-705; 131-199-540-105-358; 159-194-489-256-073; 166-794-016-174-783; 176-830-609-863-988,3

They also judged the difference between them (comparative judgment). The applicants were described by features (grades) in different subjects (dimensions). The grades on some dimensions were missing (unique dimensions) for an alternative while all the grades were available on other dimensions (common dimensions). In a conventional regression analysis, we found that decision makers gave more weight to dimensions when they were common than when they were unique. However, this commensurability effect was limited to medium important dimensions and did not apply to dimensions of high or low importance. We also observed how participants retrieved information for the choice alternatives and analysed how importance and commensurability are reflected in the processing prior to the decision. Features on more important or common dimensions were inspected earlier than features on less important or unique dimensions. Participants preferred dimensional transitions and inspected features on unique dimensions longer than their common counterparts.

Vibrotactile perception was assessed using sinusoidal amplitude-modulated vibratory stimuli of constant energy level (r.m.s. acceleration, 0.41 m/s2) having a carrier frequency of 26 Hz (i.e. engine firing frequency) and modulation frequency of 6.5 Hz (half-order engine harmonic). Evaluations of seven levels of modulation depth parameter m(0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) were performed in order to define the growth function of human perceived disturbance as a function of amplitude modulation depth. Two semantic descriptors were used (unpleasantness and roughness) and two test methods (the Thurstone paired-comparison method and the Borg CR-10 direct evaluation scale) for a total of four tests. Each test was performed using an independent group of 25 individuals.

Nezlek; Aleksandra Jaskółowska; Magdalena Maria Formanowicz,"In his reply to our critique of research on self-humanizing, Haslam claims that we used a narrow definition of self-humanizing that ignored the evidence from the correlational research he and his colleagues have done. We disagree. First, we relied upon a definition of self-humanizing based upon comparative judgments that Haslam and colleagues have consistently used. Second, we were well aware of the correlational research he and his colleagues have done. We simply did not think, and do not think, these correlations verified the existence of self-humanizing as defined. In his reply, Haslam offered a new definition of self-humanizing that defines self-humanizing in terms of correlations between comparative judgments and ratings of how much traits reflect human nature. Although we believe this change represents some progress, numerous issues in the study of self-humanizing remain to be resolved.

Williamson; Hubert Eiholzer; Aaron Williamon,"What sets a great music performance apart? In this study we addressed this question through an examination of value judgements in written criticism of recorded performance. One hundred reviews of recordings of Beethoven’s piano sonatas, published in the Gramophone between 1934 and 2010, were analyzed through a three-step qualitative analysis that identified the valence (positive/negative) expressed by critics’ statements and the evaluation criteria that underpinned their judgements. The outcome is a model of the main evaluation criteria used by professional critics: aesthetic properties, including intensity, coherence, and complexity, and achievement-related properties, including sureness, comprehension, and endeavor. The model also emphasizes how critics consider the suitability and balance of these properties across the musical and cultural context of the performance. The findings relate directly to current discourses on the role of evaluation in music criticism and the generalizability of aesthetic principles. In particular, the perceived achievement of the performer stands out as a factor that drives appreciation of a recording.",7,,391,391,Aesthetics; Music psychology; Psychology; Piano sonata; Generalizability theory; Performance science; Poison control; Comprehension; Musical; Social psychology; Criticism,Beethoven; aesthetic judgment; music criticism; performance; recordings,,,"Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung; Staatssekretariat für Bildung, Forschung und Innovation",https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391/abstract http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391 http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/96020/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82851409 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4814455/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391/full http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4814455 http://researchonline.rcm.ac.uk/58/ https://philpapers.org/rec/ALEACE https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82851409.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391,27065900,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00391,2311169058,PMC4814455,0,007-465-771-470-516; 015-689-928-622-147; 015-778-326-735-35X; 021-192-240-921-062; 025-628-297-600-737; 031-056-855-501-837; 036-032-393-087-859; 036-234-774-729-355; 045-374-804-549-971; 045-496-353-057-235; 046-270-546-865-460; 049-435-759-049-979; 050-292-840-543-325; 052-322-599-429-311; 059-273-300-441-794; 065-632-380-813-701; 067-702-601-213-712; 072-636-289-362-809; 074-520-920-816-816; 074-886-608-147-845; 082-464-166-468-210; 083-658-932-918-199; 087-800-853-299-166; 091-141-620-077-747; 103-257-987-066-890; 109-248-360-826-060; 122-316-531-493-866; 122-982-356-281-130; 123-136-157-892-75X; 133-395-565-308-232; 135-580-180-023-68X; 144-678-533-596-339; 151-506-236-704-818; 153-333-352-506-085; 154-661-395-623-619; 165-800-259-391-426; 176-583-163-063-445; 178-189-633-816-163,2

Harris; Geoffrey Bird; Caroline Catmur; Ulrike Hahn,"Received academic wisdom holds that human judgment is characterized by unrealistic optimism, the tendency to underestimate the likelihood of negative events and overestimate the likelihood of positive events. With recent questions being raised over the degree to which the majority of this research genuinely demonstrates optimism, attention to possible mechanisms generating such a bias becomes ever more important. New studies have now claimed that unrealistic optimism emerges as a result of biased belief updating with distinctive neural correlates in the brain. On a behavioral level, these studies suggest that, for negative events, desirable information is incorporated into personal risk estimates to a greater degree than undesirable information (resulting in a more optimistic outlook). However, using task analyses, simulations and experiments we demonstrate that this pattern of results is a statistical artifact. In contrast with previous work, we examined participants’ use of new information with reference to the normative, Bayesian standard. Simulations reveal the fundamental difficulties that would need to be overcome by any robust test of optimistic updating. No such test presently exists, so that the best one can presently do is perform analyses with a number of techniques, all of which have important weaknesses. Applying these analyses to five experiments shows no evidence of optimistic updating. These results clarify the difficulties involved in studying human ‘bias’ and cast additional doubt over the status of optimism as a fundamental characteristic of healthy cognition.",90,,71,127,Neural correlates of consciousness; Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Optimism; Optimism bias; Motivated reasoning; Normative; Frequentist probability; Social psychology; Pessimism,Bayesian belief updating; Belief updating; Human rationality; Motivated reasoning; Optimism bias; Unrealistic optimism,"Adult; Bayes Theorem; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Models, Psychological; Optimism; Pessimism; Risk; Young Adult",,Wellcome Trust ​ (099775/Z/12/Z) International,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2016-40950-001 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493340/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27542765 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/a-pessimistic-view-of-optimistic-belief-updating https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010028516301177 https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/a-pessimistic-view-of-optimistic-belief-updating(3f9d763e-d3c2-473e-85ee-09b5aad2d502).html http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/15855/ https://core.ac.uk/display/45320252 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81973069.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2016.05.004,27542765,10.1016/j.cogpsych.2016.05.004,2477954704,,0,000-985-833-321-140; 001-005-232-157-146; 001-539-529-845-798; 001-751-921-817-765; 001-934-180-563-105; 002-308-526-395-03X; 003-009-872-447-492; 003-258-105-238-013; 003-383-775-533-217; 003-708-115-592-927; 003-772-594-918-248; 005-386-878-457-09X; 005-762-601-105-119; 006-224-854-383-123; 007-971-351-895-691; 008-072-067-938-612; 008-077-003-420-817; 009-904-776-264-070; 011-634-281-853-003; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-345-726-958-230; 014-250-530-986-293; 015-182-711-254-088; 015-729-242-727-482; 016-137-262-831-356; 016-509-402-794-767; 017-514-925-843-559; 018-657-482-201-278; 018-659-617-698-533; 018-757-245-440-011; 018-913-251-103-718; 019-200-757-553-43X; 020-419-379-272-121; 021-084-421-891-191; 023-009-813-155-057; 023-592-253-976-527; 024-347-825-695-163; 024-838-013-412-523; 025-743-006-635-619; 027-186-789-368-775; 027-273-617-907-184; 028-366-022-540-837; 029-058-747-897-018; 030-650-295-042-614; 031-227-293-084-894; 031-492-170-610-468; 031-672-019-523-79X; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-226-395-265-065; 033-009-098-614-033; 033-049-944-423-030; 033-548-214-151-316; 035-069-792-527-930; 035-320-853-443-878; 035-466-534-087-345; 039-950-357-101-301; 040-269-259-341-705; 040-393-388-962-653; 042-393-851-063-506; 044-003-372-741-839; 044-749-462-483-766; 048-162-912-738-432; 049-563-285-918-744; 050-147-175-661-223; 050-235-436-459-972; 050-441-130-528-450; 051-662-002-879-569; 052-895-760-401-381; 055-209-565-108-549; 057-314-491-943-548; 057-464-547-623-206; 057-761-715-276-049; 062-523-541-536-898; 063-325-395-878-388; 065-688-149-501-185; 068-063-760-048-417; 068-983-415-786-648; 069-320-925-370-967; 070-028-651-223-405; 075-728-778-957-843; 076-573-740-478-364; 082-662-120-833-072; 086-373-927-285-964; 091-266-533-217-130; 092-636-335-385-258; 096-476-861-580-032; 102-837-709-226-131; 103-246-940-710-411; 104-642-999-567-323; 104-737-927-335-656; 105-583-418-831-173; 107-854-421-865-889; 110-310-697-272-147; 111-952-975-809-794; 112-323-440-003-406; 114-590-207-496-477; 114-691-342-364-998; 117-128-486-711-406; 125-444-589-110-130; 127-800-985-139-059; 133-326-502-649-508; 141-238-834-943-893; 141-241-418-288-911; 148-223-435-969-407; 148-466-217-179-980; 148-934-615-737-903; 150-968-603-215-558; 157-154-715-950-882; 166-538-828-667-900; 171-430-553-845-718; 176-518-856-760-971; 181-166-614-027-51X; 186-476-798-590-360; 192-777-815-726-191; 193-067-862-938-429,34

Learning, memory, and cognition",02787393; 19391285,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Benjamin E. Hilbig; Rüdiger F. Pohl,"According to part of the adaptive toolbox notion of decision making known as the recognition heuristic (RH), the decision process in comparative judgments-and its duration-is determined by whether recognition discriminates between objects. By contrast, some recently proposed alternative models predict that choices largely depend on the amount of evidence speaking for each of the objects and that decision times thus depend on the evidential difference between objects, or the degree of conflict between options. This article presents 3 experiments that tested predictions derived from the RH against those from alternative models. All experiments used naturally recognized objects without teaching participants any information and thus provided optimal conditions for application of the RH. However, results supported the alternative, evidence-based models and often conflicted with the RH. Recognition was not the key determinant of decision times, whereas differences between objects with respect to (both positive and negative) evidence predicted effects well. In sum, alternative models that allow for the integration of different pieces of information may well provide a better account of comparative judgments.",35,5,1296,1305,Machine learning; Heuristics; Artificial intelligence; Evidential reasoning approach; Psychology; Cognition; Recognition heuristic; Toolbox; Ignorance; Decision process; Evidence based decision making; Social psychology,,"Adolescent; Adult; Analysis of Variance; Concept Formation/physiology; Decision Making/physiology; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Psychological Theory; Random Allocation; Reaction Time/physiology; Recognition, Psychology/physiology; Young Adult",,Universität Mannheim,https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/25679/ http://core.ac.uk/display/12075363 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ860047 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19686022 http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0016565 https://ub-madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/25679/ https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2009-12193-015,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0016565,19686022,10.1037/a0016565,2018035995,,0,005-401-967-598-321; 006-240-462-825-885; 007-060-749-004-206; 009-188-129-583-580; 013-331-505-668-726; 016-438-253-383-845; 022-842-832-878-481; 025-206-322-285-127; 026-386-320-411-297; 027-564-285-840-47X; 028-543-783-527-092; 031-702-613-467-916; 044-729-100-505-384; 046-171-638-427-624; 051-262-764-422-271; 054-257-232-622-312; 061-026-023-073-551; 061-872-928-762-290; 067-715-519-706-692; 069-967-924-571-836; 070-242-387-647-387; 076-538-809-196-696; 082-782-368-991-978; 082-869-904-742-660; 113-067-244-251-003; 117-787-922-429-079; 121-995-943-980-434; 124-533-351-959-896; 128-003-457-348-142; 128-627-785-491-971; 132-957-177-004-275; 133-074-186-014-472; 133-084-666-343-813; 162-434-954-479-124,65

There have been significant changes in the approaches to teaching and learning in higher education with the advent of MOOCs, flipped classroom approaches, the introduction of informal learning spaces, the gamification of learning and the expectation of more flexible modes of delivery. We have not seen as much activity in the assessment area to align these changes in teaching with how we use assessment (Guardia, in press). Technology has promoted changes in our understanding of how curricula might be designed and delivered but new approaches to assessment are still needed. Usercentred approaches to assessment involving authentic assessment tasks are now being discussed more often (Mora, Sancho-Bru, Iserte, & Sanchez, 2012; Mueller, 2014). This special edition captures some of the recent investigations in e-assessment that move us beyond the traditional selected response formats of multiple-choice tests, short answer, fill-in-the-blanks, true-false, and matching. Higher-level cognitive and affective skills cannot readily be assessed using traditional selected response formats and more authentic e-assessments are being proposed (Kuh, Jankowski, Ikenberry, & Kinzie 2014). The paper by James explores the outcomes of a trial of an online final examination in a first year distance education psychology course invigilated via webcam. The study argued for the need to deliver better high stakes assessment to distance education students in a way that aimed to enhance convenience for students while maintaining the validity of the testing process. In this study about one quarter of students in the trial were initially enthusiastic however it was not until they had completed a practice online invigilated exam that the majority of these elected to decline the online approach to their final examination. The paper summarises the process and the concerns of students with this type of assessment. The findings demonstrated the importance of complex contextual matters such as technology compatibility, network reliability, clear communication, logistics and support available for students when implementing new computerised approaches to high stakes assessment. The paper by Gil-Jaurena and Kucina outlines the TALOE (Time to Assess Learning Outcomes in E-learning) project that developed a web tool for teachers so that they could make informed choices on how to assess online courses.

Brain imaging studies have implicated a specific parietal region in symbolic number processing, leading to the influential hypothesis that this region is the locus of a dedicated, domain-specific number system. Here we evaluated a prediction of this hypothesis, that this region should be activated not only by symbolic but also nonsymbolic number processing. Using nonsymbolic stimuli, we tested for higher parietal activations for number than for nonnumber comparison tasks (experiment 1), fMRI adaptation for numerosity repetition (experiment 2), and greater fMRI increases with increasing task difficulty for number than nonnumber tasks (experiment 3). None of these predictions were supported by the data, posing a serious challenge to the hypothesis that a single, domain-specific parietal region underlies both symbolic and nonsymbolic number representation.",44,3,557,569,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; fMRI adaptation; Parietal lobe; Domain specificity; Generality; Communication; Neuroimaging; Arabic numerals,,"Brain Mapping; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Mental Processes/physiology; Oxygen/blood; Parietal Lobe/blood supply; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Semantics; Time Factors; Visual Perception/physiology",Oxygen,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627304006762 https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(04)00676-2 https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(04)00676-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15504334 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82095902.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.008,15504334,10.1016/j.neuron.2004.10.008,2071188585,,0,001-991-099-807-96X; 004-766-465-240-165; 008-264-527-907-902; 008-373-567-331-285; 008-665-806-861-262; 011-744-832-669-630; 014-175-100-464-076; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-992-070-091-075; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-475-041-635-253; 017-847-796-822-545; 019-198-395-259-670; 020-978-265-730-463; 021-948-263-369-837; 026-063-149-060-733; 031-316-795-276-233; 033-275-799-706-24X; 033-987-957-285-504; 041-336-821-970-618; 042-847-786-411-546; 048-346-642-507-912; 048-889-201-158-674; 050-920-091-472-041; 051-472-129-782-759; 055-819-286-435-748; 058-425-023-345-414; 058-978-410-071-695; 059-737-872-709-592; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-248-380-698-666; 067-583-756-505-85X; 071-274-642-268-839; 072-157-343-216-127; 075-549-085-444-419; 080-858-924-947-675; 082-836-606-228-849; 083-185-707-713-368; 083-977-531-138-026; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-960-334-718-350; 098-719-348-115-531; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-271-458-280-827; 110-878-263-543-335; 111-855-715-195-891; 115-773-251-340-945; 116-093-617-267-98X; 116-953-283-915-381; 120-891-934-941-617; 130-711-043-551-297; 144-923-580-981-260; 164-046-578-199-011; 171-593-731-182-440; 175-669-419-032-492,159

One view assumes a trade-off between probabilities and outcomes (or non-linear functions thereof) and the separate evaluation of risky options (expectation models). Another view assumes that risky choice is based on comparative evaluation, limited search, aspiration levels, and the forgoing of trade-offs (heuristic models). We derived quantitative process predictions for a generic expectation model and for a specific heuristic model, namely the priority heuristic (Brandstatter et al., 2006), and tested them in two experiments. The focus was on two key features of the cognitive process: acquisition frequencies (i.e., how frequently individual reasons are looked up) and direction of search (i.e., gamble-wise vs. reason-wise). In Experiment 1, the priority heuristic predicted direction of search better than the expectation model (although neither model predicted the acquisition process perfectly); acquisition frequencies, however, were inconsistent with both models. Additional analyses revealed that these frequencies were primarily a function of what Rubinstein (1988) called ""similarity."" In Experiment 2, the quantitative model comparison approach showed that people seemed to rely more on the priority heuristic in difficult problems, but to make more trade-offs in easy problems. This finding suggests that risky choice may be based on a mental toolbox of strategies.",4,,646,646,Data mining; Heuristics; Econometrics; Cognition; Heuristic; Process tracing; Toolbox; Quantitative model; Comparative evaluation; Key features; Computer science,heuristics; process tracing; risky choice; similarity; strategy selection,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82884266 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24151472 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3784771 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:2098423 https://doaj.org/article/df09b01c50c448b997731c86d241371e https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00646/full https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_2098423 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/testing-process-predictions-models-risky-choice-quantitative-model-comparison-approach/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00646/abstract https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24151472/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82884266.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00646,24151472,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00646,2121117297,PMC3784771,0,000-153-084-716-249; 001-445-984-500-92X; 002-637-781-188-254; 004-418-254-315-402; 005-107-894-544-949; 005-401-967-598-321; 005-879-470-000-235; 007-060-749-004-206; 007-757-716-913-454; 008-321-805-497-084; 012-579-350-863-553; 013-181-612-012-035; 017-986-356-224-445; 018-507-291-199-685; 019-836-578-724-954; 023-157-701-092-551; 024-042-382-609-803; 024-302-367-595-050; 025-206-322-285-127; 025-694-407-413-71X; 025-907-321-316-616; 026-883-294-935-202; 030-101-460-623-526; 030-236-766-189-636; 030-396-213-673-738; 031-390-808-092-923; 031-915-885-410-20X; 032-514-517-294-910; 033-754-881-367-919; 033-853-192-784-198; 034-215-304-757-427; 034-299-250-456-039; 035-551-103-254-363; 036-368-017-698-989; 036-593-635-132-692; 037-764-443-482-743; 039-376-603-759-560; 041-049-773-563-310; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-184-374-255-140; 042-271-805-589-536; 045-421-586-936-971; 048-462-540-606-184; 048-853-153-918-127; 049-942-892-771-836; 050-096-647-578-608; 050-732-588-713-682; 054-792-451-511-721; 055-151-211-180-034; 059-952-107-888-652; 061-565-090-117-06X; 061-872-928-762-290; 062-061-509-231-37X; 063-336-878-735-553; 063-410-297-450-683; 065-762-052-067-91X; 067-982-068-347-040; 070-981-036-428-392; 070-993-200-557-013; 071-753-769-302-254; 071-805-295-839-042; 073-595-876-564-796; 074-529-604-461-92X; 076-011-229-020-378; 076-396-688-233-268; 076-684-196-189-674; 078-062-344-664-147; 079-211-300-962-663; 079-454-144-658-438; 082-782-368-991-978; 088-279-490-229-098; 090-188-383-241-516; 091-940-459-009-174; 094-319-788-369-270; 094-399-041-650-104; 095-787-407-375-612; 099-632-707-150-545; 099-862-885-637-616; 099-975-358-173-689; 107-745-018-119-285; 111-605-427-110-644; 111-616-725-986-410; 113-098-143-769-868; 117-412-958-132-575; 121-995-943-980-434; 122-201-915-306-804; 124-533-351-959-896; 125-348-819-879-94X; 125-444-589-110-130; 127-886-376-253-091; 134-875-956-046-363; 135-760-699-474-266; 141-297-264-024-974; 153-040-463-645-070; 154-778-166-552-844; 164-120-172-706-581; 166-121-386-520-253; 166-254-921-592-937; 179-412-054-144-847; 180-662-663-208-559; 188-038-356-421-335; 191-865-809-006-829; 197-509-186-434-735; 197-931-137-248-585,36

Bowman; David Liu; Andrew N. Meltzoff; Henry M. Wellman,"Theory of mind requires belief- and desire-understanding. Event-related brain potential (ERP) research on belief- and desirereasoning in adults found mid-frontal activations for both desires and beliefs, and selective right-posterior activations only for beliefs. Developmentally, children understand desires before beliefs; thus, a critical question concerns whether neural specialization for belief-reasoning exists in childhood or develops later. Neural activity was recorded as 7- and 8-year-olds (N = 18) performed the same diverse-desires, diverse-beliefs, and physical control tasks used in a previous adult ERP study.

In a case study concerning food quality attributes of chicken breast filets, we find evidence of ordering effects in a sequence of 16 choice sets, where the last 8 choice sets are identical to the first 8. The overall preference structure is found to differ significantly between the two identical sequences of choice sets, and significant increases in marginal WTP are found for two out of four attributes. We find a reduction in the error variance for the last 8 choice sets relative to the first 8 choice sets. In particular, this difference is ascribed to the first choice set obtaining a significantly higher error variance than all succeeding choice sets, suggesting institutional learning rather than preference learning effects underlying the observed ordering effect. This is further supported by the fact that the differences in WTP become insignificant when removing the first choice set from the analysis. We find no evidence of fatigue, and we argue that our findings cannot be explained by starting point or strategic behavior effects.",5,2,19,37,Econometrics; Economics; Choice set; Preference learning; Error variance; Strategic behavior; Institutional learning; Chicken breast,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514 https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/23769/1/gupea_2077_23769_1.pdf http://www.icmconference.org.uk/index.php/icmc/ICMC2011/paper/view/281 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514 https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/23769 https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/66841 https://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/2549747243 https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/the-first-time-is-the-hardest-a-test-of-ordering-effects-in-choic https://www.economics.handels.gu.se/digitalAssets/1445/1445644_jcm-2012.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82375966.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70051-4,,10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70051-4,1504476705,,0,000-473-076-666-811; 002-182-787-085-215; 006-339-706-723-472; 007-882-134-399-654; 010-221-964-938-581; 011-533-127-161-292; 012-033-003-071-864; 017-111-352-560-976; 019-792-526-204-891; 021-694-571-951-135; 022-454-770-002-120; 023-188-069-993-218; 028-864-828-247-228; 031-810-415-073-770; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-778-764-795-063; 039-458-058-680-804; 042-998-017-618-583; 044-386-297-822-639; 046-292-238-288-021; 046-522-033-816-151; 056-306-008-250-391; 057-657-809-679-383; 060-375-428-941-483; 061-441-838-070-43X; 062-345-124-074-46X; 063-745-188-026-319; 064-235-859-755-296; 069-584-139-587-21X; 073-125-290-693-818; 074-071-861-181-580; 074-236-575-939-517; 081-567-835-944-997; 084-620-154-173-76X; 088-902-572-148-592; 100-440-892-234-712; 103-027-645-446-531; 107-781-135-837-372; 107-937-677-557-525; 109-978-804-265-036; 110-918-754-580-61X; 112-258-103-767-706; 112-822-906-532-331; 113-059-561-380-183; 115-678-995-328-02X; 120-856-193-188-774; 132-914-230-472-749; 137-700-671-939-277; 150-691-699-172-556; 154-369-567-201-976; 164-260-106-908-120; 184-039-891-540-554; 188-592-643-972-920; 193-466-601-325-93X; 197-061-894-348-472,82

Yet, valid and reliable measures of proof comprehension remain rare. In this article, we present a study investigating proof comprehension via students’ summaries of a given proof. These summaries were evaluated by expert judges making pairwise comparisons, which were used to generate a score for each summary. This approach, known as comparative judgement, has been demonstrated to generate reliable and valid scores when assessing other mathematical constructs. Our findings suggest that comparative judgement can produce valid and reliable assessments of the quality of student-produced proof summaries. We also explored which features of students’ proof summaries were most valued by the expert judges, and found that high-scoring summaries referenced a proof’s logical structure and the mechanism by which it reached a contradiction.",105,2,181,197,Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Structure (mathematical logic); Natural language processing; Judgement; Contradiction; Comprehension,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Comparative_judgement_proof_summaries_and_proof_comprehension/12936137 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x,,10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x,3091030379,,0,005-534-847-537-136; 005-946-820-946-248; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-886-709-886-069; 026-318-747-461-037; 035-375-011-253-259; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-550-015-414-716; 040-241-846-826-833; 045-673-327-913-653; 047-410-827-372-679; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 052-556-386-273-247; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-022-905-420-746; 069-370-358-754-90X; 073-116-065-897-65X; 076-163-610-880-070; 078-719-290-790-749; 080-111-772-128-72X; 080-193-587-992-227; 087-814-704-580-867; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-790-299-676-96X; 090-794-868-877-416; 095-339-879-052-599; 098-742-019-688-692; 100-403-081-167-218; 104-581-513-132-471; 117-467-871-744-796; 120-249-326-102-774; 122-448-167-938-324; 126-454-221-798-016; 128-903-523-677-504; 149-433-841-504-551; 163-379-589-157-078; 166-315-357-513-375; 174-885-774-292-15X; 176-786-786-040-880; 183-648-179-920-825; 194-531-401-693-345,1

Myers; Eileen M. Finnegan,"Summary Arthur Lessac developed a voice training approach that concentrated on three energies: structural action, tonal action, and consonant action. In Lessac-Madsen Resonant Voice Therapy (LMRVT), speech-language pathologists help patients achieve a resonant voice through structural posturing and awareness of tonal changes. However, LMRVT many not necessarily include the third component of Lessac's approach: consonant action.This study examines the effect that increased effort on consonant production has on the speaking voice—particularly regarding vocal loudness and projection. Methods Audio samples were collected from eight actor participants who read a monologue using three distinct styles: normal articulation, poor articulation (elicited using a bite block), and overarticulation (elicited using a Lessac-based training intervention). Twenty graduate students of speech-language pathology listened to speech samples from the different conditions and made comparative judgments regarding articulation, loudness, and projection. Results Group results showed a strong correlation between the articulatory condition and the level of perceived loudness and projection. That is, as precision of articulation increased, the ratings of perceived loudness and projection increased, as well. Conclusions These findings indicate that articulation treatment may have a positive influence on the perception of vocal loudness and projection.

The present study explored the neural correlates associated with processing semantic end values under conditions of automatic number processing. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants performed the numerical Stroop task, in which they were asked to compare the physical size of pairs of numbers, while ignoring their numerical values. The smallest end value in the set, which is a task irrelevant factor, was manipulated between participant groups. We focused on the processing of the lower end values of 0 and 1 because these numbers were found to be automatically tagged as the “smallest.” Behavioral results showed that the size congruity effect was modulated by the presence of the smallest end value in the pair. ERP data revealed a spatially extended centro-parieto-occipital P3 that was enhanced for congruent versus incongruent trials. Importantly, over centro-parietal sites, the P3 congruity effect (congruent minus incongruent) was larger for pairs containing the smallest end value than for pairs containing nonsmallest values. These differences in the congruency effect were localized to the precuneus. The presence of an end value within the pair also modulated P3 latency. Our results provide the first neural evidence for the encoding of numerical end values.

Even after great effort there is a small chance independent raters would agree on their mutual ratings which undermines the reliability of the rating. Several assessment methods and their merits are described in literature, among them the use of rubrics and the use of comparative judgement (CJ). In this study we investigate which of the two methods is more efficient in obtaining reliable outcomes when used for assessing texts. The same 12 texts are assessed in both a rubric and CJ condition by the same 6 raters. Results show an inter-rater reliability of .30 for the rubric condition and an inter-rater reliability of .84 in the CJ condition after the same amount of time invested in the respective methods. Therefore we conclude that CJ is far more efficient in obtaining high reliabilities when used to asses texts. Also suggestions for further research are made.",,,13,25,Rubric; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Judgement; Assessment methods; Computer science,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-97807-9_2 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-97807-9_2,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-97807-9_2,,10.1007/978-3-319-97807-9_2,2885948248,,0,005-434-585-444-395; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-835-635-889-106; 019-101-486-661-637; 020-492-282-615-504; 021-738-595-719-412; 024-388-542-186-052; 034-259-628-733-602; 038-896-674-017-161; 040-971-330-680-09X; 047-356-439-744-528; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-200-117-576-394; 068-124-584-046-362; 068-582-222-430-445; 083-725-611-954-305; 089-878-093-999-671; 091-601-760-058-681; 095-171-448-851-907; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-790-959-417-375; 121-161-560-636-803; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-659-660-814-933; 136-606-604-022-63X; 142-958-267-774-764; 165-389-321-547-720,0

Keulen,"Gellius appears to pay homage to the celebrated aspects of Herodes Atticus, representing himself as one of the Roman pupils who were attracted by Herodes brilliant Greek eloquence, and were invited to his villa at Cephisia. This villa can be viewed as a site of memory, remembering its visitors of Herodes significant aristocratic lineage. In Gellius ideological perspective, the villa becomes a symbol of Herodes seductive eloquence. Gellius reader is continually challenged to weigh different types of intellectuals against each other, and Herodes own authority as judge is no exception to this pattern. This chapter looks at Herodes role of scrutiniser of professed philosophical authority. Evidence of architectural and sculptural elements from historical context may help to reanimate and enrich the visual and monumental dimensions of Gellius literary representation of Herodes Atticus, a representation which is shaped and informed by Roman traditions, and reflects ideology of Gellius Roman cultural programme.Keywords: Aulus Gellius; Greek sites; Herodes; judgments; memory; philosophical authority; Roman cultural programme; Roman traditions; villa at Cephisia",,,269,312,Literature; Symbol; Art; Reflexive pronoun; Ideology; Aristocracy,,,,,https://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.58 https://brill.com/view/book/9789047443421/Bej.9789004169869.i-364_013.xml?language=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.58,,10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.58,889919804,,0,,0

This has been incorporated internationally into many institutions offering engineering education courses. Characterized by four unique stages, the CDIO framework affords an ideal scenario to incorporate a continuous assessment model. This paper presents a proposed synthesis between CDIO and Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ). In particular, the opportunity to provide feedback through the ACJ system is theorized to have potentially positive educational effects. As part of a larger study, this approach is in the process of being refined prior to implementation as a pilot study for feasibility which will ultimately be succeeded by large-scale implementation to determine any potentially positive effect sizes.",82,2,11,16,Competence (human resources); Engineering management; Higher education; Educational assessment; Adaptive comparative judgement; CDIO; Computer science; Formative assessment; Engineering education; Continuous assessment,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1353697 http://www.edgj.org/index.php/EDGJ/article/view/683 https://research.thea.ie/handle/20.500.12065/2823 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1211915 http://www.edgj.org/index.php/EDGJ/article/download/683/468,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1353697,,,2953687026,,0,,0

In a series of 7 experiments we report such evidence. Participants respond quicker when the dominant element in a pair is presented on the left (or top) rather than on the right (or bottom). The left-anchoring tendency reverses in a sample with Farsi background (reading/writing from right to left). Alternative explanations and confounds are tested.

Brett Hauber; AF Mohamed; Juan Marcos Gonzalez; Helen Collins; Guy Hechmati; F Gatta; Yi Qian,"Objective: Several characteristics of bone-targeted agents are considered when making treatment decisions. This study evaluated physicians’ therapy preferences for preventing skeletal-related events (SREs) in patients with bone metastases secondary to solid tumors. Methods: A Web-enabled, discrete-choice experiment online survey was conducted among physicians who treated patients with bone metastases and solid tumors in the United States. Respondents chose between pairs of hypothetical medications defined by combinations of six attributes at varying levels for two hypothetical patients. Preference weights for attribute levels were estimated using a randomparameters logit model. Results: In total, 200 physicians completed the survey. Their mean age was 52 years, 57% were in practice for more than 15 years, 37% were oncologists, and 65% treated 10 or fewer patients with bone metastases weekly. Out-of-pocket cost to patients was the most important attribute overall. Among clinical outcomes, time to first SRE and risk of renal impairment were the most important attributes. Statistically significant preferences were observed for all attribute levels for time to first SRE, risk of renal impairment, and mode of administration. Predicted choice probability analysis showed that physicians preferred a hypothetical medication with attributes similar to those of denosumab over one with attributes similar to those of zoledronic acid. Conclusions: Physicians indicated that clinical attributes are important when considering bone-targeting therapy for bone metastases, but consistent with the current health care landscape, patient out-of-pocket cost was the most important. With health care costs being increasingly shifted to patients, physicians require accurate information about co-pays and assistance programs to avoid patients receiving less costly, yet potentially inferior, treatment.",18,1,78,83,Internal medicine; Surgery; Logistic regression; Health care; Denosumab; Zoledronic acid; Conjoint analysis; In patient; Mean age; Pharmacotherapy; Medicine,bone metastases; conjoint analysis; discrete-choice experiment; drug therapy attributes; preferences; skeletal-related events; treatment,Adult; Antineoplastic Agents/adverse effects; Attitude of Health Personnel; Bone Density Conservation Agents/adverse effects; Bone Diseases/chemically induced; Bone Neoplasms/drug therapy; Data Collection/methods; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Physician's Role; United States/epidemiology,Antineoplastic Agents; Bone Density Conservation Agents,Amgen,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301514047299 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301514047299 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25595237 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.004 https://www.rti.org/publication/physicians-preferences-bone-metastases-drug-therapy-united-states https://core.ac.uk/display/82086680 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82086680.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.004,25595237,10.1016/j.jval.2014.10.004,1997257564,,0,002-838-832-172-510; 003-464-876-020-319; 005-435-600-000-739; 012-711-922-488-564; 022-857-414-321-05X; 023-699-401-560-76X; 023-984-545-596-051; 026-582-284-480-399; 033-438-297-489-955; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-411-067-725-755; 041-619-619-078-191; 046-852-526-558-260; 050-428-053-189-646; 057-657-809-679-383; 063-696-496-668-120; 065-999-272-534-503; 071-485-812-700-285; 071-674-642-056-169; 085-710-454-872-728; 093-429-387-075-600; 098-687-797-960-139; 117-177-442-655-01X; 119-777-093-066-875; 131-708-658-403-388; 133-010-345-122-663; 134-038-540-989-60X; 164-260-106-908-120,20

009-845-548-351-730,Private technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and national development : The South African reality,2008-12-01,2008,dissertation,,,,,Salim Akoojee,"This thesis examines the extent to which the private Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Sector in South Africa is responsive to national development. National development is understood as associated with a range of socioeconomic imperatives which include challenges of poverty, unemployment, inequality, the ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its associated impacts. In addition to these, the educational component of national development is to ensure access, redress and equity, which are necessary to undo the impacts of an apartheid-related skills regime. Skills development is considered a crucial means to respond to these challenges. Without skills for formal and informal labour markets, as well as productive self-employment, South Africa’s capacity to respond to the new globalised era is likely to be considerably stunted and will negatively affect its developmental trajectory. The methodology used in this study included a mix of quantitative and qualitative strategies to obtain the size, shape and nature of provision. The quantitative component, undertaken in the course of 2002, was supplemented by randomly chosen qualitative case studies. Together, they provided the basis for unravelling a sector distinct in nature, form and content. Developing a comprehensive typology provides important insight into responsiveness of a sector characterised by wide-ranging provision forms. The typology of provider type based on profitability and form, i.e. ‘for-profit’, ‘non-profit’ and ‘in-house’ providers, was replaced with a multi-dimensional model. Learner type, as a primary typological category, includes the ‘pre-employed’, ‘unemployed’, the employed ‘selffunded employee’ and the ‘corporate client’. Provider types responding to these learner types are distinguished on the basis of location, delivery patterns and programming. The various provider forms include ‘multi-providers’, ‘specialist providers’, ‘consultants’, ‘in-house’ and ‘non-profit’ providers. Provider purposes include those responding to employment, either formal labour market or selfemployment, and self-development, including leisure-related skilling and lifelong learning. Learner types and training purpose determine the manner, form and characteristics of provision. This understanding of a widely divergent and heterogeneous sector provides the context for assessing its contribution to national development in South Africa. The notions of responsiveness and receptiveness are used as conceptual devices to assess the role of the sector. Responsiveness describes specific labour market purpose, while receptiveness refers to the social development and educational imperatives of access, redress and equity. The sheer size of the sector suggests an important demand-led element of provision and represents an important measure of receptiveness to national development prerogatives. The conservative estimate of 706 884 learners, located at 4178 sites for 864 providers that pre-registered with the Department of Education in 2001, provide the basis for serious consideration of the sector. The sector adequately responds to the immediate short-term needs of employers. Programmes offered for corporate providers respond more deliberately to their immediate short-term skill requirements and which has made it possible for them to outsource a considerable proportion of their training. In addition, there is no other education and training form flexible enough to provide for the training needs of employees, and sometimes the customers of corporate concerns, as in product upgrading and support, at times and locations suitable to their requirements. Private providers did not necessarily have more linkages with the formal labour market than do public providers and are not necessarily able to secure more effectively employment opportunities for their preand unemployed learners With respect to receptiveness, the sector comprises learner patterns consistent with national demographics. The sector is associated with an older, employed learner type, typically enrolled in shorter-term courses. This demonstrates the sector’s accessibility. In comparison with their public counterparts, costs were not prohibitive and programme structure allowed adequate flexibility to enable learners to weave in and out of the system. Variable admission requirements also allowed learners to slot into appropriate levels. The absence of data makes comparative judgements of throughput, and quality, with public institutions difficult to make. The current need to regulate all providers equally may not be the most efficient way of dealing with the sector. In light of the national development prerogative to protect those most vulnerable from the risk of market failure, there is need to grant support to those providers most responsive to this group in this instance, those ‘full time’ providers responding to the preand unemployed learner set. The market adequately regulates providers responding to the employed and corporate client groups.",,,,,Lifelong learning; Higher education; Comparative education; Marketing; Political science; Market failure; Further education; Full-time; Medical education; Vocational education; Education policy,,,,,http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/10539/5855/1/Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf http://www.lmip.org.za/sites/default/files/documentfiles//Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/5855/Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf?sequence=1 http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/5855 http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/5855/Thesis%20Abstract%20-%20Akoojee%20-%20Private%20TVET%20in%20South%20Africa%20-%20070925.pdf?sequence=2,http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/5855,,,161485479,,0,003-248-749-057-50X; 003-803-083-053-309; 005-238-254-302-028; 005-842-010-761-931; 007-075-755-402-763; 007-424-165-576-90X; 007-760-651-139-150; 008-568-541-949-263; 009-556-825-348-644; 010-027-967-887-346; 010-835-000-813-211; 011-400-374-092-934; 011-720-031-328-928; 012-898-575-910-427; 012-934-742-034-766; 013-098-346-613-219; 013-531-207-839-917; 013-532-095-802-259; 014-015-335-346-303; 014-458-119-298-565; 015-328-778-235-139; 016-832-453-582-131; 019-175-648-768-552; 019-625-357-734-868; 020-884-523-153-420; 022-098-013-428-433; 022-837-775-020-609; 023-489-770-028-28X; 023-846-976-381-356; 024-403-493-304-077; 024-771-845-884-511; 024-781-812-756-555; 025-534-896-497-818; 026-061-422-094-928; 026-069-188-943-894; 026-108-196-216-143; 026-550-711-985-935; 027-610-501-516-151; 027-805-988-872-309; 029-633-599-758-320; 030-506-989-758-952; 030-988-749-595-247; 031-053-000-227-883; 032-323-918-734-014; 033-077-701-739-952; 035-836-484-283-115; 036-415-520-040-489; 037-207-192-092-481; 037-795-985-384-058; 037-925-340-936-073; 038-206-569-175-730; 044-900-626-955-176; 046-699-951-199-264; 046-704-908-225-82X; 047-297-779-929-521; 048-390-030-542-07X; 049-522-829-827-066; 049-940-818-221-968; 050-882-428-673-929; 055-498-815-134-39X; 056-999-656-921-83X; 057-426-773-373-922; 057-902-590-156-620; 059-056-207-712-050; 059-404-026-983-407; 059-528-247-337-243; 060-224-640-529-383; 060-602-217-718-705; 063-102-656-135-016; 065-601-835-403-628; 069-423-915-534-392; 070-365-824-959-398; 071-837-551-305-725; 072-383-696-023-828; 072-606-577-555-878; 072-966-930-008-082; 073-456-592-782-433; 075-721-244-547-709; 077-304-473-075-763; 077-319-547-848-602; 077-424-712-197-132; 078-092-385-115-141; 079-044-108-102-385; 079-301-735-154-779; 083-330-782-905-51X; 083-416-194-421-09X; 083-876-259-634-350; 085-985-560-943-705; 086-939-296-774-437; 086-998-976-774-246; 087-361-238-973-663; 088-158-357-054-072; 088-737-814-154-615; 089-275-894-774-998; 089-438-882-469-295; 090-093-093-993-750; 091-461-418-513-253; 091-917-040-798-180; 092-243-611-241-086; 092-595-071-557-037; 095-430-098-687-732; 095-747-067-487-557; 096-004-694-181-468; 096-483-223-507-936; 097-649-685-266-085; 098-542-838-860-066; 099-574-517-934-100; 099-953-330-898-859; 100-020-968-222-62X; 100-767-382-538-470; 101-956-860-174-755; 105-185-008-792-200; 108-300-923-259-418; 108-551-892-616-975; 109-486-136-864-373; 110-015-055-680-841; 110-655-919-945-196; 111-611-261-421-813; 113-756-265-658-05X; 115-362-694-789-411; 115-830-728-532-142; 115-962-520-020-636; 117-595-144-173-807; 117-988-761-272-189; 120-743-615-928-349; 121-692-780-793-846; 123-413-478-565-429; 124-229-501-413-383; 125-752-607-193-924; 127-207-783-508-023; 127-453-406-774-151; 129-031-891-944-89X; 130-876-592-820-264; 131-201-234-130-563; 133-062-025-614-647; 134-330-632-476-201; 137-417-499-050-869; 137-537-032-167-154; 138-155-384-325-219; 140-003-432-827-301; 140-947-679-897-406; 141-779-615-430-061; 141-901-222-242-592; 142-558-363-458-259; 143-152-433-421-184; 146-149-601-808-92X; 148-963-699-927-474; 153-007-468-551-706; 155-615-432-207-956; 156-987-810-060-757; 157-165-666-735-791; 157-562-281-143-911; 160-100-417-919-961; 162-603-698-743-727; 164-509-199-251-893; 165-504-597-351-359; 165-828-850-738-030; 165-841-199-671-741; 166-355-657-666-45X; 166-398-070-908-368; 167-660-998-729-049; 169-269-951-035-278; 172-573-079-472-196; 172-999-637-082-271; 173-103-353-695-908; 173-893-282-179-736; 176-667-723-051-951; 176-925-051-081-371; 177-049-087-928-203; 177-173-383-232-09X; 177-347-886-422-503; 178-928-591-197-435; 182-615-753-599-187; 183-664-216-574-934; 185-122-868-787-982; 185-148-560-931-082; 187-986-177-650-232; 190-032-872-808-100; 191-380-857-200-911; 191-519-140-458-791; 192-465-811-777-351; 192-965-728-846-396; 193-342-284-685-047; 193-920-033-952-376; 194-355-556-837-243; 194-711-988-215-075; 195-269-139-186-377; 195-655-868-973-202; 196-817-158-774-095; 198-108-818-551-526,5

It challenges an implicit assumption in much psychological theory and research that creativity exists as an ‘objective’ feature of persons or products, universally recognised and independent of social agreement and cultural systems of norms and beliefs. Focusing on everyday life creative outcomes, the article includes both theoretical accounts and empirical examples from a research exploring creativity evaluations in the context of folk art. In the end, a multi-layered perspective of creativity assessment emerges, integrating dimensions such as newness and originality, value and usefulness, subjective reception and cultural reception of creative products.

The application deals with the design of shop window displays where products should be arranged by teams of vocational students according to aesthetic principles (attributes). </jats:p><jats:p> The photos of the students’ window displays at time 1 (before feedback) and at time 2 (after feedback) were compared by judging each attribute as to whether it was fulfilled better at time 1 or at time 2. An advantage of this PC approach over an alternative of a scoring system is the possibility to assess even subtle changes of various aspects of attractiveness, which cannot easily be measured using a score. To analyse these data, we used earlier work which developed both a multivariate PC pattern model for multi-attribute data and a PC model over time and defined a multivariate PC model of changes (MPCC). The model can be fitted as a non-standard Poisson log-linear model and provides estimates of change for the three attributes for time 2 and we were able to check for possible interaction effects between these attributes. </jats:p>",,,1471082X2199567,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1471082x21995675,,10.1177/1471082x21995675,,,0,000-502-098-255-116; 003-167-463-947-22X; 008-459-485-036-837; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-884-540-656-351; 027-659-055-354-785; 031-057-896-393-179; 041-706-379-743-767; 044-543-500-382-496; 065-660-082-837-308; 077-723-942-563-345; 086-243-451-818-087; 122-376-674-983-517,0

Tenderness and juiciness scores were greater at 55°C than at 74°C, irrespective of the animal type and location of the panel. The UK panel, independently of animal type, gave greater scores for beef flavour (+7 to +24%, P<0.001) but lower scores for abnormal flavour (-10 to -17%, P<0.001) at 74°C. Abnormal flavour score by the French panel was higher at 74°C than at 55°C (+26%, P<0.001). Irrespective of the data set, tenderness was correlated with juiciness and beef flavour. Overall, this study found that cooking beef at a lower temperature increased tenderness and juiciness, irrespective of the location of the panel. In contrast, cooking beef at higher temperatures increased beef flavour and decreased abnormal flavour for the UK panelists but increased abnormal flavour for the French panel.",122,,90,96,Flavour; Red meat; Tenderness; Inter-laboratory; End point; Food handling; Lower temperature; Food science; Medicine,Beef; End-point cooking temperature; Meat sensory qualities; Sensory protocol,Animals; Cattle; Cooking/methods; Female; Food Handling; Food Preferences; France; Humans; Male; Red Meat/analysis; Sensation; Taste; Temperature; United Kingdom,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/160106386 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/inter-laboratory-assessment-by-trained-panelists-from-france-and- https://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2160/43912 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/138599126/FranceQuality.pdf https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/inter-laboratory-assessment-by-trained-panelists-from-france-and- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016302455 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/87903160/Revised_Paper_Gagaoua_MEATSCI.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501233 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016302455 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/72001542.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.07.026,27501233,10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.07.026,2489516506,,0,000-070-360-855-349; 001-936-067-143-888; 002-101-337-944-10X; 002-633-852-786-801; 002-892-200-414-689; 003-358-956-198-476; 003-427-218-567-993; 004-645-203-424-828; 008-854-536-921-183; 013-175-024-768-724; 015-642-721-782-743; 017-008-357-805-930; 019-497-506-701-899; 019-906-797-934-012; 021-232-218-398-782; 023-880-688-651-701; 024-239-743-118-065; 026-313-348-619-033; 027-425-178-927-772; 029-378-081-124-205; 031-184-080-698-043; 033-202-898-508-073; 034-418-444-027-346; 036-078-028-967-165; 037-171-276-258-491; 037-447-082-427-490; 039-025-402-975-035; 041-237-494-993-471; 041-480-064-991-417; 042-340-123-057-133; 043-035-110-451-137; 046-369-437-243-777; 050-162-774-958-171; 050-543-876-353-551; 054-182-799-859-595; 055-028-633-922-030; 057-068-638-436-540; 059-344-241-946-690; 060-977-853-140-28X; 061-342-329-165-218; 062-498-246-071-678; 063-523-161-784-634; 069-779-215-217-801; 070-101-591-821-427; 071-719-529-948-161; 074-330-277-890-592; 077-179-757-482-715; 077-971-300-393-076; 081-532-912-606-36X; 082-589-964-013-922; 083-556-345-149-80X; 085-317-394-317-421; 085-878-345-888-789; 092-690-540-998-595; 097-446-686-307-467; 097-912-294-231-075; 103-949-710-619-744; 109-476-908-419-263; 115-675-751-590-503; 124-847-680-635-982; 129-189-934-321-044; 137-726-816-936-583; 171-478-896-801-189,24

In these experiments, discrimination sensitivity depends on the temporal order of these stimuli (Type B effect) and is usually higher when the standard precedes rather than follows the comparison. Here, we outline how two models of stimulus discrimination can account for the Type B effect, namely the weighted difference model (or basic Sensation Weighting model) and the Internal Reference Model. For both models, the predicted psychometric functions for comparative judgements as well as for equality judgements, in which participants indicate whether they perceived the two stimuli to be equal or not equal, are derived and it is shown that the models also predict a Type B effect for equality judgements. In the empirical part, the models' predictions are evaluated.

Attridge,"The standard RGB (sRGB) colour space was developed to ensure accurate colour reproduction of images when viewed on Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) displays under specified conditions. Typical display and viewing conditions may vary, however, especially when accessing on-line images. Previous work has been carried out on the effects of different display white points and phosphor chromaticities and on modeling gamma tolerances and display conditions for the sRGB colour space. The work described in this paper investigates the effects of different gamma values on viewing sRGB images. ; Ten images with variable scene content were selected and converted to the sRGB colour space. A set of test images was generated for each scene by adjusting the display gamma of the sRGB image to a value in the range 1.8 to 2.6. Comparative judgments were conducted in which the reference sRGB image (calibrated for displays with gamma equal to 2.2) in each set was compared to each of the images adjusted to different display gammas. Each pair of images was displayed on the same monitor using software specially developed for the purpose. ; ; In the first series, the observers' responses concerned the perceptible difference between the reference sRGB image and the images calibrated to the different gamma value. In the second test their response concerned the acceptable gamma difference. The experimental results were evaluated and discussed. Conclusions were drawn regarding the effects of gamma differences on perceived image quality while viewing on-line sRGB images.",,,120,125,Computer graphics (images); Artificial intelligence; Gamma correction; Geography; Software; sRGB; Computer vision; Cathode ray tube; Image quality; RGB color model,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pics/pics2003.html#BilissiJA03 https://westminsterresearch.westminster.ac.uk/item/936x4/perceptibility-and-acceptability-of-gamma-differences-of-displayed-srgb-images,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pics/pics2003.html#BilissiJA03,,,1504070399,,0,064-495-335-186-759; 072-669-501-204-586; 109-975-626-463-692; 166-585-827-428-918; 195-749-076-500-797,1

Although a lot of attention has been devoted to understanding the processes that underlie complex moral dilemmas, attempts to represent the way in which individuals generate moral judgments when processing basic harmful actions are rare. Here, we will outline a model of morality which proposes that the evaluation of basic harmful actions relies on complex interactions between emotional arousal, Theory of Mind (ToM) capacities, and inhibitory control resources. This model makes clear predictions regarding the cognitive processes underlying the development of and ability to generate moral judgments. We draw on data from developmental and cognitive psychology, cognitive neuroscience, and psychopathology research to evaluate the model and propose several conceptual and methodological improvements that are needed to further advance our understanding of moral cognition and its development.",23,6,1660,1680,Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Cognitive science; Morality; Social cognitive theory of morality; Theory of mind; Moral disengagement; Moral development; Social cognition,Causation; Dual processes model; Empathy; Inhibitory control; Intention; Morality; Theory of mind,"Arousal/physiology; Emotions/physiology; Executive Function/physiology; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; Morals; Social Perception; Theory of Mind/physiology; Thinking/physiology",,Fyssen Fundation; Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia; Royal Society Wolfson Research Merit Award holder,https://www.scinapse.io/papers/2389783004 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5133272 https://paperity.org/p/76108088/why-and-how-should-we-study-the-interplay-between-emotional-arousal-theory-of-mind-and https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493582/ https://core.ac.uk/display/81761415 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27169411/ http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1493582/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-02916590 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13423-016-1042-5.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-016-1042-5 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5133272 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81761415.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-016-1042-5,27169411,10.3758/s13423-016-1042-5,2389783004,PMC5133272,0,001-234-274-706-077; 001-625-661-019-101; 002-143-887-931-536; 003-199-654-438-045; 003-365-363-916-239; 003-396-987-891-81X; 005-890-762-415-181; 005-917-902-628-558; 006-254-468-364-597; 007-408-940-996-21X; 008-015-901-909-880; 009-605-877-180-861; 009-799-038-677-314; 010-635-117-354-470; 011-192-948-082-716; 011-522-443-951-815; 011-809-033-555-367; 013-100-915-521-104; 013-459-386-856-371; 014-141-459-026-640; 015-339-625-072-707; 015-393-472-335-250; 015-443-992-008-635; 015-800-895-652-253; 015-868-207-837-088; 016-540-198-287-738; 017-894-312-367-315; 018-095-538-225-593; 018-347-300-569-415; 018-590-780-058-912; 018-736-025-711-649; 019-147-897-265-480; 019-528-497-970-702; 020-295-524-379-098; 021-034-170-816-289; 021-036-293-179-258; 021-486-282-503-17X; 021-610-552-617-982; 021-766-245-409-113; 021-871-703-378-022; 022-190-470-679-600; 022-757-864-355-793; 023-181-512-534-154; 023-674-675-503-008; 024-841-406-073-494; 025-894-331-933-802; 028-960-078-749-391; 029-051-219-964-940; 029-505-814-693-325; 030-056-169-410-963; 030-242-164-689-298; 031-360-312-267-753; 031-555-483-404-695; 034-814-302-781-700; 036-489-755-767-764; 037-371-953-516-133; 038-479-931-395-650; 039-528-789-235-641; 040-179-900-330-624; 040-849-062-097-025; 042-119-769-551-293; 042-197-148-666-50X; 043-941-758-583-890; 045-463-500-781-91X; 045-872-647-851-393; 046-635-343-848-627; 047-171-711-633-261; 047-534-938-033-463; 049-102-954-921-78X; 049-204-354-255-397; 050-454-184-090-004; 050-576-818-775-810; 051-943-404-847-173; 052-034-593-558-589; 052-604-134-984-273; 052-757-262-441-051; 053-030-145-885-437; 053-379-296-535-866; 054-247-694-391-310; 057-196-216-752-056; 057-742-487-489-881; 060-585-185-755-816; 063-758-363-904-020; 066-363-689-839-356; 067-126-715-729-765; 069-052-323-432-608; 069-577-810-767-220; 071-271-475-878-619; 072-061-033-570-183; 074-442-662-682-366; 075-759-576-085-938; 078-192-422-999-686; 078-802-732-716-640; 079-192-095-475-653; 088-020-146-483-780; 090-088-793-987-355; 090-166-081-826-773; 090-346-903-248-414; 091-158-811-094-727; 092-431-291-551-939; 094-190-410-983-311; 097-062-968-843-046; 099-117-336-979-082; 100-496-419-979-500; 101-715-965-097-20X; 102-077-104-153-92X; 105-087-114-620-796; 110-061-697-552-363; 111-665-984-769-825; 113-163-536-381-029; 116-383-347-781-289; 116-415-109-727-862; 116-844-490-035-86X; 119-587-674-224-205; 119-651-798-925-509; 120-677-434-783-598; 122-078-932-030-810; 126-467-878-264-994; 128-418-793-693-361; 129-673-980-415-169; 129-837-744-072-49X; 133-120-438-907-854; 134-085-450-759-810; 143-948-959-265-829; 154-361-372-418-773; 154-993-508-919-012; 155-777-987-631-875; 159-266-681-510-983; 162-644-185-739-600; 163-346-044-565-53X; 181-084-676-761-390; 197-388-700-923-630,40
010-743-155-290-55X,Five go marking an exam question: the use of Adaptive Comparative Judgement to manage subjective bias,2018-04-30,2018,,,,,,Jill Barber,"Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) is an alternative to conventional marking in which the assessor (judge) merely compares two answers and chooses a winner. (Scripts are typically uploaded to the CompareAssess interface as pdf files and are presented side-by-side.) Repeated comparisons and application of the sorting algorithm leads to scripts sorted in order of merit. Boundaries are determined by separate review of scripts.; A small pilot of ACJ in the fourth year of the Manchester Pharmacy programme is described. Twelve judges used ACJ to mark 64 scripts previously marked conventionally. 50 students peer-marked their own mock examination question using ACJ.; Peer-marking was successful with students learning from the process, and delivering both marks and feedback within two weeks. There was very good consistency among the students acting as judges, and accuracy (as defined by Pollitt, 2012) of 0.94.; Staff were similarly consistent, but the agreement with marks obtained by conventional marking was disappointing. While some discrepancies could be attributed to conventional marking failing under the stress of marking during teaching term, the worst discrepancies appeared to originate from inadequate judging criteria.  ; We conclude that ACJ is a very promising method, especially for peer assessment, but that judging criteria require very careful consideration.",11,1,94,100,Sorting algorithm; Summative assessment; Adaptive comparative judgement; Value judgment; Alternative assessment; Student learning; Computer science; Peer assessment; Scripting language; Applied psychology,,,,,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/download/465/583 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1180133.pdf https://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/465 http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1180133.pdf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1180133,https://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/465,,,2891993228,,0,,1

In policy analysis settings, relative weights for policy alternatives are subjectively assessed by a group of experts or stakeholders via surveys using comparative judgment. A hierarchical pairwise comparison process is developed to help make comparative judgment among a large number of alternatives with fuzzy ratio values. Performance ratings for policy alter- natives are obtained from objective measurement or subjective judgement. The preference value of an expert on a policy alternative is obtained by multiplying the weight of the alternative by its performance rating. Two optimization models are developed to determine the optimal weights that maximize the overall preference value of all experts or stakeholders.

Shah; Kannan Ramchandran; Martin J. Wainwright,"We consider sequential or active ranking of a set of $n$ items based on noisy pairwise comparisons. Items are ranked according to the probability that a given item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the items into sets of prespecified sizes according to their scores. This notion of ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-$k$ items and the total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to decide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on confidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove that this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of comparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does depend on whether or not the underlying pairwise probability matrix, satisfies a particular structural property, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on parametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley–Terry–Luce models. It has been a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these parametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic comparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from zero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound for parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular parametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic comparisons.",47,6,3099,3126,Statistics; Parametric statistics; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Parametric model; Mathematics; Bounded function; Stochastic matrix; Upper and lower bounds; Learning to rank,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160608842H/abstract https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1572487385,http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/18-aos1772,,10.1214/18-aos1772,2982366565,,0,,15

I argue that the force of the charge is mitigated, because non-naturalism is ultimately committed to a kind of mysterianism about the metaphysics of practical norms that possesses limited explanatory power. I then show that focusing on comparative judgments about the explanatory power of various metaethical theories raises additional problems for the non-naturalist, and suggest grounds for optimism that a naturalistic realist about practical normativity will ultimately be able to explain the distinctive normativity of practical norms. I then show that radical pluralism or particularism about the structure of normative ethics would complicate the naturalistic strategy that I defend.

Teodorescu,"We present a model-based analysis of two-alternative forced-choice tasks in which two stimuli are presented side by side and subjects must make a comparative judgment (e.g., which stimulus is brighter). Stimuli can vary on two dimensions, the difference in strength of the two stimuli and the magnitude of each stimulus. Differences between the two stimuli produce typical RT and accuracy effects (i.e., subjects respond more quickly and more accurately when there is a larger difference between the two). However, the overall magnitude of the pair of stimuli also affects RT and accuracy. In the more common two-choice task, a single stimulus is presented and the stimulus varies on only one dimension. In this two-stimulus task, if the standard diffusion decision model is fit to the data with only drift rate (evidence accumulation rate) differing among conditions, the model cannot fit the data. However, if either of one of two variability parameters is allowed to change with stimulus magnitude, the model can fit the data. This results in two models that are extremely constrained with about one tenth of the number of parameters than there are data points while at the same time the models account for accuracy and correct and error RT distributions. While both of these versions of the diffusion model can account for the observed data, the model that allows across-trial variability in drift to vary might be preferred for theoretical reasons. The diffusion model fits are compared to the leaky competing accumulator model which did not perform as well.",103,,1,22,Two-alternative forced choice; Algorithm; Diffusion (business); Stimulus (physiology); Data point; Mathematics; Stochastic drift; Decision model; Magnitude (mathematics); Accumulator (structured product),2AFC task; Diffusion model; LCA; Response time models,"Adult; Choice Behavior/physiology; Humans; Models, Psychological; Reaction Time/physiology; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult",,NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG041176) United States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29501775/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001002851830032X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5911219,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cogpsych.2018.02.002,29501775,10.1016/j.cogpsych.2018.02.002,2792927277,PMC5911219,0,004-165-239-429-599; 009-380-689-254-718; 010-138-894-901-355; 013-816-318-204-972; 017-086-729-253-510; 021-422-272-100-446; 022-513-574-133-227; 023-385-252-947-108; 026-597-044-318-677; 030-258-526-131-58X; 032-905-474-283-59X; 035-764-593-157-53X; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-265-949-465-370; 040-600-568-061-974; 043-109-652-575-395; 047-326-627-677-548; 048-010-744-097-097; 048-384-203-814-803; 049-066-005-643-727; 049-695-710-300-668; 052-997-690-742-70X; 056-921-947-185-430; 057-534-952-228-024; 059-259-269-704-013; 061-214-352-934-509; 062-026-402-059-73X; 063-688-050-426-59X; 070-430-641-389-546; 071-670-698-276-875; 074-017-562-218-104; 078-517-923-951-675; 078-802-980-996-602; 084-791-257-849-394; 090-182-186-756-679; 091-325-126-280-754; 094-764-308-152-028; 098-816-659-637-251; 103-224-217-295-282; 105-514-559-560-136; 117-871-943-941-41X; 118-744-169-325-523; 143-732-960-054-241,17

DeWind; Geoffrey K. Adams; Michael L. Platt; Elizabeth M. Brannon,"The approximate number system (ANS) subserves estimation of the number of items in a set. Typically, ANS function is assessed by requiring participants to compare the number of dots in two arrays. Accuracy is determined by the numerical ratio of the sets being compared, and each participant’s Weber fraction (w) provides a quantitative index of ANS acuity. When making numerical comparisons, however, performance is also influenced by non-numerical features of the stimuli, such as the size and spacing of dots. Current models of numerosity comparison do not account for these effects and consequently lead to different estimates of w depending on the methods used to control for non-numerical features. Here we proffer a new model that teases apart the effects of ANS acuity from the effects of non-numerical stimulus features. The result is an estimate of w that is a more theoretically valid representation of numerical acuity and novel terms that denote the degree to which a participant’s perception of number is affected by non-numerical features. We tested this model in a sample of 20 adults and found that, by correctly attributing errors due to non-numerical stimulus features, the w obtained was more reliable across different stimulus conditions. We found that although non-numerical features biased numerosity discriminations in all participants, number was the primary feature driving discriminations in most of them. Our findings support the idea that, while numerosity is a distinct visual quantity, the internal representation of number is tightly bound to the representation of other magnitudes. This tool for identifying the different effects of the numerical and non-numerical features of a stimulus has important implications not only for the behavioral investigation of the ANS, but also for the collection and analyses of neural data sets associated with ANS function.",142,,247,265,Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Number sense; Pattern recognition; Perception; Approximate number system; Numerical cognition; Data set; Social psychology,Approximate number system; Magnitude comparison; Number sense; Numerical cognition; Psychophysics,"Adult; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematics; Models, Psychological; Photic Stimulation; Young Adult",,NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY019303) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM008441) United States; NEI NIH HHS (1R01EY019303) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027715001134 https://core.ac.uk/display/82038274 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4831213 https://philpapers.org/rec/DEWMTA-2 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82038274.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2015.05.016,26056747,10.1016/j.cognition.2015.05.016,639002133,PMC4831213,0,000-490-713-895-241; 002-743-317-587-306; 002-996-519-028-663; 003-146-829-638-518; 004-030-636-268-081; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-548-790-016-05X; 007-402-735-113-601; 007-926-410-139-923; 008-423-594-939-432; 009-802-020-591-568; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-035-527-353-329; 020-720-404-905-270; 020-997-963-038-216; 024-311-244-236-511; 024-771-840-903-744; 026-617-630-691-234; 026-801-611-514-937; 026-904-446-310-931; 028-829-546-351-912; 031-191-749-173-51X; 031-316-795-276-233; 031-775-566-626-423; 035-402-974-768-248; 036-302-964-021-739; 037-436-823-090-386; 038-395-026-012-885; 039-555-369-773-746; 039-866-525-488-655; 042-366-406-891-692; 042-793-844-821-092; 043-288-458-558-686; 043-702-379-216-902; 045-441-908-859-736; 047-440-067-968-409; 048-072-183-050-822; 049-816-140-612-501; 051-839-955-755-136; 052-274-814-673-883; 055-643-503-860-593; 057-877-558-474-926; 058-213-217-734-122; 061-359-161-318-874; 062-214-173-891-992; 062-451-178-082-026; 069-521-385-478-387; 069-586-547-920-957; 072-498-336-478-394; 072-849-353-462-759; 076-179-561-577-812; 077-955-155-009-954; 083-680-277-916-656; 084-855-139-921-658; 085-297-224-208-913; 086-866-171-771-342; 090-991-808-447-687; 092-568-831-144-646; 093-914-548-851-797; 096-507-969-290-685; 097-933-480-117-519; 098-961-359-300-586; 102-755-968-592-356; 103-845-729-221-30X; 110-515-136-291-304; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-204-913-104-353; 124-987-119-273-327; 134-987-147-316-42X; 141-841-208-492-42X; 152-851-921-965-411,96

Reddy; R. Adams; Cathal Walsh; M. Barry; Paul Kind,"Abstract Background The EuroQol five-dimensional questionnaire is a standardized instrument used in the economic evaluation of health care to measure health state preferences across disease groups. A time trade-off (TTO) approach is commonly used to elicit preferences from the public. However, there are issues regarding how best to measure worse-than-dead states; at present, extreme valuations are rounded up to more acceptable values. TTO elicitation is also cognitively demanding for respondents and is therefore expensive to investigate. Objectives To describe how the analytic hierarchy process approach could be used to generate utilities from the ordinal relationships between the health states instead of the ordinal relationships between health states, allowing potentially useful preference data to be incorporated rather than excluded as they are at present. It was applied to the Measurement and Valuation of Health study data set, measuring health state preferences for the United Kingdom. Methods The analytic hierarchy process approach was explained. Five approaches to structure pairwise comparisons of health state preference were described (two concave, two convex, and one linear). Results All approaches described predicted the rankings of health states well. However, utilities derived followed an unconventional, bunched shape compared with the original Measurement and Valuation of Health TTO study. An approach was identified by optimizing the parameters, minimizing the sum of squared errors between the ordinal ""health state ranking"" approach and the original TTO-derived utilities. Conclusions This approach outlined offers the potential to convert ordinal preference data into cardinal utilities. It is simpler than TTO studies to carry out and removes the need to directly alter results of the preference ranking exercise.",18,6,841,845,Econometrics; Health care; Actuarial science; Economics; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Economic evaluation; EQ-5D; Health services research; Ordinal number; Analytic hierarchy process,EQ-5D; analytic hierarchy process; health state valuation; utilities,Decision Support Techniques; Health Services Research/methods; Health Status; Health Status Indicators; Humans; Linear Models; Logistic Models; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Surveys and Questionnaires; United Kingdom,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26409612 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26409612 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301515020483 https://core.ac.uk/display/82459287 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301515020483 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82459287.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.010,26409612,10.1016/j.jval.2015.05.010,2149347417,,0,006-815-385-489-463; 020-869-792-463-958; 022-298-013-803-623; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-784-682-767-502; 038-326-629-841-632; 044-268-654-736-388; 046-686-497-941-664; 059-404-770-221-144; 098-729-868-064-992; 125-513-366-485-249; 130-487-681-607-618; 148-402-069-524-419; 158-478-852-505-571; 177-995-278-479-915,3

Baranski; William M. Petrusic,"Abstract Two experiments examined the effect of rendering confidence judgments on the properties of the comparative decision process. In Experiment 1, participants worked for 12 sessions that required two-alternative perceptual, line-length comparisons. For sessions 1-4 and sessions 9-12, confidence judgments were not required. For sessions 5-8, participants provided confidence reports following each comparative judgment. The requirement of confidence judgments significantly increased decisional response time, suggesting that some confidence processing occurs in parallel with the primary decision process. Concomitantly, an examination of the properties of the time to determine confidence during sessions 5-8 revealed clear evidence of postdecisional confidence processing. These results were replicated in a second experiment requiring twoalternative comparative judgments of Canadian city populations. We conclude that confidence processing occurs both during the decision process and postdecisionally, and we discuss the implications of the present findings for current theories of confidence in human judgment. In both recent and classical studies of confidence in human judgment, the participant is required first to make a decision and then to provide a confidence report that reflects the degree of certainty with which the decision was made. Importantly, although the temporal sequence of events (i.e., decision-then-confidence) necessitates that the judgment of confidence is articulated postdecisionally, it is not altogether necessary that the judgment of confidence is determined postdecisionally. In fact, current theories of confidence in human judgment can be clearly distinguished on the basis of their assumed processing locus for the determination of confidence. One class, which we refer to as the single-process theories, assumes that decision and confidence are inextricably tied to the same process (i.e., they assume a decisional-locus for confidence). The other class, which we refer to as the postdecisional theories, assumes that decision and confidence are distinct, serial processes. Empirical inquiry concerning the specific processing locus of confidence judgments has taken two approaches. The first focuses on the properties of the time to determine confidence (i.e., the time to render the judgment of confidence) with a view towards understanding if, and to what extent, confidence processing occurs following the primary decision (Baranski & Petrusic, 1998). The second focuses on whether, and to what extent, the requirement of confidence judgments affects the properties of the primary decision process (Petrusic & Baranski, 2000). In the sequel, we report two experiments that address these issues simultaneously. We first begin with a brief review of alternative theories of confidence in human judgment and illustrate their proposed architectures of the decision-confidence relation. Architectures of the Decision-Confidence Relation SINGLE-PROCESS MODELS Signal detection theory. Perhaps the most well-known and widely applied models of confidence have been those developed in the context of a signal detection framework (e.g., Balakrishnan & Ratcliff, 1996; Bjorkman, Juslin, & Winman, 1993; Ferrell, 1994a, 1994b; Ferrell & McGoey, 1980; Kinchla & Collyer, 1974; Norman & Wickelgren, 1969; Thomas & Hogue, 1976; Treisman & Faulkner, 1984; Wallsten, Bender, & Li, 1999; Wallsten & Gonzalez-Vallejo, 1994). According to this position, confidence is based on a scaling of decision strength: generally, a likelihood partitioning or a direct scaling of the distance between the sampled observation and the decisional criterion (for a review, see Balakrishnan & Ratcliff, 1996).1 Thus, once the partitioning of the strength variable is established, confidence is not determined but rather is simply ""read off"" an internal strength scale.

Yamanaka; Tadamasa Takemura; K. Nin; Hiroyuki Yoshihara,"Objective: Development of a clinical sensor network system that automatically collects vital sign and its supplemental data, and evaluation the effect of automatic vital sensor value assignment to patients based on locations of sensors. Methods: The sensor network estimates the data-source, a target patient, from the position of a vital sign sensor obtained from a newly developed proximity sensing system. The proximity sensing system estimates the positions of the devices using a Bluetooth inquiry process. Using Bluetooth access points and the positioning system newly developed in this project, the sensor network collects vital sign and its 4W (who, where, what, and when) supplemental data from any Bluetooth ready vital sign sensors such as Continua-ready devices. The prototype was evaluated in a pseudo clinical setting at Kyoto University Hospital using a cyclic paired comparison and statistical analysis. Results: The result of the cyclic paired analysis shows the subjects evaluated the proposed system is more effective and safer than POCS as well as paper-based operation. It halves the times for vital signs input and eliminates input errors. On the other hand, the prototype failed in its position estimation for 12.6% of all attempts, and the nurses overlooked half of the errors. A detailed investigation clears that an advanced interface to show the system’s “confidence”, i.e. the probability of estimation error, must be effective to reduce the oversights. Conclusions: This paper proposed a clinical sensor network system that relieves nurses from vital signs input tasks. The result clearly shows that the proposed system increases the efficiency and safety of the nursing process both subjectively and objectively. It is a step toward new generation of point of nursing care systems where sensors take over the tasks of data input from the nurses.",52,3,239,249,Automation; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor network; Vital signs; Positioning system; Context awareness; Nursing care; Computer science; Simulation; Bluetooth; Real-time computing,,"Automation/instrumentation; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Japan; Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Point-of-Care Systems; Vital Signs; Wireless Technology",,,http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.3414/ME12-01-0096 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23591822 http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120005477215 https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.3414/ME12-01-0096.pdf http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/189859/1/ME12-01-0096.pdf https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2433/189859 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23591822 https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.3414/ME12-01-0096 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39314561.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3414/me12-01-0096,23591822,10.3414/me12-01-0096,1661588915,,0,004-774-480-663-545; 006-330-962-678-286; 010-533-602-736-408; 010-991-853-279-510; 014-344-842-620-765; 014-373-513-256-723; 020-456-571-561-671; 020-595-656-415-737; 022-675-338-039-61X; 026-051-520-730-87X; 027-653-962-720-323; 028-347-973-571-23X; 028-848-657-978-930; 033-871-091-417-670; 035-425-069-901-231; 044-779-897-229-182; 046-827-946-359-298; 048-929-612-030-775; 054-111-796-698-185; 058-164-183-569-545; 059-428-557-033-968; 062-805-543-471-018; 063-200-348-257-985; 067-408-399-083-725; 075-520-582-980-993; 080-279-645-436-323; 082-470-678-297-903; 085-183-637-234-25X; 087-461-693-537-423; 087-719-502-382-322; 093-011-280-078-07X; 100-283-012-193-021; 104-421-312-543-706; 117-797-680-918-097; 119-926-010-652-673; 125-288-271-223-969; 133-953-261-212-18X; 142-518-590-650-906; 164-602-897-089-842; 164-616-488-345-777; 168-036-345-097-619; 183-072-639-458-434; 183-921-178-227-660; 187-362-786-592-140,15

Still, much of the hearing world remains unconvinced, and continues to think of deafness in negative terms. I examine this debate and argue that to determine whether it can be good to be deaf it is necessary to examine each claimed advantage or disadvantage of being deaf, and then to make an overall judgment regarding the net cost or benefit. On the basis of such a survey I conclude that being deaf may plausibly be a good thing for some deaf people but not for others.",32,6,563,583,Psychology; Well-being; Disadvantage; Sign language; Audiology; Social psychology,,"Attitude; Communication; Deafness/psychology; Humans; Persons With Hearing Impairments/psychology; Philosophy, Medical; Prejudice",,,https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/54126/ https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/50905/1/cooperdeaf.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18027249 https://academic.oup.com/jmp/article-abstract/32/6/563/891712 http://www.research.lancs.ac.uk/portal/services/downloadRegister/37656535/cooperdeaf.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/03605310701680940 https://core.ac.uk/display/1557359 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1557359.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/03605310701680940,18027249,10.1080/03605310701680940,1972788170,,0,000-143-144-794-021; 000-456-348-758-353; 001-004-281-183-725; 008-002-961-156-304; 025-198-926-951-920; 025-288-480-493-281; 041-277-376-905-393; 047-770-251-897-710; 052-264-047-560-423; 075-185-148-955-888; 087-837-441-400-255; 092-754-229-098-906; 098-687-302-597-404; 103-930-549-350-995; 123-172-936-240-02X; 138-641-856-492-503; 141-898-055-842-00X; 148-527-711-650-455; 151-832-595-777-393; 154-172-415-735-291; 155-939-491-203-016; 162-599-777-919-023; 166-852-601-327-245; 170-405-299-699-354; 175-931-872-414-385; 195-845-362-848-057; 197-081-547-567-433,21

Dagsvik; Steinar Strøm; Zhiyang Jia,"The paper proposes a particular approach to model the utility of income. We develop a theoretical framework that restricts the class of admissible functional forms and distributions of the random components of the model. The theoretical approach is based on theories of probabilistic choice and ideas that are used in modern psychophysical research. From our theoretical framework, we obtain the empirical model and the corresponding likelihood function. The empirical analysis is based on a “Stated Preference” survey. The model fits the data quite well.

By distinguishing perceived ability from actual ability and using theoretical underpinnings from the human capital theory and self-efficacy theory, the proposed hypotheses are tested on a data set comprising respondents from the adult population. Design/methodology/approach – Using 20,046 observations from the adult population survey (APS) collected according to the global entrepreneurship monitor (GEM) methodology, a logistic regression analysis controlling for robust interaction term is used to determine the direct and interaction effect of perceived entrepreneurial ability and actual ability in influencing the decision to initiate nascent entrepreneurial activities. Findings – The results reveal that perceived entrepreneurial ability has a distinct positive influence on the decision to initiate en...",21,1,27,49,Self-efficacy; Logistic regression; Psychology; Perception; Start up; Human capital theory; Adult population; Social psychology; Entrepreneurship; Interaction,,,,,http://upcommons.upc.edu/bitstream/handle/2117/27454/2015_IJEBR_Bayon+Vaillant+Lafuente.pdf?sequence=1 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJEBR-11-2013-0201/full/html https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/27454 https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/10.1108/IJEBR-11-2013-0201 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/IJEBR-11-2013-0201/full/pdf?title=initiating-nascent-entrepreneurial-activities-the-relative-role-of-perceived-and-actual-entrepreneurial-ability,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/ijebr-11-2013-0201,,10.1108/ijebr-11-2013-0201,1605578248,,0,002-472-122-355-052; 003-258-105-238-013; 003-622-390-033-321; 004-130-251-802-288; 005-586-528-293-220; 006-544-875-692-577; 006-668-147-064-980; 007-110-359-188-700; 009-299-623-546-736; 010-028-239-713-14X; 012-411-326-427-867; 012-649-121-140-627; 014-419-655-760-168; 016-647-879-582-53X; 016-656-845-755-417; 019-074-839-599-314; 019-109-582-279-995; 019-461-678-683-549; 020-466-746-902-415; 021-203-850-665-722; 023-639-356-479-473; 025-497-884-027-106; 025-650-561-476-773; 026-838-010-450-762; 028-279-490-002-620; 031-421-838-677-34X; 031-749-333-348-064; 032-366-190-417-138; 032-406-231-930-389; 035-069-792-527-930; 036-649-024-056-395; 037-408-156-756-253; 038-017-229-313-25X; 038-880-940-713-404; 039-411-380-647-57X; 039-497-114-901-408; 042-100-825-331-093; 044-012-787-552-698; 044-801-842-218-660; 049-019-578-590-413; 050-119-397-343-775; 050-640-312-763-912; 050-914-852-316-377; 052-668-709-106-635; 055-070-798-326-463; 055-490-098-917-714; 055-847-427-959-093; 056-979-804-290-796; 062-680-571-577-569; 063-490-366-585-534; 071-117-880-920-360; 073-861-536-870-577; 080-770-475-707-302; 083-030-442-043-242; 083-523-434-059-493; 084-785-784-094-498; 087-947-492-346-989; 088-961-983-365-700; 096-663-494-174-174; 096-747-285-355-364; 096-963-890-282-69X; 098-455-061-093-439; 099-352-014-995-776; 100-450-913-075-423; 100-678-034-448-730; 101-029-630-378-237; 106-323-702-431-797; 106-762-682-611-604; 109-004-294-019-162; 109-518-641-591-090; 111-593-605-490-841; 113-572-836-411-477; 113-662-231-105-687; 116-647-887-090-012; 118-629-757-350-959; 122-030-234-156-43X; 123-127-858-571-591; 123-363-851-487-594; 124-048-583-242-107; 129-505-110-620-588; 130-538-468-865-658; 130-763-790-078-450; 139-097-641-460-985; 139-224-354-884-899; 145-290-071-504-174; 145-745-917-685-684; 156-423-990-605-377; 158-869-297-928-492; 168-238-956-867-518; 168-368-092-039-031; 175-256-049-446-78X; 175-709-068-988-778; 181-423-591-616-198; 182-381-868-772-550; 194-300-876-184-108; 194-483-722-439-950; 197-137-698-286-84X,35

Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coefficient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coefficient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and find evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of games",,,,,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39383759.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1920/wp.cem.2010.1010,,10.1920/wp.cem.2010.1010,,,0,,0

Exploiting comparative judgments to measure and visualize implicit and explicit preferences.,2018-01-19,2018,journal article,PloS one,19326203,Public Library of Science,United States,Tom Everaert; Adriaan Spruyt; Jan De Houwer,"We introduce an adaptation of the affect misattribution procedure (AMP), called the implicit preference scale (IMPRES). Participants who complete the IMPRES indicate their preference for one of two, simultaneously presented Chinese ideographs. Each ideograph is preceded by a briefly presented prime stimulus that is irrelevant to the task. Participants are hypothesized to prefer the ideograph that is preceded by the prime they prefer. In the present research, the IMPRES was designed to capture racial attitudes (preferences for white versus black faces) and age-related attitudes (preferences for young versus old faces). Results suggest that (a) the reliability of the IMPRES is similar (or even better) than the reliability of the AMP and (b) that the IMPRES and the AMP correlate significantly. However, neither the AMP nor the IMPRES were found to predict attitude-related outcome behavior (i.e., the preparedness to donate money to a charity benefiting ethnic minorities vs. the elderly). Further research is thus necessary to establish the validity of the IMPRES. Finally, we demonstrated that, unlike the AMP, the IMPRES allows for an in-depth assessment of unanticipated response patterns and/or extreme observations using multidimensional scaling algorithms.",13,1,1,14,Misattribution of memory; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Prime (order theory); Ideograph; Association test; Multidimensional scaling,,Attitude; Behavior; Face; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Racism/psychology; Young Adult,,Ghent University,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8545308 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8545308/file/8545344.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/plo/pone00/0191302.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29351345 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018PLoSO..1391302E/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/147103224,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0191302,29351345,10.1371/journal.pone.0191302,2793035949,PMC5774779,0,009-553-347-113-248; 019-696-908-489-124; 023-328-389-485-804; 023-755-358-544-118; 035-440-037-991-100; 039-485-294-683-349; 054-161-103-093-366; 059-848-030-672-684; 060-138-466-652-413; 065-035-103-001-582; 068-344-657-871-377; 069-176-334-441-838; 072-908-249-995-800; 073-404-212-375-517; 075-169-950-782-320; 080-506-380-749-822; 081-599-305-167-47X; 084-145-908-054-098; 135-475-105-545-141,0

Cheng; James A. M. McHugh; Fadi P. Deek,Polling opinion is a common group activity. Scaling tools can be used to provide a more precise presentation of opinions than traditional polling/voting. The interval scale of items constructed by scaling tools can aid participants in finding the current disposition of a group. We consider Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment as well as a weighted digraph ranking system for building group scales from pairwise comparisons. Assumptions for computing scales are reviewed together with issues and limitations of applying these scaling methods in groups. Results from a classic experiment and simulations by both methods are compared. We also made recommendations on choosing scaling method based on theoretic and practical consideration.,22,3,519,540,Data mining; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Polling; Digraph; Mathematics; Voting; Theoretical computer science; Scaling,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/grdene/v22y2013i3d10.1007_s10726-011-9281-3.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10726-011-9281-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10726-011-9281-3,,10.1007/s10726-011-9281-3,1988854437,,0,006-669-666-543-451; 008-255-714-556-875; 011-105-391-999-886; 016-926-000-460-104; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-353-778-316-338; 020-086-418-691-714; 030-763-675-523-357; 031-511-363-912-99X; 035-776-610-863-582; 045-457-272-610-893; 047-753-129-763-554; 053-013-161-124-633; 062-546-879-061-051; 065-906-991-595-286; 066-164-857-800-601; 066-243-406-052-814; 066-465-490-355-992; 080-505-343-020-78X; 082-210-147-602-111; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-082-540-347-879; 091-666-780-893-50X; 099-399-791-704-994; 101-685-732-379-367; 113-079-030-498-041; 113-278-954-446-219; 121-161-560-636-803; 125-364-408-405-360; 139-679-021-329-089; 166-585-827-428-918; 176-568-103-111-526; 177-469-549-220-404; 186-717-528-058-90X,1

Chambers; Paul D. Windschitl,"Biases in social comparative judgments, such as those illustrated by above-average and comparative-optimism effects, are often regarded as products of motivated reasoning (e.g., self-enhancement). These effects, however, can also be produced by information-processing limitations or aspects of judgment processes that are not necessarily biased by motivational factors. In this article, the authors briefly review motivational accounts of biased comparative judgments, introduce a 3-stage model for understanding how people make comparative judgments, and then describe how various nonmotivational factors can influence the 3 stages of the comparative judgment process. Finally, the authors discuss several unresolved issues highlighted by their analysis, such as the interrelation between motivated and nonmotivated sources of bias and the influence of nonmotivated sources of bias on behavior.",130,5,813,838,Psychology; Social comparison theory; Cognitive bias; Optimism; Motivated reasoning; Value judgment; Social value orientations; Illusory superiority; Social psychology; Social cognition,,Affect; Humans; Judgment; Motivation; Self Concept,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15367082 https://www.sid.ir/En/Journal/ViewPaper.aspx?ID=173055 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Chambers3/publication/8347820_Biases_in_Social_Comparative_Judgments_The_Role_of_Nonmotivated_Factors_in_Above-Average_and_Comparative-Optimism_Effects/links/0fcfd50c1f6ecc2c7a000000.pdf http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/biases_in_social_comparative_judgments-_the_role_of_nonmotivated_factors_in_above-average_and_comparative-optimism_effects.pdf http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.813 https://psychology.uiowa.edu/files/psychology/groups/windschitl/files/PB%202004%20%28CW%29.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0033-2909.130.5.813 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ688517 http://johnchambersslu.weebly.com/uploads/2/4/8/5/24852857/chamberswindschitl_psybull_2004.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.813,15367082,10.1037/0033-2909.130.5.813,2033377303,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 002-043-931-530-695; 002-985-457-157-502; 003-498-762-032-886; 004-552-348-993-05X; 004-949-838-366-871; 004-973-672-789-347; 005-485-876-843-169; 007-613-518-980-709; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-002-961-156-304; 008-077-003-420-817; 008-509-482-154-793; 008-723-463-031-98X; 011-213-596-160-505; 011-345-807-363-607; 011-404-001-204-09X; 012-106-262-576-087; 012-355-710-448-108; 015-453-155-175-531; 016-509-402-794-767; 016-982-112-662-591; 017-200-469-077-958; 017-672-929-943-884; 018-792-756-160-664; 019-200-757-553-43X; 019-303-532-604-20X; 019-995-576-553-416; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-341-218-114-789; 022-289-082-354-329; 023-639-356-479-473; 023-814-132-511-185; 023-926-631-266-07X; 024-507-594-489-29X; 024-838-013-412-523; 026-387-449-478-155; 027-186-789-368-775; 027-919-963-140-641; 029-207-492-909-748; 029-642-152-661-797; 029-966-367-465-348; 030-252-574-645-692; 031-672-019-523-79X; 032-104-735-088-638; 033-145-626-985-847; 035-294-134-197-096; 035-442-585-497-153; 036-572-518-181-249; 039-011-812-170-670; 040-269-259-341-705; 040-430-654-992-207; 042-472-795-455-569; 047-753-152-193-406; 048-185-131-961-596; 048-208-720-338-398; 048-924-036-705-953; 048-994-194-229-001; 049-229-125-635-709; 049-288-287-954-665; 054-163-434-118-897; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-426-293-128-753; 056-926-960-371-839; 057-835-652-589-388; 057-900-667-227-636; 060-649-801-063-646; 060-862-867-406-94X; 061-082-122-262-098; 061-142-370-003-855; 061-748-308-588-588; 063-581-732-407-353; 063-828-950-512-030; 064-792-334-491-509; 064-990-488-097-173; 065-541-759-883-380; 065-688-149-501-185; 066-511-998-492-554; 066-756-583-866-169; 067-284-262-830-935; 067-900-979-368-991; 068-086-462-179-074; 071-187-504-333-895; 071-804-955-643-260; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-850-977-359-272; 072-876-017-414-92X; 073-043-961-307-430; 075-137-770-558-667; 075-907-534-938-367; 079-463-629-173-564; 082-662-120-833-072; 085-011-605-076-313; 085-774-844-448-036; 085-882-498-659-946; 088-034-685-565-045; 091-622-417-034-204; 092-534-364-737-788; 092-938-352-555-021; 096-792-630-788-615; 101-474-422-016-915; 102-795-542-679-792; 103-246-940-710-411; 104-155-878-524-214; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 111-153-775-049-777; 114-220-390-756-952; 116-762-136-028-844; 118-426-123-092-29X; 118-952-603-519-168; 120-103-388-707-494; 124-239-164-747-874; 124-656-535-257-223; 130-045-366-355-598; 132-514-809-624-446; 134-172-694-117-502; 134-549-916-860-252; 134-882-499-220-009; 140-397-553-301-28X; 141-776-188-252-411; 143-285-698-170-244; 146-008-745-042-063; 148-223-435-969-407; 150-007-348-151-864; 153-092-071-788-173; 156-695-224-836-175; 158-444-232-588-710; 161-286-724-383-946; 163-569-396-472-394; 166-148-082-833-226; 171-926-624-587-402; 173-036-841-448-44X; 181-166-614-027-51X; 190-086-181-064-265; 190-175-588-170-275; 191-804-585-218-902,433

From a cognitive point of view, however, it is still unclear whether all these experiences rely on a common system, or on distinct systems, with more or less strong associations. One particularly striking way of observing such interference between the spatial and numerical dimensions consists in eliciting a bias in size judgment through the mere perception of irrelevant numerical stimuli. In such experimental context though, two questions remain open. First, it is still unknown whether the direction of the bias is related to the magnitude of the number presented, or to their position in an ordinal sequence, and thus could be elicited by other non-numerical ordinal sequences such as letters of the alphabet. Second, it is still unclear whether the observed interactions generalize to other continuous dimension of magnitude such as brightness. In the study reported here, both letters and numbers were used in a size- and a brightness-reproduction task. We observed a dissociation between the two types of stimuli when reproducing size, the illusion being elicited solely by numbers. When reproducing brightness, however, neither the letters nor the numbers elicited a bias. These findings suggest that, while only numerical magnitude, and not letters, elicits a bias in size perception, the concurrent processing of magnitude and brightness does not bring about the same illusion, supporting the idea of a relative independence in the processing of these two dimensions.",4,,484,484,Brightness; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Illusion; Perception; Size Perception; Numerical cognition; Magnitude (mathematics); Social psychology; Loudness; Ordinal number,brightness perception; cognitive Illusion; magnitude system; numerical cognition,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00484/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82834296 https://doaj.org/article/637a940381344e84bbf82b6e3422e8ad http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23908640 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3725837 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00484/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82834296.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00484,23908640,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00484,2119585179,PMC3725837,0,000-697-739-945-831; 001-244-253-407-376; 003-756-834-371-246; 004-007-191-858-824; 005-250-740-558-573; 005-930-588-003-053; 006-386-415-800-986; 007-996-363-197-55X; 009-236-177-112-760; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-407-879-612-124; 013-300-598-984-792; 014-043-776-728-225; 015-932-952-551-526; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-096-212-135-705; 018-066-357-545-886; 018-878-516-605-908; 019-951-812-912-392; 021-902-337-919-51X; 025-835-654-114-764; 026-380-955-565-508; 029-169-523-844-349; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-790-746-968-147; 031-219-176-520-888; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-869-715-499-155; 032-176-592-076-025; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-440-021-374-187; 039-569-462-353-364; 040-978-653-926-551; 041-744-175-231-513; 045-179-545-761-535; 047-584-386-471-064; 048-116-290-231-84X; 048-859-274-895-782; 049-725-492-962-923; 050-374-521-628-507; 052-170-651-034-465; 052-473-462-827-560; 052-995-718-438-891; 060-551-132-182-852; 062-228-779-575-465; 063-089-641-302-949; 066-089-489-617-442; 080-053-201-142-496; 088-177-896-909-90X; 089-953-015-050-96X; 093-902-625-829-836; 094-509-611-090-706; 104-898-249-163-45X; 111-018-649-993-810; 117-575-984-545-919; 118-581-038-700-756; 125-937-596-296-91X; 148-043-544-952-446; 153-174-100-314-196,15

In this article, a comprehensive and effective assessment method for motor and visually impaired people has been accomplished using analytical hierarchy process (AHP). In the first phase, the proposed evaluation is based on the comparative judgment of the clinical experts using the AHP rating scale. In the second phase, the evaluation is authenticated by incorporating user judgment scores based on multi-weighted scoring model (MWSM). The MWSM output values are then converted to the AHP scale. The AHP algorithm is applied on the basis of average scores obtained from both evaluations. The technique successfully explores the essential, supporting and optional technologies for various people with disabilities (PwD) as well as identifying the criteria weight used for assessing research articles and existing solutions. Moreover, the assessment criteria are used by MWSM to assess research papers related to motor and visual impairment conditions. The assessment techniques have successfully identified the relevant criteria that can be used to assess technological research papers.

Hilbig,"The recognition heuristic (RH) theory states that, in comparative judgments (e.g., Which of two cities has more inhabitants?), individuals infer that recognized objects score higher on the criterion (e.g., population) than unrecognized objects. Indeed, it has often been shown that recognized options are judged to outscore unrecognized ones (e.g., recognized cities are judged as larger than unrecognized ones), although different accounts of this general finding have been proposed. According to the RH theory, this pattern occurs because the binary recognition judgment determines the inference and no other information will reverse this. An alternative account posits that recognized objects are chosen because knowledge beyond mere recognition typically points to the recognized object. A third account can be derived from the memory-state heuristic framework. According to this framework, underlying memory states of objects (rather than recognition judgments) determine the extent of RH use: When two objects are compared, the one associated with a “higher” memory state is preferred, and reliance on recognition increases with the “distance” between their memory states. The three accounts make different predictions about the impact of subjective recognition experiences—whether an object is merely recognized or recognized with further knowledge—on RH use. We estimated RH use for different recognition experiences across 16 published data sets, using a multinomial processing tree model. Results supported the memory-state heuristic in showing that RH use increases when recognition is accompanied by further knowledge.; ; Electronic supplementary material; The online version of this article (doi:10.3758/s13423-014-0587-4) contains supplementary material, which is available to authorized users.",21,5,1131,1138,Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Heuristic; Recognition heuristic; Cognitive psychology; Multinomial distribution; Natural language processing; Inference; Population; Electronic Supplementary Material; Decision tree model; Recognition memory,,"Humans; Memory; Models, Psychological; Psychological Theory; Recognition, Psychology",,,https://experts.syr.edu/en/publications/the-impact-of-subjective-recognition-experiences-on-recognition-h https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13423-014-0587-4.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81099220 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4181781 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=293ffdec-e5d7-48bb-82a4-a7a79e4f98ad https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Benjamin_Hilbig/publication/260876052_The_impact_of_subjective_recognition_experiences_on_recognition_heuristic_use_A_multinomial_processing_tree_approach/links/00463532af7f979722000000.pdf https://madoc.bib.uni-mannheim.de/37298/ https://paperity.org/p/35102617/the-impact-of-subjective-recognition-experiences-on-recognition-heuristic-use-a https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3466731061/the-impact-of-subjective-recognition-experiences-on https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-014-0587-4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13423-014-0587-4 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4181781 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81099220.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13423-014-0587-4,24638825,10.3758/s13423-014-0587-4,2054523683,PMC4181781,0,006-240-462-825-885; 008-484-658-695-107; 009-188-129-583-580; 012-584-691-775-195; 016-757-798-654-922; 027-564-285-840-47X; 028-196-467-070-883; 032-049-177-406-929; 040-920-933-999-411; 042-058-916-478-748; 042-564-479-772-261; 044-729-100-505-384; 045-011-780-563-839; 046-332-902-642-126; 052-357-181-468-17X; 069-967-924-571-836; 076-784-374-453-123; 078-531-917-031-005; 108-674-900-395-78X; 113-067-244-251-003; 158-631-606-286-957,16

Reid; Paul Anthony Scuffham,"Background ; Beyond examining their overall cost-effectiveness and mechanisms of effect, it is important to understand patient preferences for the delivery of different modes of chronic heart failure management programs (CHF-MPs). We elicited patient preferences around the characteristics and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a clinic or home-based CHF-MP.; ; ; Methodology/Principal Findings ; A Discrete Choice Experiment was completed by a sub-set of patients (n = 91) enrolled in the WHICH? trial comparing home versus clinic-based CHF-MP. Participants provided 5 choices between hypothetical clinic and home-based programs varying by frequency of nurse consultations, nurse continuity, patient costs, and availability of telephone or education support. Participants (aged 71±13 yrs, 72.5% male, 25.3% NYHA class III/IV) displayed two distinct preference classes. A latent class model of the choice data indicated 56% of participants preferred clinic delivery, access to group CHF education classes, and lower cost programs (p<0.05). The remainder preferred home-based CHF-MPs, monthly rather than weekly visits, and access to a phone advice service (p<0.05). Continuity of nurse contact was consistently important. No significant association was observed between program preference and participant allocation in the parent trial. WTP was estimated from the model and a dichotomous bidding technique. For those preferring clinic, estimated WTP was ≈AU$9-20 per visit; however for those preferring home-based programs, WTP varied widely (AU$15-105).; ; ; Conclusions/Significance ; Patient preferences for CHF-MPs were dichotomised between a home-based model which is more likely to suit older patients, those who live alone, and those with a lower household income; and a clinic-based model which is more likely to suit those who are more socially active and wealthier. To optimise the delivery of CHF-MPs, health care services should consider their patients’ preferences when designing CHF-MPs.",8,3,1,8,Cost–benefit analysis; Health care; Alternative medicine; Willingness to pay; Health services research; Household income; Family medicine; Health economics; Latent class model; Medicine; Gerontology,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choice Behavior; Chronic Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disease Management; Female; Heart Failure/psychology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Preference; Socioeconomic Factors",,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058347 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/261577 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/19895 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/85502/1/85502%20Journal%20Article.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3591337 https://researchbank.acu.edu.au/fhs_pub/1755/ http://ecite.utas.edu.au/85502 https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:325320 https://paperity.org/p/61030420/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-based-program-of-chronic https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/79532/2/hdl_79532.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/16518950 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PLoSO...858347W/abstract https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/79532 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591337/ http://eprints.victorchang.edu.au/146/ https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/30631 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b-3 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058347 http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/54736/86577_1.pdf;sequence=1 https://research.torrens.edu.au/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b https://acuresearchbank.acu.edu.au/item/89531/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-based-program-of-chronic-heart-failure-management-findings-from-the-which-trial https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/54736 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58428/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16518950.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058347,23505491,10.1371/journal.pone.0058347,1996218086,PMC3591337,0,004-645-624-737-312; 004-903-227-535-281; 007-848-404-294-790; 007-918-607-348-614; 010-195-457-296-442; 013-813-279-154-883; 016-082-810-469-277; 019-733-899-604-476; 024-188-264-101-592; 026-146-102-140-668; 030-843-431-654-094; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-860-260-967-736; 041-672-649-119-516; 047-772-517-797-741; 052-097-839-766-248; 056-105-887-550-815; 056-874-654-501-138; 063-966-043-082-538; 065-011-766-727-839; 071-674-642-056-169; 093-149-980-450-604; 093-472-739-539-696; 095-720-759-868-465; 116-411-055-251-767; 131-098-763-329-081; 139-433-096-843-007; 142-102-784-505-222; 158-469-764-622-896; 160-441-821-953-411,55

On the basis of empirical research, it is possible to distinguish four types of mental number lines: the shortest mental number line, summation mental number lines, point-place mental number lines and mental lines of exact numbers. These structures may be treated as generative mechanisms of forming arithmetical representations underlying our numerical acts of reference towards cardinalities, ordinals and magnitudes. In the paper, the theoretical framework for a formal model of mental arithmetical representations is constructed. Many competitive conceptions of the mental system responsible for our arithmetical thinking may be unified within the presented framework. The paradigm underlying our research may be interpreted philosophically as a neo-Kantian approach to modeling the mind’s representational structures.",26,1,1,40,Arithmetic function; Empirical research; Cognitive science; Ontology; Mental number line; Mathematics; Cardinality; Generative grammar; Subitizing; Ordinal number; Arithmetic,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/61438118/representational-structures-of-arithmetical-thinking-part-i https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-015-9271-1 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-015-9271-1/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10516-015-9271-1 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81289509.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10516-015-9271-1,,10.1007/s10516-015-9271-1,2006420333,,0,000-333-219-424-701; 002-851-208-912-737; 003-626-441-665-213; 004-015-641-837-802; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-581-582-786-357; 005-725-817-996-691; 005-857-247-826-598; 007-835-818-761-237; 008-915-976-692-616; 009-236-177-112-760; 009-848-557-018-765; 010-294-410-265-319; 010-954-921-256-802; 011-021-940-448-844; 013-038-761-988-056; 013-431-925-540-372; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-715-023-202-849; 015-932-952-551-526; 015-992-070-091-075; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-576-453-371-676; 017-847-796-822-545; 019-135-231-838-82X; 022-172-903-350-351; 024-607-781-626-606; 026-380-955-565-508; 026-617-630-691-234; 026-942-036-955-89X; 027-123-158-573-600; 027-214-316-306-836; 029-596-767-400-126; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-219-176-520-888; 031-316-795-276-233; 031-869-715-499-155; 033-078-615-163-584; 033-103-575-610-635; 035-013-638-860-011; 035-402-974-768-248; 035-552-279-767-677; 035-931-248-212-820; 036-403-728-589-122; 036-412-993-844-272; 036-902-805-781-254; 037-436-823-090-386; 038-974-620-225-345; 039-569-462-353-364; 039-722-117-248-289; 040-787-625-865-307; 041-744-175-231-513; 042-027-187-250-871; 042-171-115-695-675; 043-288-458-558-686; 043-991-135-085-516; 044-542-339-645-119; 044-786-461-439-846; 045-269-829-470-288; 045-758-050-964-767; 045-965-362-317-923; 047-584-386-471-064; 049-092-751-377-693; 049-725-492-962-923; 050-226-266-734-956; 050-926-272-253-558; 053-756-966-193-449; 053-914-696-508-092; 054-073-002-603-611; 057-349-983-849-38X; 057-877-558-474-926; 058-978-410-071-695; 060-551-132-182-852; 060-778-427-738-113; 060-794-322-938-581; 060-847-933-305-843; 061-803-676-469-485; 064-938-778-968-688; 067-010-775-284-96X; 069-096-471-449-385; 069-952-634-268-159; 071-011-326-519-531; 071-057-839-637-721; 072-069-615-659-184; 073-989-930-529-45X; 078-649-785-249-179; 083-222-579-305-860; 083-688-007-922-85X; 084-525-058-359-286; 085-805-494-137-80X; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-604-548-762-471; 089-719-299-688-483; 091-466-931-295-798; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-272-102-076-652; 092-549-976-556-154; 092-715-514-577-680; 092-839-225-906-518; 093-468-101-878-849; 094-569-624-756-639; 096-167-391-482-040; 096-974-841-889-042; 097-168-070-287-368; 102-587-309-464-799; 104-274-457-891-501; 105-942-707-129-817; 108-164-445-874-825; 108-721-129-178-587; 109-356-419-856-140; 111-879-750-533-979; 112-709-258-606-94X; 113-220-149-594-719; 117-150-975-353-778; 118-581-038-700-756; 119-436-771-379-569; 120-791-951-129-93X; 121-368-836-505-037; 128-887-777-838-374; 130-220-493-077-784; 140-481-674-565-670; 140-596-764-632-267; 152-851-921-965-411; 153-172-818-063-059; 156-131-564-641-610; 167-388-826-583-987; 168-043-103-603-780; 177-015-691-281-199; 180-456-872-723-875,1

Do children process numbers automatically, and if so, what kind of information is activated? In a novel dot–number Stroop task, children (Grades 1–5) and adults were shown two different two-digit numbers made up of dots. Participants were asked to select the number that contained the larger dots. If numbers are processed automatically, reaction time for dot size judgment should be affected by numerical characteristics. The results suggest that, like adults, children process two-digit numbers automatically. Based on the current findings, we propose a developmental trend for automatic two-digit number processing that goes from decomposed sequential (activation of decade digit followed by that of unit digit) to decomposed parallel processing (simultaneous activation of decade and unit digits).",109,3,263,274,Primary education; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Digit number; Automaticity; Sequence learning; Numerical digit,,"Adult; Age Factors; Attention; Automatism/psychology; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematics; Neuropsychological Tests; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time",,,http://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/169084/1/Content.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/37994037 http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/169084 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ919449 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21397247 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022096511000324 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/37994037.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jecp.2011.01.010,21397247,10.1016/j.jecp.2011.01.010,2048780596,,0,001-679-928-292-38X; 005-691-887-337-576; 006-720-683-958-49X; 008-461-628-947-121; 009-848-557-018-765; 011-741-296-253-442; 013-992-144-467-088; 015-012-693-948-294; 019-099-455-661-319; 019-423-110-640-768; 025-402-033-432-459; 031-541-539-785-70X; 034-968-278-864-929; 038-452-699-914-996; 048-889-201-158-674; 050-226-266-734-956; 060-778-427-738-113; 062-173-665-198-934; 066-089-489-617-442; 080-307-144-100-405; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 127-499-539-914-545; 169-747-633-428-758,7

However, there are difficulties in the valid and reliable assessment of features of quality within designerly outputs. In light of recent educational reforms in Ireland, which see the introduction of classroom based assessments centring on design in the technology subjects, it is paramount that the implementation of design assessment is critically considered. An exploratory study was conducted with a 1st year cohort of initial technology teacher education students (N = 126) which involved them completing a design assignment and subsequent assessment process through the use of adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ). In considering the use of ACJ as a potential tool for design assessment at post-primary level, data analysis focused on criteria used for assessment. Results indicate that quantitative variables, i.e., the amount of work done, can significantly predict performance (R2 = .333, p &amp;lt;.001), however qualitative findings suggest that quantity may simply align with quality. Further results illustrate a significant yet practically meaningless bias may exist in the judgement of work through ACJ (φ = .082, p &amp;lt;.01) and that there was need to use varying criteria in the assessment of design outputs.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ys9eg,,10.31235/osf.io/ys9eg,,,0,,0

Human perception and performance,00961523; 19391277,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Bundy Mackintosh; Andrew Mathews; Emily Holden,"In several recent studies, P. A. MacDonald and colleagues (e.g., P. A. MacDonald & S. Joordens, 2000) reported unusually large negative priming effects and claimed that attention to distractors, counter to expectations, served to enhance the magnitude of the effect. In 3 experiments using their novel comparative judgment task, negative priming was assessed using both a control condition based on that of P. A. MacDonald, S. Joordens, and K. N. Seergobin (1999) and one in which control probe items exactly matched those on ignored repetition trials. In MacDonald et al.'s unmatched control condition, participants were faster than on ignored repetition trials, but this difference was reduced or absent when control items were matched. This result led to the conclusion that the apparently large negative priming effect reported by MacDonald and colleagues may be an artifact arising because judgments for a subset of their control trials were relatively easier than for ignored repetition trials.",28,6,1323,1329,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Negative priming; Distraction; Priming (psychology),,Affect; Attention; Humans; Photic Stimulation; Random Allocation; Semantics; Vocabulary,,,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/13189 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12542130 http://core.ac.uk/display/2763528,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.28.6.1323,12542130,10.1037/0096-1523.28.6.1323; 10.1037//0096-1523.28.6.1323,1991940295,,0,000-935-331-196-559; 006-340-949-726-473; 008-421-113-247-664; 012-392-187-722-83X; 013-461-748-035-988; 048-773-731-066-027; 070-788-349-318-309; 076-196-391-182-256; 076-896-273-497-713; 125-367-387-115-80X,6

Vaak worden de taken van studenten een per een van feedback voorzien middels opmerkingen in de tekst (= klassieke feedback). Recentelijk is echter een alternatieve methode van beoordelen geintroduceerd: paarsgewijze vergelijking (Comparative Judgement, CJ). In CJ wordt aan meerdere beoordelaars gevraagd het werk van studenten per twee te vergelijken en aan te geven welke het beste is (Pollitt, 2012). Op basis van deze vergelijkingen kan een ranking worden opgesteld van goede naar minder goede schrijftaak. Het principe dat beoordelaars makkelijker kwaliteit kunnen duiden in een vergelijking ligt ten grondslag aan deze methode (Thurstone (1927). Huidig onderzoek laat de summatieve voordelen van CJ inzake betrouwbaarheid en validiteit zien (Pollitt, 2012). Dit onderzoek exploreert de formatieve mogelijkheden van CJ door het met de klassieke methode te vergelijken.; ; Feedback kan getypeerd worden op twee dimensies (Walker, 2009). De eerste dimensie onderscheidt de motiverende feedback van de feedback die aangeeft wat beter kan. De tweede dimensie onderscheidt productgericht (aangeven wat goed/niet goed is) van leergerichte feedback (uitleg waarom iets goed/niet goed is). Daarnaast kan feedback geanalyseerd worden naar de inhoudelijke elementen waar het betrekking op heeft. Hyland (2001) geeft aan dat in haar onderzoek opmerkingen over de structuur en organisatie van de essays door studenten als meest bruikbaar benoemd worden. Zij vonden feedback op spelling en interpunctie minder nuttig. Zowel Hyland (2001) als Walker (2009) richtten zich op de klassieke methode.; ; Tot nu hebben enkel [Auteurs (2015)] onderzoek gedaan naar CJ-gebaseerde feedback. Hieruit blijkt dat studenten deze eerlijk, relevant en betrouwbaar vinden. Er is echter geen zicht op of CJ formatieve voordelen biedt voor de beoordelaars en of de inhoud van de feedback verschilt van de klassieke methode.; ; Om inzicht te krijgen in de formatieve mogelijkheden van CJ worden de volgende vragen gesteld:; 1. Welke methode leent zich volgens beoordelaars beter tot het geven van feedback: CJ of de klassieke methode? 2. Verschillen CJ en de klassieke methode van soort feedback dat het genereert?",,,,,Art; Humanities,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7239865,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/7239865,,,2410553970,,0,,0

Participants were divided into low-vision, severely myopic, and normal-vision groups. Five stimulus heights were explored with three cane lengths, varying cane diameters, and judgment types. The participants were asked to estimate the stimulus height with or without reference to a standard block. Results showed that the constant error ratio for estimated height improved with decreasing cane length and comparative judgment. The findings were unclear regarding the effect of cane length on haptic perception of height.

In order to strengthen the exchange of experience related to decommissioning activities in the world, both in 2002 Germany Berlin and in 2006 Greece Athens, IAEA held the international conference on lessons learned from the decommissioning twice. Decommissioning was one of the most important conference topics each time. The meeting also reached a consensus that it is necessary to consider decommissioning as soon as possible.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>This paper analyzes and discusses nine kinds of factors influencing decommissioning strategy, including source survey, waste management, government policy, decommissioning step, decommissioning cost, decommissioning technology, public acceptance, soil acceptable level and optimization of radiation protection. These nine factors are chosen for a variety of factors on the comprehensive consideration of affecting degree. In other word, they are more important factors to represent the problem as thoroughly as possible.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) is a systematic and hierarchical multi-objective decision analysis method. It is a basic approach to decision making which is proposed by T L. Saaty in 1970s, who is a professor of Pittsburgh University and the primary theoretician of AHP. In this paper, the goal is how to choose the appropriate decommissioning strategy using the method of AHP. The preferred decommissioning strategy should consider various factors, such as policy, economy, radiation protection, public acceptance, waste management and so on. Some factors are quantitative while others are qualitative. At present, there are three kinds of nuclear power plant (NPP) decommissioning strategy including immediate dismantling, deferred dismantling and entombment. The three kinds of decommissioning strategies all have their respective pros and cros.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>Analytic hierarchy model includes goal layer, criterion layer and program layer. In this paper, selection of decommissioning strategy is the goal layer. Nine chosen factors make up the criterion layer and three different decommissioning strategies constitute the program layer. The next step is comparative judgment which means the elements on the criterion layer are arranged into a matrix and the goal makes judgment about the relative importance of the elements with respect to the overall goal. The matrixes of pairwise comparisons of facts in criterion layer to program layer are also given in the paper. The fundamental scale of values to represent the intensities of judgments is the 1∼9 scale.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>For each pairwise comparison matrix, the maximum eigenvalue and corresponding eigenvector are calculated. Consistency index (CI), random Consistency Index (RI) and consistency ratio (CR) are used to check consistency. In case inspection result meets the conformance requirement, normalized feature vector is the weight vector. On the contrary, it is needed to reconstruct the pairwise comparison matrix. Only by all matrixes go through consistency checking can results meet the satisfied conformance requirements. Meanwhile, the weights of nine factors in pairwise comparison matrixes are also discussed in the paper.</jats:p>;                <jats:p>In summary, based on the principle of AHP, an analytic hierarchy model of NPP decommissioning strategy choice has been established. Paired comparison judgments in the AHP are applied to pairs of these factors. The AHP method uses pairwise comparison of factors and contrasts them using a relative scale in order to minimize the difference in the nature of the different factors to compare with each other and also improve accuracy. The calculation results show that deferred dismantling (Weight: 0.4663) is superior to immediate dismantling (Weight: 0.3768), and immediate dismantling is better than entombment (Weight: 0.1569). These factors are ranked according to the weight of calculation results. The top three factors are government policies (Weight: 0.3512), decommissioning cost (Weight: 0.2038) and waste management (Weight: 0.1611).</jats:p>",,,,,Construction engineering; Public policy; Nuclear decommissioning; Decision analysis; Nuclear power plant; Environmental science; Waste management; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2577245 https://gasturbinespower.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICONE/proceedings/ICONE24/50053/V005T15A004/252195 http://proceedings.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=2577245 https://asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICONE/proceedings/ICONE24/50053/V005T15A004/252195 https://offshoremechanics.asmedigitalcollection.asme.org/ICONE/proceedings/ICONE24/50053/V005T15A004/252195,http://dx.doi.org/10.1115/icone24-60117,,10.1115/icone24-60117,2538444439,,0,,1

Kardes; Steven S. Posavac; Maria L. Cronley,"Because products are rarely described completely, consumers often form inferences that go beyond the information given. We review research on the processes, bases, and the judgment contexts in which inferences are formed. The most basic processes are induction (inferences from specific instances to general principles) versus deduction (inferences from general principles to specific instances). Stimulus-based inferences are formed on-line (as information is encountered) using situationally available information, whereas memory-based (or theory-based) inferences are formed using prior knowledge and experience. Inferences can pertain to a single product judged in isolation (a singular judgment context) or to multiple products considered in relation to one another (a comparative judgment context). This 2x2x2 (Induction vs. Deduction x Stimulus-Based vs. Memory-Based x Singular vs. Comparative Judgment) theoretical framework suggests that there are 8 different types of inferences that consumers may form. Based on this framework, we identify gaps in the literature and suggest directions for future research.",14,3,230,256,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Inference; Single product; Social psychology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/100063100 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1207/s15327663jcp1403_6 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740804701527 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740804701527,http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327663jcp1403_6,,10.1207/s15327663jcp1403_6,2064927577,,0,000-227-718-574-158; 000-343-678-303-916; 001-048-772-705-086; 003-014-620-687-461; 003-937-107-830-314; 003-987-150-626-381; 005-553-153-856-945; 005-822-657-462-328; 005-924-466-127-751; 005-971-702-343-651; 006-647-095-172-249; 007-215-416-222-778; 007-297-919-764-247; 007-831-783-818-994; 008-546-399-959-067; 009-760-549-021-407; 010-689-873-879-444; 010-850-588-940-830; 011-460-675-006-504; 012-145-121-934-997; 012-172-515-322-946; 012-358-958-480-981; 013-770-578-930-523; 013-962-677-403-186; 015-179-355-373-39X; 015-466-567-680-967; 015-785-974-287-693; 016-642-746-249-933; 016-753-176-239-152; 016-784-718-176-97X; 017-029-116-133-38X; 017-320-982-699-180; 018-136-047-292-810; 018-137-380-921-689; 019-219-588-757-879; 020-330-991-777-627; 022-305-394-927-656; 023-140-195-589-037; 024-057-160-959-498; 024-870-532-864-425; 025-484-193-694-61X; 025-990-042-945-006; 026-356-032-171-498; 026-840-293-933-715; 027-142-278-426-537; 027-189-592-209-993; 027-643-790-356-203; 027-731-334-437-608; 027-744-731-026-645; 027-911-096-826-197; 028-292-605-075-78X; 028-358-749-840-291; 029-091-639-120-134; 030-366-771-393-311; 030-920-314-889-819; 034-971-467-712-85X; 035-623-115-598-200; 036-228-574-475-812; 036-873-274-160-554; 036-962-225-909-922; 037-110-043-957-049; 038-231-524-591-452; 038-650-936-944-425; 038-709-464-201-474; 039-681-946-885-711; 039-908-833-846-891; 040-611-339-872-646; 041-533-021-630-714; 043-141-102-769-961; 044-273-932-399-489; 045-240-210-914-587; 046-025-797-619-409; 046-710-349-264-11X; 048-208-720-338-398; 048-665-002-551-016; 049-034-559-941-05X; 050-879-626-363-553; 051-420-334-103-079; 051-791-529-019-611; 051-815-398-023-517; 051-945-017-046-033; 051-985-685-602-812; 052-123-327-659-656; 052-286-473-796-102; 053-044-156-353-476; 053-620-544-583-604; 053-874-003-630-164; 055-086-437-950-988; 055-930-225-537-893; 056-558-226-014-734; 056-672-370-150-588; 057-712-588-263-956; 061-195-844-075-113; 061-992-799-627-469; 062-393-414-660-164; 062-420-560-074-770; 063-610-172-302-704; 063-673-922-002-582; 064-924-710-843-339; 064-972-416-327-049; 065-152-186-301-400; 067-043-648-074-16X; 067-432-425-105-546; 068-507-553-395-023; 068-708-081-216-621; 072-875-976-356-935; 072-891-831-315-278; 075-666-452-309-677; 075-900-511-923-187; 076-240-727-356-56X; 077-303-057-473-872; 078-782-810-370-169; 079-055-940-820-979; 080-602-572-807-337; 080-893-594-231-001; 081-773-639-506-815; 086-795-096-438-48X; 087-228-473-950-231; 089-580-057-169-812; 090-872-089-416-38X; 091-281-314-383-193; 092-907-702-727-515; 093-156-756-355-974; 094-409-373-161-186; 094-593-004-106-563; 095-133-537-012-550; 096-173-587-424-003; 098-598-724-537-124; 099-618-606-495-981; 101-065-490-079-435; 101-933-856-573-698; 105-193-106-595-93X; 105-879-042-327-325; 106-243-234-167-672; 109-471-040-409-067; 109-546-766-711-381; 110-055-879-281-073; 110-125-636-285-513; 114-597-021-587-460; 115-684-957-870-716; 116-037-810-683-874; 120-978-790-375-653; 121-008-441-429-149; 122-370-312-663-586; 123-143-577-332-121; 123-491-867-509-133; 123-695-526-697-740; 123-862-533-094-206; 125-115-990-023-837; 125-476-469-867-426; 126-293-498-343-503; 128-198-376-901-930; 128-433-498-007-678; 128-496-578-903-550; 129-989-557-169-379; 130-568-567-933-588; 131-789-745-959-074; 132-254-328-720-391; 133-326-502-649-508; 136-024-340-063-955; 136-138-511-830-094; 137-596-161-565-589; 141-022-843-692-421; 142-723-021-113-871; 143-401-585-527-580; 143-718-252-194-605; 144-054-177-153-041; 148-223-435-969-407; 152-778-060-951-924; 154-605-928-621-725; 160-652-532-329-575; 163-368-978-140-006; 163-413-656-134-535; 169-570-452-310-792; 173-598-228-804-869; 179-592-522-320-209; 183-100-484-060-661; 184-489-904-882-712; 184-823-321-992-11X; 186-690-915-989-029; 188-645-536-562-965; 190-086-181-064-265; 190-321-798-155-199,340

Scott-Samuel; Johan Hulleman,"Human observers are able to estimate the numerosity of large sets of visual elements. The occupancy model of perceived numerosity in intermediate numerical ranges is based on overlapping regions of influence. The key idea is that items within a certain range count for less than their actual numerical value and more so the closer they are to their neighbours. Therefore occupancy is sensitive to the grouping of elements, but there are other spatial properties of  configurations that could also influence perceived numerosity, such as: area of convex hull, occupancy area, total degree of connectivity, and local clustering For all indices apart from convex hull, we varied the radius of the area that defined neighbours. We tested perceived numerosity using a fixed number of elements placed at random within a circular region. Observers compared two patterns (presented in two intervals) and chose the one that appeared more numerous. The same observers performed two other separate tasks in which they judged which pattern appeared more dispersed or more clustered. In each pair of images, the number was always the same (22, 28, 34, or 40 items), because we were interested in which ""appeared"" more numerous on the basis of spatial configuration. The results suggest that estimates of numerosity, dispersion, and clustering are based on different spatial information, that there are alternative approaches to quantifying clustering, and that in all cases clustering is linked to a decrease in perceived numerosity. The alternative measures have different properties and different practical and computational advantages.",78,5,1460,1471,Artificial intelligence; Spatial analysis; Occupancy; Numerosity adaptation effect; Dispersion (optics); Pattern recognition; Convex hull; Spatial clustering; Mathematics; Cluster analysis; Graph theory,Clustering; Graph theory; Numerosity; Occupancy,"Adolescent; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Spatial Processing; Young Adult",,Economic and Social Research Council,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27142523/ https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/files/36607268/BertaminiZitoScottSamuelHullemanAPP2016.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758%2Fs13414-016-1100-0.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27142523 https://paperity.org/p/76225087/spatial-clustering-and-its-effect-on-perceived-clustering-numerosity-and-dispersion https://core.ac.uk/display/74192418 https://www.europepmc.org/articles/PMC4914534/ https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/spatial-clustering-and-its-effect-on-perceived-clustering-numeros https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/spatial-clustering-and-its-effect-on-perceived-clustering-numerosity-and-dispersion(a6e95696-7450-444a-88cb-e2d4f1d16c12).html https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-016-1100-0 https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3001187/ https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/76351130/Spatial_clustering_and_its_effect_on_perceived_clustering_numerosity_and_dispersion.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80776091.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-016-1100-0,27142523,10.3758/s13414-016-1100-0,2346631686,PMC4914534,0,002-351-187-456-259; 004-063-291-705-127; 004-451-533-015-01X; 009-426-181-735-482; 011-144-067-328-839; 015-431-261-366-502; 017-192-877-028-832; 017-194-514-350-522; 019-640-192-172-363; 021-144-010-769-775; 030-100-364-068-88X; 033-451-484-181-557; 034-263-892-054-31X; 036-411-476-530-721; 037-454-482-238-600; 038-851-711-092-541; 042-366-406-891-692; 042-793-844-821-092; 045-005-800-601-29X; 048-797-819-664-730; 049-092-751-377-693; 049-816-140-612-501; 051-905-742-573-622; 052-274-814-673-883; 054-674-417-361-62X; 055-440-259-729-998; 058-484-878-223-236; 062-542-611-016-980; 062-906-094-628-798; 064-130-840-933-119; 064-308-714-280-597; 069-521-385-478-387; 082-964-869-668-527; 087-413-274-524-461; 089-863-236-892-707; 092-491-995-641-38X; 093-914-548-851-797; 095-280-335-141-207; 096-507-969-290-685; 102-755-968-592-356; 106-936-931-089-579; 113-316-663-712-294; 144-747-377-111-26X; 148-738-002-816-897; 153-174-100-314-196,9

Amookht; S. Gorji Kandi; Mohammad Mahdavian,"Abstract The industrial need for controlling the quality of metallic coatings for producing efficient and high-quality products makes it necessary to conduct an appearance quantification process. In this study, it had been attempted to present an appropriate algorithm to analyze the coarseness property of the metallic coatings using the image processing technique and texture analysis methods to achieve acceptable correlation with visual perception. For this purpose, we examined metallic silver and metallic blue coatings containing eight grades of aluminum flakes with different size distributions from fine to coarse cases. After capturing the images of samples using a scanner, they were studied using different texture analysis methods including autocorrelation function, distance-dependent edge frequency, gray level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM), Fourier transform and wavelet transform. Visual assessments were performed using a comparative judgment method. The precisions of the applied analysis methods were evaluated based on the correlation between their results and the visual assessment data. According to the obtained data, the autocorrelation function with R-squares of 0.88 and 0.9 for the metallic silver and metallic blue coatings, and also wavelet transform in the vertical channel with R-squares of 0.86 and 0.89 for the same mentioned coatings, respectively, had the best performance in comparison to visual perception. Consequently, it was possible to precisely quantify the coarseness perception of metallic coating using autocorrelation function and the wavelet transform as two feasible texture analysis methods.

However, in real-world scenarios, some items are intrinsically ambiguous in comparisons, which may very well be an inherent uncertainty of the data. In this case, the conventional total order ranking can not capture such uncertainty with mere global ranking or utility scores. In this paper, we are specifically interested in the recent surge in crowdsourcing applications to predict partial but more accurate (i.e., making less incorrect statements) orders rather than complete ones. To do so, we propose a novel framework to learn some probabilistic models of partial orders as a margin-based Maximum Likelihood Estimate (MLE) method. We prove that the induced MLE is a joint convex optimization problem with respect to all the parameters, including the global ranking scores and margin parameter. Moreover, three kinds of generalized linear models are studied, including the basic uniform model, Bradley-Terry model, and Thurstone-Mosteller model, equipped with some theoretical analysis on FDR and Power control for the proposed methods. The validity of these models are supported by experiments with both simulated and real-world datasets, which shows that the proposed models exhibit improvements compared with traditional state-of-the-art algorithms.",,,591,599,Mathematical optimization; Convex optimization; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Computer science; Generalized linear model; Maximum likelihood; Probabilistic logic; Power control; Crowdsourcing; Mathematical optimization; Convex optimization; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Computer science; Generalized linear model; Maximum likelihood; Probabilistic logic; Power control; Crowdsourcing,,,,"CCF-Tencent Open Research Fund; National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program); Hong Kong Research Grant Council (HKRGC) grant; Si Family Foundation; National Natural Science Foundation of China; Youth Innovation Promotion Association CAS; awards form Baidu Big Data Institute; awards from Microsoft Research-Asia; Beijing Natural Science Foundation; National Key R&D Program of China; Key Research Program of Frontier Sciences, CAS; awards from Tencent AI Lab",https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/3240508.3240597 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/mm/mm2018.html#XuX0YCHY18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3240508.3240597,,10.1145/3240508.3240597,3098711891; 2884428394,,0,002-033-126-481-705; 004-323-910-689-639; 006-571-610-323-702; 009-093-555-680-031; 009-881-393-198-900; 010-136-645-510-231; 012-215-968-608-75X; 012-349-544-287-810; 016-428-347-316-433; 031-908-914-921-16X; 035-776-610-863-582; 056-237-740-895-047; 062-809-108-147-246; 063-844-594-135-055; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-585-600-009-791; 073-005-355-486-865; 077-588-658-541-158; 082-612-010-145-214; 082-740-587-442-412; 083-659-901-545-929; 085-861-722-490-418; 089-039-028-188-541; 094-222-344-008-721; 095-563-603-963-814; 107-776-541-414-299; 109-668-006-494-690; 112-722-992-850-273; 113-278-954-446-219; 116-275-534-296-096; 125-119-982-166-983; 127-134-528-683-700; 137-940-671-974-155; 150-500-848-539-370; 168-081-247-605-520; 174-619-377-275-100; 187-350-157-372-059; 192-433-348-869-417,4

Beverland,"While recent years have seen an increased use of educational and entertaining events within the store environment, little seems known about how consumers value such events. This study investigates how the staging of education and entertainment-focused in-store events impacts on consumers’ value perceptions, arousal levels and store satisfaction. It is hypothesized that such events have a positive effect on store satisfaction but that their effects are moderated by a shopper’s motivational orientation. Findings from a scenario-based experiment among 786 shoppers from two retail categories (hardware and computer stores) provide support for this. The findings show that task-oriented consumers derive more value and satisfaction from an education-focused event than from an entertainment-focused event, while recreation-oriented consumers appreciate either type of event. The study findings imply that providing education themed events is a safer option for retailers than providing entertainment-focused events because education satisfies a wider range of shopper needs. Shoppers overall derive pleasure from entertainment but task-oriented shoppers tend to also see it as a hindrance to the convenience of shopping, with the result that for these shoppers the hosting of entertainment-focused events may result in reduced store satisfaction levels.",23,,9,20,Advertising; Business; Marketing; Perception; SAFER; Pleasure; Entertainment,,,,Australian Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698914001647 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/how-in-store-educational-and-entertaining-events-influence-shoppe http://opus.bath.ac.uk/43322/ https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/how-in-store-educational-and-entertaining-events-influence-shoppe https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/joreco/v23y2015icp9-20.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38145638.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2014.11.004,,10.1016/j.jretconser.2014.11.004,2018695380,,0,000-201-137-552-369; 003-140-732-125-401; 005-805-453-463-041; 007-854-482-510-648; 007-964-360-049-977; 008-745-725-231-357; 008-781-154-400-468; 009-654-701-895-098; 009-660-310-368-080; 015-352-058-145-645; 021-291-831-006-396; 021-509-034-781-225; 022-014-783-792-118; 022-550-699-411-326; 022-738-560-755-25X; 024-590-112-768-385; 024-987-970-387-779; 025-724-556-647-792; 031-435-333-872-040; 032-836-393-727-80X; 037-182-375-780-06X; 037-961-038-553-803; 039-509-402-080-005; 040-105-697-406-299; 043-605-963-780-196; 044-871-194-437-438; 047-344-438-668-289; 049-660-750-407-427; 050-990-830-807-807; 052-870-760-945-978; 054-396-638-063-063; 055-690-424-934-672; 057-291-391-588-041; 064-682-467-305-522; 070-371-526-233-178; 071-108-508-815-500; 074-183-102-061-103; 074-302-411-610-574; 075-018-831-496-091; 076-108-758-116-907; 080-704-095-964-360; 084-128-479-124-398; 085-065-381-644-265; 088-297-250-020-315; 090-937-029-701-095; 091-967-938-887-169; 093-068-966-014-086; 093-776-900-484-728; 095-025-581-845-420; 098-745-061-538-27X; 104-921-910-226-066; 105-693-812-746-257; 112-669-526-477-352; 113-565-849-458-391; 120-620-795-116-97X; 122-046-490-794-277; 124-078-512-127-213; 124-997-949-036-098; 125-142-571-566-486; 131-651-986-799-153; 132-036-228-529-148; 134-530-538-554-839; 143-900-293-611-306; 146-429-317-292-299; 147-012-047-702-018; 148-760-101-987-81X; 151-581-866-638-448; 151-724-363-481-667; 154-445-350-994-401; 154-864-825-745-633; 156-797-365-377-416; 166-041-022-341-019; 169-794-449-204-481; 171-452-483-413-801; 173-048-998-587-905; 173-316-897-160-45X; 190-434-311-500-968; 192-196-957-352-548,17

Aikin,"EPISTEMIC THEORIES OF ARGUMENT: AN OVERVIEW The epistemic theory of argument is the view that arguments are to be evaluated in terms of their comprising epistemic reasons. This is to say, good arguments are those that are conducive of or pursuant of knowledge. Epistemic theories of argument vary according to how knowledge and epistemic reasons are delineated--from, for example, the veritistic and social in Goldman's analysis (1999, 2003) to the evidentialist and individual in Feldman's (1994, 2005). What makes these widespread forms of a family is the central role that the concepts of knowledge and epistemic justification play in the analysis of what constitutes good arguments. What follows in this section is a rough map of the dialectical terrain around epistemic theories of argument. My overall objective is to provide defenses for epistemic theories of argument as a family from objections arising from the rhetorical tradition. The appeal of epistemic theories can be captured by the axiological and the constitutive norm arguments. The axiological argument is that since arguments are to be normatively evaluated, a theory of argument must provide criteria for those evaluations. Epistemic theories provide normative criteria for good arguments and may be deployed to explain why fallacies are fallacious: they fail in some way or other to provide epistemic support. The alternatives, as the argument goes, fail to provide such explanations. Rhetorical theories provide criteria for evaluation (that of eliciting assent), but then cannot address the problem of fallacies (they convince, but shouldn't). This, again, is a rough challenge for the rhetorical theories of argument, one that stretches all the way back to Socrates' concerns about rhetoric in the Gorgias (465 a-d). Pragrna-dialectical strategies evaluate arguments on their procedural correctness in rationally reducing conflict, but they leave open the question of why the procedures should be rational and what the nature of that rationality is. On the axiological argument, epistemic theories are the last standing (cf. Biro & Siegel, 1992, 1997; Feldman, 1999; Freeman, 2006). The constitutive norm argument is that so long as arguments are supposed to achieve any change in view from audiences, as the competing theories hold, they must do so on (or on what passes for) good epistemic grounds. Listeners don't knowingly change their minds about things unless they think that adopting the new view puts them in a better cognitive position with regard to the truth of what is believed. Epistemic reasons provide that connection between belief and truth, so arguments, by their bearing on the truth of their conclusions, must be epistemically bounded (cf. Aikin 2006, 2008a; Cherwitz, 1977; Cherwitz & Darwin, 1995; Cherwitz & Hikins, 1986; Heysse, 1998; Scott, 1967, 1976; Stark, 2000; Zaner, 1968). This is to say that so long as one changes one's mind about a matter only under the conditions that one takes the new view as more likely true than its competitors, the reasons for this comparative judgment must bear on and be productive of knowledge of the truth of those theses. Those reasons are, by definition, epistemic reasons. As a consequence, epistemic theories are of a broader family with logical theories of argument--that one constitutive objective of arguments is arriving in a manner that confers the committed subject with a warrant for her conclusion. Epistemic theories assess the connection between premises and conclusions as argumentative products in a similar, but broader, fashion compared to logical theories. But these theories, again, broadly take arguments as the primary object of evaluation, and are posited on the assessment of the connection between reasons proposed or presumed and the conclusion according to general rules of good reasoning. There has been a measure of resistance to epistemic theories. A number of lines of argument have come out, and here I will respond to three I take as connected and widespread. …",44,3,130,142,Epistemology; Norm (social); Dialectic; Rhetoric; Philosophy; Rhetorical question; Rationality; Warrant; SOCRATES; Normative,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/AIKTOT https://philpapers.org/archive/AIKTOT.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-202438308/three-objections-to-the-epistemic-theory-of-argument,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00028533.2008.11821683,,10.1080/00028533.2008.11821683,3125160844,,0,000-551-387-427-536; 001-198-028-409-979; 003-278-196-261-881; 007-641-839-663-497; 010-625-447-918-137; 017-997-133-859-527; 019-897-365-585-486; 022-340-790-995-937; 025-456-438-212-87X; 027-630-024-293-669; 033-006-158-644-303; 033-936-199-168-113; 036-937-207-549-965; 040-478-280-777-299; 047-766-406-133-562; 052-732-482-002-965; 063-323-325-897-795; 072-549-661-596-922; 077-149-028-340-947; 078-115-442-954-750; 080-036-023-644-121; 089-021-119-999-619; 094-567-559-943-681; 098-665-326-996-963; 104-573-029-496-53X; 132-342-159-980-431; 140-278-734-674-681; 145-345-464-213-170; 149-221-280-527-299; 153-838-094-411-545; 163-203-955-143-858,4

Although histopathological changes associated with the parasite were not observed, the spores formed plasmodia that partially blocked the gastric and intestinal mucosa and gut lumen and may affect the perfomance and survival of the yellowfin goby. Morphological features of the spores resembled Henneguya sp. and molecular analysis of the 18S ribosomal DNA (Domain III) confirmed close similarity to H. rhinogobii and H. pseudorhinogobii isolated from the Japanese freshwater goby. The yellowfin goby myxozoan however, is likely an undescribed species based on phylogenetic analysis and morphologic features. Detailed description of vegetative and spore stages are currently lacking for proposal to a new species of Henneguya. A specific PCR test was developed, which confirmed a 100% prevalence of the parasite among randomly collected gobies in group 1 (N = 30) and group 2 (N = 15) at termination of the study at one month in captivity. The myxozoan was also detected from 18 gobies (12%) that died in the first group within two weeks in captivity. Apparently healthy gobies that served as controls did not reveal the presence of the myxozoan by PCR. This study documents the occurrence of a potentially new species of myxozoan in the yellowfin goby and underscores the detection of a parasitic infection in an introduced fish in the SFE. Although the pathogenesis of the myxozoan was not assessed and the prevalence as reported here is restricted to a comparatively small collection site in Suisun slough, the reemergence, identification, and ecological relevance of the parasite on goby populations in the SFE may be investigated in the future using the specific diagnostic tool developed in this study.",2,1,420,420,Spore; Ecology; Ribosomal DNA; Acanthogobius flavimanus; Captivity; Goby; Intestinal mucosa; Parasite hosting; Biology; Estuary; Zoology,Henneguya; Myxozoan; San Francisco Estuary; Yellowfin goby,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3423m8jr http://www.springerplus.com/content/2/1/420 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3765604/ https://paperity.org/p/34898801/henneguya-sp-in-yellowfin-goby-acanthogobius-flavimanus-from-the-san-francisco-estuary https://ucdavis.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/henneguya-sp-in-yellowfin-goby-acanthogobius-flavimanus-from-the- https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/2193-1801-2-420 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/2193-1801-2-420 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3765604 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81513651.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/2193-1801-2-420,24024104,10.1186/2193-1801-2-420,2117308856,PMC3765604,0,000-541-896-956-12X; 003-455-959-927-245; 003-781-839-947-042; 006-647-651-059-993; 010-657-081-524-403; 011-993-601-970-570; 013-838-748-652-174; 015-727-313-999-380; 017-238-743-704-648; 019-621-115-057-229; 019-783-955-627-628; 023-113-318-641-883; 025-208-586-429-306; 025-660-468-375-221; 036-255-676-349-255; 039-552-790-065-707; 041-156-270-519-530; 043-622-776-825-867; 043-624-996-336-626; 054-073-027-882-063; 059-128-405-518-689; 059-263-790-769-928; 067-111-177-906-733; 067-585-015-817-337; 069-048-762-790-990; 071-181-083-342-517; 072-581-901-427-934; 074-838-135-756-280; 077-992-468-021-56X; 080-552-718-700-987; 080-575-751-140-67X; 081-355-016-757-069; 086-652-817-819-832; 087-370-136-458-702; 089-992-459-771-727; 100-371-462-440-35X; 100-913-179-730-603; 121-944-894-756-523; 135-581-422-583-909; 140-342-063-855-601; 159-783-128-269-536; 161-685-219-116-124,7

This plant is considered to be a potential solution to the prevailing shortage of fossil fuel and the resulting environmental impacts. Cognizant of this, governments have given considerable attention to develop biodiesel technologies including that of jatropha. Development of biodiesel technologies has also attracted interest of national and international investors in Ethiopia. However, there is a gap of information with regard to how much land can potentially be allocated for biodiesel development. In this study, Geographic Information System (GIS) was used to identify those potential areas. Data of relevant environment factors influencing growth and productivity of jatropha such as climate, soils and topography were used for this purpose. Generally, results of overlay analysis for biophysical suitability evaluation using GIS identified 15.07% and 76.57% of the land as highly suitable and moderately suitable for jatropha production, respectively. The main limiting factors identified in this study are elevation, climate and water logging condition of soils. Sensitivity analysis based on land use change patterns shows that the size of suitable sites decreases significantly. Around 42% of the suitable sites were also identified as accessible by road and railway transport systems at distances less than 20 kilometres. In general, adequate land is available for jatropha investment in the country. However, allocation of land for jatropha production should be done based on accessibility of the identified suitable sites to transport facilities.",93,,82,88,"Land use, land-use change and forestry; Subtropics; Jatropha curcas; Jatropha; Environmental science; Geographic information system; Biodiesel; Agroforestry; Agronomy; Fossil fuel; Waterlogging (agriculture)",,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82239566 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661021630580X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187661021630580X https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82239566.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2016.07.153,,10.1016/j.egypro.2016.07.153,2524043062,,0,009-881-393-198-900; 014-004-497-934-50X; 052-313-346-763-085; 052-890-333-311-549; 064-036-288-336-458; 082-121-389-872-945; 092-276-767-500-559; 114-692-249-230-463; 147-337-371-817-293; 185-272-154-510-109,4

The purpose of this paper is to integrate products and services to achieve functional results that augment the offering’s value.

An inadequate evaluation of the latter leads to an inconsistent PSS design that results in the customer dissatisfaction.; ; ; ; ; Design/methodology/approach; ; ; ; ; To address these concerns, the paper proposes an approach integrating the quality function deployment for product-service systems (QFDforPSS) method with Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgments.

The constraints imposed by such factors could prevent organizations from fully remedying all of the vulnerabilities that expose their (critical) assets to risk. Therefore, an involved decision maker (e.g. security officer) has to strategically decide on the allocation of possible remediation efforts towards minimizing the inherent security risk. This, however, involves the use of comparative judgments to prioritize risks and remediation actions. Throughout this work, the security risk is quantified using the security metric Time-To-Compromise (TTC). Our main contribution is to provide a generic TTC estimator to comparatively assess the security posture of computer networks taking into account interdependencies between the network components, different adversary skill levels, and characteristics of (known and zero-day) vulnerabilities. The presented estimator relies on a stochastic TTC model and Monte Carlo simulation (MCS) techniques to account for the input data variability and inherent prediction uncertainties.",,,1,3,Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Estimator; Interdependence; Vulnerability; Monte Carlo method; Officer; Computer science; Adversary; Compromise,,,,,http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/kivs/netsys2019.html#AlshawishSM19 https://doi.org/10.1109/NetSys.2019.8854511 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8854511 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8847242/8854488/08854511.pdf?arnumber=8854511,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/netsys.2019.8854511,,10.1109/netsys.2019.8854511,2977529476,,0,000-505-952-400-524; 005-570-606-248-016; 014-744-861-279-235; 046-763-059-435-418; 079-102-361-192-647; 090-109-887-175-876,1

This paper provides three contributions on a Bayesian nonparametric approach to solve this problem. First, we establish contraction rates of the posterior distribution. We also propose a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm to approximately sample from this posterior distribution inspired from a recent Bayesian nonparametric method for hidden Markov models. Finally, the performance of this algorithm are appreciated by comparing predictions on the issue of a championship based on the actual values of the teams and those obtained by sampling from the estimated posterior distribution.",,,,,Algorithm; Random variable; Pairwise comparison; Hidden Markov model; Markov chain monte carlo algorithm; Random environment; Bayesian nonparametrics; Mathematics; Posterior probability; Sampling (statistics),,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08104 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1808.08104 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08104.pdf https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01860352 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01860352/document https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180808104L/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.08104,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1808.08104,,,2888189393,,0,,5

Doward; Diane Whalley; Stephen P. McKenna; David Meads; Sharon A. Cook; PC Langley,"OBJECTIVE: The Recurrent Genital Herpes Quality of Life questionnaire (RGHQoL) is a needs-based quality of life (QoL) instrument specifically for use with recurrent genital herpes (RGH). It has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties. However, it cannot currently be used in the calculation of utility for economic analyses. Existing utility instruments cover symptoms and functioning, rather than QoL. Concern has been expressed over their relevance for RGH and, consequently, their ability to show differences between interventions. The aim of this project is to explore the potential for using the RGHQoL to produce meaningful utility scores. The first stage was to investigate whether a preference elicitation exercise was required or whether RGHQoL responses could be incorporated directly into utility analyses. This paper presents findings from the first stage.; ; METHODS: Structured interviews were conducted with 100 RGH patients. Patients undertook preference exercises (paired comparison and ranking) with six RGHQoL items and completed the RGHQoL. Thurstone’s law of comparative judgement was used to calculate item preference weights. These were compared with item severity weights derived via application of the Rasch model to RGHQoL responses.; ; RESULTS: Item ordering of severity was: B-E-D-C-A-F (paired comparisons), B-C-D-E-A-F (ranking) and F-A-DC-E-B (Rasch severity). The paired comparisons and ranking exercises resulted in different ordering of some items, even though the methods are considered direct alternatives for eliciting preference information. The Rasch severity and preference weights provided very different orderings. For example, the most severe item according to patients’ responses to the RGHQoL was judged the least severe in the paired comparison and ranking situations.; ; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that individuals’ ratings of what would have the most impact on them are very different from what actually has an impact. RGHQoL responses cannot be used directly in place of preference elicitation.",4,6,447,,Rasch model; Quality of life; Structured interview; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Ranking; Operations management; Psychological intervention; Judgement; Preference elicitation; Clinical psychology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301511716023 http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/12203/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82017002.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1098-3015(11)71602-3,,10.1016/s1098-3015(11)71602-3,2087037206,,0,,0

The purpose of this cross-sectional, community-based survey was to examine how experiences with breast cancer, knowledge of risk factors, and specific heuristics inform risk judgments for oneself, for friends/peers, and comparative judgments for breast cancer (risk friends/peers - risk self). We recruited an English-speaking, multicultural (57% nonwhite) sample of 184 middle-aged (47 + or - 12 years old), well-educated women. Fifty percent of participants perceived that their breast cancer risk was the same as the risk of their friends/peers; 10% were pessimistic (risk friends/peers - risk self 0). Family history of breast cancer and worry informed risk judgments for oneself. The availability and cultural heuristics specific for black women informed risk judgments for friends/peers. Knowledge of risk factors and interactions of knowledge with the availability, representativeness, and simulation heuristics informed comparative judgments (risk friends/peers - risk self). We discuss cognitive mechanisms with which experiences, knowledge, and heuristics influence comparative breast cancer risk judgments.

One of the critical steps in this endeavour is the selection of an offshore supplier among many potential alternatives. Therefore, the offshore supplier selection decision has emerged as an important aspect of strategic alliance formation. Given the multi-criteria nature of the offshore supplier selection decision, this article proposed a comprehensive problem definition hierarchy highlighting the key elements criteria at its various levels based on a thorough study and analysis of the existing literature on IT outsourcing ITO industry. A data collection instrument is designed to capture comparative judgements from Indian practitioners on relative importance of each element in the hierarchy. Analytic hierarchy process AHP is applied to synthesise the captured data to get the normalised weights of these criteria. Lowest level criteria are eventually used to rank three suppliers to test the veracity of the proposed hierarchy.

To explore their potential contributions to higher cognitive functions, we used a novel task with tachistoscopically presented (for 150 ms) pairs of meaningless figures. Healthy right-handed men judged the similarities and dissimilarities between the two figures on a visual analogue scale (VAS) in two separate runs. In a double-blind, between-subjects design, subjects were administered intravenously either 0.2-mg/kg naloxone or placebo 10 min prior to the task, and VAS judgments and response latencies were measured. We found a significant interaction between substance group and type of judgment: The magnitude of the similarity judgments was lower in the naloxone than in the placebo group, while dissimilarity judgments remained uninfluenced by the treatment. Reaction latencies and mood scores, assessed before and after substance administration, did not differ between the two groups, indicating that the findings did not rely on altered motor performance or motivation. We suggest that naloxone decreased the “similarity criterion” in comparative judgments, indicating its potentially modulatory effect on visual cognition.

This alteration is produced by the activation of the optimistic bias characterized by a set of the unrealistic beliefs compared to the outcomes of their behavior. This bias exposes individuals to adopt lifestyles potentially dangerous for their health, underestimate the risks and overestimate the immediate positive effects. Objectives: This study aimed to analyze the relationship between optimistic bias and smoking habits. In particular, it was hypothesized that smokers develop optimistic illusions, able to facilitate the adoption and the maintenance over time of the unhealthy lifestyles, such as cigarette smoking, and the former smokers could acquire a belief system centered on own responsibility. Patients and Methods: The samples (n = 633, female = 345, male = 288) composed of smokers (35.7%), ex-smokers (32.2%) and nonsmokers (32.1%). Each participant filled out two questionnaires including The Fagerstrom test and the motivational questionnaire as well as a set of items measured on a Likert scales to evaluate health beliefs. Results: The results confirmed the presence of the optimistic bias in comparative judgments, and the attitude to overestimate the effectiveness of their preventive behaviors in the smokers. Conclusions: Cognitive bias in risk perception may influence health behaviors in negative way and reinforce cigarette smoking over the time.

At issue is the extent to which political theorizing is a practical endeavor and, consequently, the extent to which real-world facts should either be factored into political theorizing or else be assumed away.</p>;                <p>The distinction between ideal theory and nonideal theory was first introduced by John Rawls in his classic <italic>A Theory of Justice</italic>. Rawls’s ideal theory is an account of the society we should aim for, given certain facts about human nature and possible social institutions, and involves two central assumptions. First, it assumes full compliance of relevant agents with the demands of justice. Second, it assumes that historical and natural conditions of society are reasonably favorable. These two assumptions are individually necessary and jointly sufficient for his ideal theory. For Rawls, nonideal theory primarily addresses the question of how the ideal might be achieved in practical, permissible steps, from the actual, partially just society we occupy.</p>;                <p>The account of ideal and nonideal theory advanced by Rawls has been subject to criticism from different directions. Amartya Sen accepts Rawls’s distinction between ideal and nonideal theory but argues that Rawlsian-style nonideal theory is too ideal. Given the many and severe injustices we face we do not need to know what ideal (or “transcendental”) justice looks like; our focus should not be on how to transition toward this ideal. Instead, the advancement of justice requires a comparative judgment which ranks possible policies in terms of being more or less just than the status quo. G. A. Cohen, by contrast, argues that Rawlsian-style ideal theory is not really ideal theory as such, but instead principles for regulating society. Our beliefs about normative principles should, ultimately, be insensitive to matters of empirical fact; genuine ideal theory is a form of moral epistemology (an exercise of identifying normative truths).</p>",,,,,Epistemology; Philosophy; Ideal theory; Political philosophy,,,,,https://oxfordre.com/politics/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228637-e-1383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1383,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228637.013.1383,3081769369,,0,,0

Petrusic,"In one condition, positive and negative number pairs were compared in separate blocks of trials. In another condition, the positive and the negative number pairs were intermixed. In the intermixed condition, comparisons involving negative numbers were faster with the left hand than with the right, and comparisons were faster with the right hand than with the left hand with the positive numbers; that is, a spatial numerical association of response codes (SNARC) effect was obtained, in which the mental number line was extended leftward with the negative numbers. On the other hand, in the blocked condition, a reverse SNARC effect was obtained with the negative numbers; that is, negative number pairs have the same underlying spatial representation as the positive numbers in this context. Nongraded semantic congruity effects, obtained in both the blocked and the intermixed conditions, are consistent with the idea that magnitude information is extracted prior to the generation of discrete semantic codes.",12,5,931,937,Psychology; Negative number; Cognitive psychology; Spatial representation; Mental number line; Magnitude (mathematics); Social psychology; Mental representation; Correlation and dependence,,Affect; Humans; Judgment; Mathematics; Reaction Time; Visual Perception,,,https://paperity.org/p/10325548/on-the-mental-representation-of-negative-numbers-context-dependent-snarc-effects-with https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-981056091/on-the-mental-representation-of-negative-numbers http://www.springerlink.com/index/10.3758/BF03196788 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16524013 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03196788 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03196788.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03196788,16524013,10.3758/bf03196788,2018126171,,0,005-374-265-419-666; 009-236-177-112-760; 009-804-637-120-597; 012-386-984-787-272; 015-012-693-948-294; 025-957-847-646-05X; 029-915-293-337-721; 035-552-279-767-677; 073-989-930-529-45X; 084-421-364-199-245; 092-715-514-577-680; 128-909-793-351-309; 144-747-377-111-26X; 153-174-100-314-196,67

Or more effective? Or just better? And if many judges agree that the same one is better, isn’t that the best evidence for validity we could ask for? This paper describes progress in applying comparative judgement (first reported to IAEA in 2004) to the assessment of holistic traits like overall achievement, including effectivenes, quality and creativity. Marking was invented (in Cambridge) during the 18th century enlightment, not in pursuit of validity or even reliability but to overcome serious problems of bias and prejudice in the examinations of the day. Its unintended consequence has been a most serious loss of validity in most of our formal assessments. Some progress has been made in abolishing marksism in UK assessment. A web-based system has been developed for presenting pairs of ‘scripts’ and collecting judgements, and the estimation procedure has been shown to be remarkably robust with the extremely sparse data ‘matrices’ that result. A simple initiation algorithm has been used developed. Some technical aspects of the procedure are described, and a procedure for qualitative description of the scalel for public use id described.",,,,,Prejudice (legal term); Creativity; Cognitive psychology; Public use; Judgement; Best evidence; Computer science; Scripting language; Ask price,,,,,http://www.iaea.info/documents/paper_4d527d4e.pdf,http://www.iaea.info/documents/paper_4d527d4e.pdf,,,2183239037,,0,007-329-931-054-508; 029-742-013-802-885; 062-761-581-145-860; 081-706-627-783-516; 091-666-780-893-50X; 132-949-076-350-478; 135-138-028-187-899; 182-352-858-647-024; 196-395-556-771-386,2

A contributory factor to this situation is the need for student work to be marked reliably by a large number of markers of varied experience and competence. We report a study that tested an alternative approach to assessment, called comparative judgement, which may represent a superior method for assessing open-ended questions that encourage a range of unpredictable responses. An innovative problem solving examination paper was specially designed by examiners, evaluated by mathematics teachers, and administered to 750 secondary school students of varied mathematical achievement. The students’ work was then assessed by mathematics education experts using comparative judgement as well as a specially designed, resource-intensive marking procedure. We report two main findings from the research. First, the examination paper writers, when freed from the traditional constraint of producing a mark scheme, designed questions that were less structured and more problem-based than is typical in current school mathematics examination papers. Second, the comparative judgement approach to assessing the student work proved successful by our measures of inter-rater reliability and validity. These findings open new avenues for how school mathematics, and indeed other areas of the curriculum, might be assessed in the future.",89,3,337,355,Competence (human resources); Grading (education); Mathematics education; Psychology; Judgement; Alternative assessment; Mathematical achievement; Contributory factor; Curriculum; Inter-rater reliability,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/The_problem_of_assessing_problem_solving_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9368165 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1063770 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10649-015-9607-1 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1 https://core.ac.uk/display/42481600 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42481600.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1,,10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1,847524857,,0,009-040-865-972-962; 009-486-832-701-513; 011-160-890-327-445; 014-392-940-528-758; 015-610-828-146-943; 017-792-980-099-478; 018-682-624-707-990; 020-705-299-726-856; 026-164-384-416-667; 028-156-191-431-484; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-359-405-244-950; 044-803-196-956-309; 047-593-198-756-593; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 048-799-681-315-43X; 051-333-856-176-237; 051-426-516-197-907; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 070-361-353-936-043; 073-315-773-701-875; 079-541-121-124-826; 082-657-515-340-970; 088-812-912-022-656; 090-072-397-423-703; 099-957-854-253-785; 100-687-607-260-140; 102-955-514-174-383; 103-363-666-097-871; 106-532-502-155-602; 107-790-959-417-375; 121-019-778-501-955; 130-423-056-479-881; 131-849-599-517-076; 142-199-023-707-579; 146-286-866-668-740; 149-611-039-927-337; 154-724-624-625-585; 155-651-604-500-728; 159-833-656-458-528; 164-086-224-126-233; 168-390-137-537-685; 168-704-895-296-891; 172-081-104-965-398; 173-524-720-434-335; 175-755-079-554-999; 176-786-786-040-880; 179-726-268-053-176; 182-789-160-159-32X; 187-070-003-592-896,19

Subjects memorized an ordered series of names and were tested on their memory of the order with a comparative judgment task. In Experiment 1, a traditional comparative judgment task was used in which they chose the one member in a pair that was either higher or lower in the ranking on the attribute dimension. The 3 typical effects from comparative judgment for serial items--the bowed serial position function, the distance effect, and the congruity effect--were obtained. In Experiment 2, subjects were instructed to choose the item either closer to or farther from the middle reference point of the series. Remarkably different forms of the 3 effects were obtained. Most notable was a deep drop in the middle of the RT function, supporting the activation gradient hypothesis but further separating the role of the reference point from that of the endpoints in the assumption of the activation strength gradient theories. The findings also generalized the concept of each of these 3 effects.",123,2,127,136,Serial position effect; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Ranking; Extramural; Reference Point; Distance effect; Serial learning; Anchor point; Verbal learning; Social psychology,,"Attention; Humans; Judgment; Memory, Short-Term; Reaction Time; Retention, Psychology; Serial Learning; Verbal Learning",,PHS HHS (516393) United States,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20518431 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20518431/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.2.0127 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20518431 https://wwsw.vietsciences.org/research/056/495/056495094.php,http://dx.doi.org/10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.2.0127,20518431,10.5406/amerjpsyc.123.2.0127,2403363665,,0,000-691-761-942-832; 002-287-259-826-156; 009-351-777-389-759; 011-060-968-966-450; 013-209-296-309-874; 014-171-475-020-617; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-000-197-860-064; 021-377-820-314-868; 024-119-020-242-912; 027-957-537-714-574; 037-379-498-186-385; 041-100-409-785-743; 042-974-807-587-578; 045-179-545-761-535; 058-571-827-675-115; 061-556-739-571-730; 068-691-637-820-536; 084-277-600-615-738; 088-555-553-457-409; 109-926-662-069-886; 112-951-625-047-533; 113-665-629-315-16X; 124-257-870-583-335; 156-762-273-363-770; 167-388-826-583-987; 175-397-495-157-485; 176-017-510-665-867; 177-015-691-281-199; 177-226-574-421-404,8

Typically, it is assumed in the Item Response Theory (IRT) that latent variables are related to the observed responses through continuous normal or logistic functions, determining the probability with which one of the ordered response alternatives on a Likert-scale item is chosen. Based on an analysis of 1,731 self- and other-rated responses on the 240 NEO PI-3 questionnaire items, it was proposed that a viable alternative is a finite number of latent events which are related to manifest responses through a binomial function which has only one parameter – the probability with which a given statement is approved. For the majority of items, the best fit was obtained with a mixed-binomial distribution, which assumes two different subpopulations who endorse items with two different probabilities. It was shown that the fit of the binomial IRT model can be improved by assuming that about 10% of random noise is contained in the answers and by taking into account response biases towards one of the response categories. It was concluded that the binomial response model for the measurement of personality traits may be a workable alternative to the more habitual normal and logistic IRT models.",5,,371,371,Statistics; Binomial regression; Psychology; Measurement invariance; Response bias; Logistic function; Personality; Item response theory; Binomial distribution; Latent variable; Social psychology,Likert-scale; NEO Personality Inventory; measurement invariance; mixed-binomial model; personality measurement models; response bias; self- and observer-ratings,,,,http://psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik_Mixed-binomial-model_Frontiers-in-Psychology2014.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00371/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82881664 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00371/abstract http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24847291 https://doaj.org/article/5886e2ce39ae4e3d9eeb911a4a333729 http://sys130.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik_Mixed-binomial-model_Frontiers-in-Psychology2014.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4023022 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4023022/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82881664.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00371,24847291,10.3389/fpsyg.2014.00371,2053928434,PMC4023022,0,000-604-921-995-047; 000-879-311-407-650; 001-646-145-309-498; 002-080-623-127-178; 004-316-094-057-581; 005-568-453-242-592; 006-719-479-673-114; 006-741-523-421-282; 006-804-015-108-025; 010-099-397-086-59X; 010-357-896-205-898; 010-622-459-055-46X; 011-685-532-630-358; 012-604-847-847-665; 015-190-959-187-819; 015-364-781-321-626; 020-163-368-230-456; 023-450-650-144-536; 023-454-957-182-850; 024-879-193-797-037; 025-080-508-059-32X; 025-102-065-625-904; 025-361-109-563-300; 028-552-349-172-297; 032-615-740-393-092; 032-845-429-371-708; 034-798-119-469-535; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-218-452-622-854; 037-400-735-650-65X; 039-234-740-047-849; 042-006-908-393-029; 043-819-305-097-700; 044-327-359-551-134; 046-791-819-525-618; 050-142-758-841-055; 052-032-175-309-572; 054-867-233-579-414; 056-274-151-269-286; 060-829-769-823-42X; 061-580-797-045-19X; 061-745-763-274-907; 063-863-517-456-537; 065-556-929-551-680; 066-370-408-763-881; 072-755-765-192-751; 072-890-616-337-496; 076-486-257-519-79X; 079-336-624-787-32X; 080-835-438-172-884; 081-705-256-375-446; 083-134-788-298-804; 084-239-202-807-200; 086-426-849-326-471; 094-965-707-214-805; 095-272-963-302-374; 096-485-515-631-559; 098-495-629-156-719; 102-475-806-067-907; 102-741-469-072-084; 103-612-219-014-557; 106-069-010-763-247; 128-032-031-708-238; 147-514-034-059-262; 167-414-539-807-833; 172-572-166-912-802; 175-813-154-265-365; 187-635-463-174-412,9

Using Comparative Judgement for Reliable Briefing Paper Assessment in Simulation Games,2018-03-06,2018,book chapter,Simulations of Decision-Making as Active Learning Tools,22105549; 22105557,Springer International Publishing,,Pierpaolo Settembri; Roos Van Gasse; Liesje Coertjens; Sven De Maeyer,"Achieving a fair and rigorous assessment of participants in simulation games represents a major challenge. Not only does the difficulty apply to the actual negotiation part, but it also extends to the written assignments that typically accompany a simulation. For one thing, if different raters are involved, it is important to assure that differences in severity do not affect the grades. Recently, comparative judgement (CJ) has been introduced as a method allowing for a team-based grading. This chapter discusses in particular the potential of comparative judgement for assessing briefing papers from 84 students. Four assessors completed 622 comparisons in the Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) tool. Results indicate a reliability level of 0.71 for the final rank order, which had demanded a time investment around 10.5 h from the team of assessors. Next to this, there was no evidence of bias towards the most important roles in the simulation game. The study also details how the obtained rank orders were translated into grades, ranging from 11 to 17 out of 20. These elements showcase CJ’s advantage in reaching adequate reliability levels for briefing papers in an efficient manner.",,,93,108,Competence (human resources); Engineering management; Grading (education); Ranking; Negotiation; Judgement; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:197002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8,,10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8,2789394434,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 043-993-488-611-488; 045-320-167-026-428; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 074-693-792-478-319; 077-950-549-589-039; 101-970-162-694-164; 107-790-959-417-375; 130-140-615-234-208; 141-811-530-730-484; 145-410-732-577-674; 165-389-321-547-720; 177-072-688-486-223,1

Ranking tasks are a novel form of conceptual exercise in which students are presented with (usually) pictures or diagrams that describe up to six slightly different variations of a basic physical situation. Students are then asked to make a comparative judgment identifying the order or ranking of the various situations based on some physical outcome or result. These exercises are easily incorporated as collaborative group activities into the traditional lecture-based classroom. This study developed design guidelines for ranking tasks based on several learning theories and classroom pilot studies. A single-group repeated measures experiment was then conducted using eight key introductory astronomy topics with 250 students at the University of Arizona in the Fall of 2004. Our research questions were: • Do in-class collaborative ranking task exercises result in student conceptual gains when incorporated into traditional lecture-based instruction? Are these gains significant in terms of effect size measures commonly used in education research? • What value do students perceive in the use of in-class ranking tasks exercises? The study found that average assessment test scores across the eight astronomy topics increased from 32% on the start-of-semester pretest to 61% after traditional lecture, to 77% after the ranking task exercises. A mixed factors ANOVA confirmed a significant rise in test scores after the ranking tasks (alpha = 0.05). The average normalized gain on the post-ranking task tests was 0.41, with a Cohenis d effect size of 0.62 which is described in the literature as moderately large. Interestingly, we found that the normalized gain from the ranking tasks was equal to the entire previous gain from traditional instruction. A repeated-factor ANOVA found that the use of ranking tasks equally benefited both genders and also both high and low-scoring median groups on the pretest. A Lickert-scale attitude survey found that 83% of the students participating in the 16 week study believed that the ranking task exercises helped their understanding of core astronomy concepts. Based on these results, we assert that adding collaborative ranking task exercises to a traditional classroom instruction can significantly improve student understanding of key introductory astronomy concepts.",,,,,Repeated measures design; Astronomy; Mathematics education; Ranking; Collaborative group; Curriculum material; Research questions; Traditional classroom; Computer science; Learning theory,,,,,http://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/1231,http://uir.unisa.ac.za/handle/10500/1231,,,2118352813,,0,000-247-626-578-547; 001-213-392-348-853; 001-273-577-857-35X; 001-276-305-382-69X; 002-025-762-587-201; 002-161-511-517-950; 002-374-833-010-65X; 003-943-254-692-776; 004-087-562-693-313; 006-449-318-965-821; 006-707-008-945-832; 006-778-521-790-323; 007-712-324-535-168; 008-520-776-092-37X; 010-000-069-157-616; 010-319-611-530-455; 010-423-006-392-744; 012-139-475-512-58X; 012-884-078-886-836; 013-331-505-668-726; 013-592-565-693-574; 016-191-740-851-333; 018-302-237-621-671; 018-338-915-841-062; 019-789-882-526-451; 020-475-699-565-659; 021-075-194-055-964; 022-438-425-940-458; 022-668-251-710-161; 022-894-105-091-337; 023-338-358-902-23X; 024-163-850-821-866; 024-534-718-268-40X; 026-125-244-047-706; 030-548-054-254-324; 031-243-846-426-314; 035-064-766-249-225; 035-238-645-441-103; 036-074-479-228-910; 036-096-401-333-080; 038-120-198-291-355; 038-366-168-730-820; 038-738-958-056-88X; 039-124-628-362-059; 042-356-651-128-675; 043-885-601-678-986; 044-567-022-779-005; 046-138-168-425-952; 047-169-043-827-315; 048-584-692-370-241; 053-417-073-682-767; 053-493-938-752-619; 055-286-818-748-675; 056-081-120-860-339; 057-404-799-458-169; 057-431-244-173-315; 057-532-674-774-121; 057-987-955-249-463; 058-676-044-458-625; 060-002-930-115-724; 061-567-498-532-768; 061-928-852-602-804; 062-676-735-103-836; 063-359-503-975-827; 064-639-270-076-726; 065-667-397-784-169; 066-388-453-912-511; 067-066-257-426-617; 067-583-875-138-386; 067-799-974-932-959; 067-966-017-115-426; 068-524-519-431-486; 068-662-625-414-976; 069-082-715-910-397; 070-150-617-425-328; 072-003-725-051-936; 073-109-923-863-689; 074-297-689-940-97X; 074-810-344-813-494; 075-868-905-364-894; 077-870-133-473-091; 079-471-812-086-952; 081-559-992-630-051; 082-477-617-562-832; 084-236-128-182-56X; 086-027-525-461-687; 087-641-294-253-835; 088-904-800-541-96X; 093-394-582-329-867; 094-786-100-395-415; 095-187-579-945-192; 098-421-902-248-170; 100-432-363-332-739; 102-595-763-290-039; 103-590-935-771-992; 107-467-942-182-952; 109-440-047-650-353; 110-539-462-734-875; 111-778-683-541-107; 111-797-479-450-72X; 114-665-347-625-879; 114-751-080-224-291; 115-048-509-763-725; 115-174-428-198-91X; 115-550-722-655-911; 116-177-954-093-667; 117-659-683-526-173; 119-201-276-185-891; 119-327-308-047-332; 119-902-767-883-944; 121-060-986-206-875; 126-929-902-884-418; 132-928-676-561-954; 139-801-751-051-564; 140-720-273-354-093; 143-709-380-560-02X; 147-403-393-052-351; 148-496-583-551-743; 148-683-536-416-884; 150-092-165-173-728; 153-726-731-458-236; 157-905-744-224-243; 159-213-778-019-868; 160-695-841-801-271; 160-863-766-585-790; 160-871-603-527-641; 162-156-897-645-669; 169-088-367-112-147; 172-573-079-472-196; 177-051-788-964-007,0

Filimonov,"The objective of the paper is to lay down a foundation for imprecise system reliability assessments based on coherent imprecise probabilities that are a particular case of coherent imprecise previsions. Previous attempts of wide implementation of other theories of imprecise probabilities in reliability analyses have not succeeded. The recent theory of coherent imprecise previsions appeared to be a promising tool for reliability and risk assessments and to be devoid of the drawbacks of its predecessors. This paper describes an approach to how the coherent imprecise reliabilities of series and parallel systems can be calculated. A set of theorems is proven to allow the calculation of the imprecise reliability of a system of an arbitrary structure, in particular with fault trees.

Craig; Roger P. Rhodes; Gregory O. Gibson; Sliman J. Bensmaia,"The ability to discriminate a smooth surface from a grooved one depends on several variables, including the width of the grooves and the force with which the skin is contacted. It has been hypothesized that this smooth–grooved discrimination with statically presented stimuli is based on intensity cues, namely, the overall difference in perceived intensity between the smooth and grooved surfaces. To test this hypothesis, the perceived intensities of test stimuli were varied on a trial-by-trial basis by varying the depth of penetration the contactor was allowed to travel into the skin. As compared to a control condition in which stimuli were presented with the same average penetration and contrary to the hypothesis, random variations in penetration produced no decline in smooth–grooved performance. The total amount of conformance was an accurate predictor of sensitivity across various penetrations and across two test sites (distal finger pad and finger base). It appears that subjects are making absolute rather than comparative judgments in the smooth–grooved task.

However, the neural correlates of how these two types of processes operate during value-based decision-making remain unclear. In this study, we investigated the extent to which neural regions engaged during value-based decision-making overlap with those engaged during mathematical and emotional processing in a within-subject manner. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, participants viewed stimuli that always consisted of numbers and emotional faces that depicted two choices. Across tasks, participants decided between the two choices based on the expected value of the numbers, a mathematical result of the numbers, or the emotional face stimuli. We found that all three tasks commonly involved various cortical areas including frontal, parietal, motor, somatosensory, and visual regions. Critically, the mathematical task shared common areas with the value but not emotion task in bilateral striatum. Although the emotion task overlapped with the value task in parietal, motor, and sensory areas, the mathematical task also evoked responses in other areas within these same cortical structures. Minimal areas were uniquely engaged for the value task apart from the other two tasks. The emotion task elicited a more expansive area of neural activity whereas value and mathematical task responses were in more focal regions. Whole-brain spatial correlation analysis showed that valuative processing engaged functional brain responses more similarly to mathematical processing than emotional processing. While decisions on expected value entail both mathematical and emotional processing regions, mathematical processes have a more prominent contribution particularly in subcortical processes.",10,,275,275,Neural correlates of consciousness; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Somatosensory system; Cognitive neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Affect (psychology); Sensory system,arithmetic processing; cognitive neuroscience; decision-making; emotion; fMRI,,,"Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan; Ministry of Science and Technology, Taiwan",http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27375466 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275/abstract https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27375466 https://philpapers.org/rec/HSUDAO https://pearl.plymouth.ac.uk/handle/10026.1/12549 https://core.ac.uk/display/82832908 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82832908.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275,27375466,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00275,2416915192,PMC4901075,0,005-739-387-717-10X; 005-816-433-292-998; 005-875-269-720-144; 007-789-401-265-006; 011-932-328-023-425; 015-561-972-404-400; 018-575-808-831-538; 019-848-180-073-248; 025-842-719-023-536; 027-125-835-084-679; 029-158-532-067-488; 031-164-280-946-058; 035-583-235-210-019; 037-559-042-610-406; 037-815-043-351-514; 046-879-729-185-863; 050-621-764-264-109; 053-066-254-713-444; 056-672-370-150-588; 058-049-644-454-692; 062-738-367-496-162; 069-548-364-501-728; 076-709-442-467-974; 077-873-002-983-255; 081-566-220-895-223; 083-552-421-836-268; 084-488-285-659-756; 089-070-517-657-148; 090-653-340-211-991; 094-434-050-281-778; 099-884-124-906-25X; 100-884-569-161-91X; 102-584-847-130-426; 105-165-149-930-509; 106-871-723-406-846; 135-236-489-390-979; 152-174-353-239-140; 155-419-047-371-743; 194-402-936-894-732,2

By far most of the study has been based on a single view. Selecting Confucius Temple-Qinhuai River Scenic Area in Nanjing as the typical case of urban traditional and cultural tourism destination, this paper made an empirical analysis of the characteristics and law of the coupling between the landscape pattern and landscape aesthetic by using the landscape pattern index as the criterion of ecological beauty as well as the Balanced Incomplete Block-Law of Comparative Judgement as the criterion of landscape beauty. The results displayed: 1) The overall landscape fragmentation of the studied area was rather high, but different parts of landscape were influenced differently by artificial factors. The diversity and heterogeneity of landscape patches were moderate, but there were structural differences of the area of patch, spatial distribution and spatial agglomeration degree. 2) The tourists and local residents had good perception of landscape aesthetic of the scenic area, however, they had preference forthe historical architecture and cultural landscape with abundant elements of city memory. 3) As a whole, the relationship between the landscape pattern and landscape aesthetic was coupled and complementary. Confucius Temple-Qinhuai River Scenic Area had profound history and culture, however, under the background of the rapid development of urbanization, cultural characteristics were missing constantly and the process of delocalization was speeded up. Hence, it would be a long way to go to protect city memory and inherit local culture for the scenic area, which is an important traditional and cultural tourism destination of the city.",,,,,Environmental resource management; Landscape design; Architecture; Cultural landscape; Landscape archaeology; Geography; Judgement; Cultural tourism; Beauty; Urbanization; Cartography,,,,,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-RDDD201506018.htm,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-RDDD201506018.htm,,,2361661726,,0,,0

The data generation process was based on a Delphi study involving 55 experts from PA, IS/IT industry, and academy. A set of 31 forces were identified and ranked based on the level of importance they assume in IS interoperability initiatives. Thirty eight propositions describing restraining and driving influences were also formulated, as well as 24 propositions about forces' configuration in the current context of Portuguese PA that represent the specific constellation of forces acting in IS interoperability initiatives in that country.

M. Krabbe,"BACKGROUND: Many objective health outcome measures are used to monitor patients or evaluate health interventions, but there are also subjective measures. For the latter, it is difficult to derive metric data, which are needed to quantify health outcomes such as functional disability, severity of side effects, and health status. OBJECTIVE: Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment is presented as an alternative means to derive metric values for subjective health outcomes. The appeal of Thurstone's scaling model is that it can transform subjective individual rank order data or comparative preference data to a single group composite interval scale. To demonstrate its contribution, an empirical study was conducted, focusing on the valuation of health states. RESEARCH DESIGN: Rank order data were collected for 18 health states and were then used as input for Thurstone scaling. Visual analogue scale (VAS) values were also collected for the same states. SUBJECTS: An agency for market research recruited 212 Dutch respondents aged 18-75 years. RESULTS: The derived Thurstone values showed a strong relationship with the VAS values. The positions of the 2 worst states were almost identical on the VAS and the Thurstone scale. Intermediate states were scaled somewhat differently by the 2 methods. CONCLUSIONS: For many subjective health outcomes, Thurstone scaling and its derivatives may be an attractive methodology to arrive at quantitative measures.",46,4,357,365,Statistics; Empirical research; Visual analogue scale; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Law of comparative judgment; Ranking; EQ-5D; Research design; Interval Scale,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Decision Making; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Severity of Illness Index",,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Paul_Krabbe/publication/5489213_Thurstone_scaling_as_a_measurement_method_to_quantify_subjective_health_outcomes/links/0deec5185193e3b071000000.pdf https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/thurstone-scaling-as-a-measurement-method-to-quantify-subjective-health-outcomes(434130d4-f321-496c-85ac-17022f595cf5).html https://www.jstor.org/stable/40221669 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/70602 http://www.theta-research.nl/Files/Publications/Methodology/2008a%20Krabbe.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18362814 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F434130d4-f321-496c-85ac-17022f595cf5,http://dx.doi.org/10.1097/mlr.0b013e31815ceca9,18362814,10.1097/mlr.0b013e31815ceca9,2094960773,,0,006-865-116-408-392; 009-577-577-067-749; 011-105-391-999-886; 011-388-207-153-534; 011-741-501-425-857; 012-910-988-487-056; 013-317-350-622-019; 013-718-423-316-272; 015-856-549-784-635; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 022-166-355-822-061; 024-848-286-367-819; 027-583-691-053-31X; 033-172-725-147-949; 035-252-253-486-071; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-570-923-741-223; 042-262-850-601-237; 045-627-738-023-711; 048-307-845-554-522; 050-943-988-713-681; 057-657-809-679-383; 061-869-815-688-55X; 062-783-280-287-096; 065-906-991-595-286; 070-210-283-045-748; 074-069-533-445-505; 076-578-352-137-181; 077-457-454-976-635; 078-716-982-725-928; 085-138-376-626-614; 086-286-587-721-700; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-456-639-648-372; 089-468-883-189-639; 090-664-267-036-093; 092-474-419-202-077; 100-660-177-576-507; 101-859-521-070-05X; 105-061-537-103-242; 113-278-954-446-219; 113-286-538-807-265; 114-878-071-598-441; 115-267-489-063-51X; 120-080-285-932-016; 122-894-465-380-883; 125-991-149-017-306; 158-478-852-505-571,46

Since the Dutch DCE was carried out right after the 2006 health reform, which made citizens explicitly choose a health insurance contract, two research questions naturally arise. First, are the preferences with regard to contract attributes (such as Managed Care-type restrictions of physician choice), incentives (such as bonus options for no claims, deductibles, and a bonus for preventive behavior), and extra services provided by the health insurer (such as patient counseling) similar between the two countries? Second, was the requirement to explicitly choose imposed by the Dutch government in the context of the reform effective in reducing status quo bias with respect to future reforms?",4,1,22,22,Public economics; Status quo bias; Public health; Government; Actuarial science; Economics; Public finance; Willingness to pay; Health services research; Incentive; Health economics,Discrete choice experiments; Germany; Health insurance; Health reform; Netherlands; Preference measurement,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6 https://paperity.org/p/49481156/preferences-for-health-insurance-in-germany-and-the-netherlands-a-tale-of-two-countries https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51786/ https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/76181 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209455/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4209455 https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51786/1/wp1002.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/display/81285811 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80046872.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6,25386387,10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6,2151348462,PMC4209455,0,002-043-987-338-109; 004-895-319-909-247; 005-290-905-754-326; 005-329-717-933-787; 005-773-562-974-074; 007-484-909-003-94X; 010-195-457-296-442; 012-277-806-980-851; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-141-612-502-359; 044-511-676-188-586; 048-851-838-521-65X; 057-657-809-679-383; 062-783-280-287-096; 071-235-999-619-556; 089-468-883-189-639; 098-376-587-660-420; 102-325-899-749-961; 114-258-605-734-050; 123-840-986-289-076; 143-009-584-641-131; 160-441-821-953-411; 179-729-699-068-218; 186-963-949-309-408,16

Carroll; Jodi Grace; Meredith Terry,"We review explanations offered by researchers for optimism in comparative risk judgments – the belief that one is at lower risk than other people for negative events. Our review organizes the explanations into four categories. The categories reflect a) the desired end-states of comparative judgments, b) the cognitive processes that guide judgments, c) the information people have or use in making judgments, and d) the underlying affect. For each explanation we review relevant studies. We conclude by discussing whether comparative optimism reflects a distortion in personal risk judgments or judgments of the average person’s risk, by addressing the interplay of the various accounts of comparative optimism, and by discussing directions for future research. Psychics and astrologers sustain a steady business by appealing to people’s desire to predict the future. People want to know whether they will be lucky in love or at risk for cancer or other debilitating illnesses. Yet people are not just interested in how their future will unfold in an absolute sense; they are interested in knowing how their future will compare with that of other people, and for good reason. In a variety of domains (sports competitions, admissions to competitive graduate schools, job promotions), success and failure are defined by how people measure up to others because those others provide a standard against which people can evaluate themselves (Festinger, 1954). Of course, the future is uncertain, and unlike psychics and astrologers, laypeople lack a crystal ball for predicting what lies ahead. They must instead weigh their knowledge of themselves and their knowledge of others to forecast the future. Importantly, over two decades of research on comparative risk judgments suggest that people systematically tip the scale in their own favor, predicting their outcomes will be brighter than that of their peers. Comparative optimism refers to the tendency for people to believe that they are less likely to experience negative",42,1-2,65,98,Psychology; Risk perception; Cognition; Social comparison theory; Optimism; Absolute sense; Normal people; Social psychology,,,,,http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~shepperd/articles/PsychBelgica2002.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-06881-007,http://dx.doi.org/10.5334/pb.986,,10.5334/pb.986,2097629273,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 003-498-762-032-886; 005-823-201-543-853; 006-885-449-253-796; 006-981-763-398-491; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-509-482-154-793; 010-702-659-133-901; 011-060-083-457-739; 011-213-596-160-505; 011-404-001-204-09X; 012-355-710-448-108; 012-804-471-466-632; 014-250-530-986-293; 014-991-812-446-605; 016-610-610-193-073; 019-200-757-553-43X; 019-303-532-604-20X; 019-907-085-939-215; 019-995-576-553-416; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-690-032-055-468; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-733-904-195-585; 022-958-433-256-989; 023-926-631-266-07X; 024-507-594-489-29X; 025-736-055-916-542; 029-966-367-465-348; 031-071-210-276-164; 031-672-019-523-79X; 033-145-626-985-847; 035-294-134-197-096; 035-442-585-497-153; 036-995-718-131-03X; 037-314-974-551-703; 038-173-876-584-341; 038-906-821-424-83X; 040-269-259-341-705; 040-430-654-992-207; 049-229-125-635-709; 051-044-823-993-766; 051-363-655-731-457; 053-738-546-537-648; 054-163-434-118-897; 056-926-960-371-839; 057-900-667-227-636; 059-353-528-548-109; 061-082-122-262-098; 061-142-370-003-855; 061-748-308-588-588; 066-511-998-492-554; 067-748-135-073-399; 070-367-644-537-816; 071-391-575-799-850; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-850-977-359-272; 072-876-017-414-92X; 073-043-961-307-430; 074-062-617-545-851; 074-358-010-155-235; 075-137-770-558-667; 076-391-942-699-520; 078-060-201-696-134; 081-228-381-476-95X; 082-662-120-833-072; 083-128-757-419-377; 088-869-229-566-701; 089-298-837-389-569; 090-023-370-872-145; 092-534-364-737-788; 100-286-395-572-793; 101-474-422-016-915; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 110-167-195-442-258; 111-153-192-923-207; 112-641-597-382-321; 118-700-725-177-580; 123-491-867-509-133; 123-883-329-049-929; 124-354-475-202-859; 133-211-080-914-876; 143-264-338-311-004; 143-527-773-731-849; 148-466-217-179-980; 149-530-137-214-213; 150-007-348-151-864; 150-968-603-215-558; 152-633-318-433-765; 156-695-224-836-175; 156-695-286-452-521; 158-444-232-588-710; 163-569-396-472-394; 164-986-217-754-665; 166-148-082-833-226; 181-166-614-027-51X; 189-439-955-428-647,150

Mistry; Emmanuel M. Pothos; Joachim Vandekerckhove; Jennifer S. Trueblood,"We use quantum probability (QP) theory to investigate individual differences in causal reasoning. By analyzing data sets from Rehder (2014) on comparative judgments, and from Rehder & Waldmann (2016) on absolute judgments, we show that a QP model can both account for individual differences in causal judgments, and why these judgments sometimes violate the properties of causal Bayes nets. We implement this and previously proposed models of causal reasoning (including classical probability models) within the same hierarchical Bayesian inferential framework to provide a detailed comparison between these models, including computing Bayes factors. Analysis of the inferred parameters of the QP model illustrates how these can be interpreted in terms of putative cognitive mechanisms of causal reasoning. Additionally, we implement a latent classification mechanism that identifies subcategories of reasoners based on properties of the inferred cognitive process, rather than post hoc clustering. The QP model also provides a parsimonious explanation for aggregate behavior, which alternatively can only be explained by a mixture of multiple existing models. Investigating individual differences through the lens of a QP model reveals simple but strong alternatives to existing explanations for the dichotomies often observed in how people make causal inferences. These alternative explanations arise from the cognitive interpretation of the parameters and structure of the quantum probability model.",87,,76,97,Bayesian probability; Causal reasoning; Machine learning; Bayes factor; Artificial intelligence; Causal inference; Quantum probability; Cognition; Bayes' theorem; Computer science; Aggregate behavior,,,,"John Templeton Foundation; Leverhulme Trust; Leverhulme Trust; Leverhulme Trust; NSF, United States; NSF, United States; NSF, United States; NSF, United States",https://osf.io/t3h5g/ https://escholarship.org/uc/item/75p411hx https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022249618300051 https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/20381/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmp.2018.09.003,,10.1016/j.jmp.2018.09.003,2898131902,,0,000-417-197-060-668; 000-592-713-829-401; 001-851-267-213-26X; 005-515-909-003-84X; 007-949-338-488-29X; 009-271-375-832-033; 011-093-967-710-067; 014-951-984-774-481; 015-269-196-087-01X; 016-165-358-751-703; 016-906-000-101-429; 017-204-564-104-625; 017-441-708-575-215; 021-161-487-750-734; 022-358-736-211-850; 024-264-463-729-325; 028-290-537-612-635; 030-764-074-660-991; 032-631-501-720-842; 032-837-072-880-365; 034-955-786-295-192; 041-046-954-886-094; 042-249-755-201-538; 042-423-147-359-818; 043-959-028-158-513; 045-528-680-831-99X; 050-526-493-362-464; 051-006-815-865-855; 054-442-408-178-863; 057-915-572-671-47X; 063-163-350-630-021; 065-192-437-670-136; 076-881-474-419-146; 077-798-526-658-018; 078-087-701-081-005; 079-766-080-726-35X; 080-804-345-838-411; 081-066-042-985-929; 088-019-593-897-08X; 092-270-180-947-346; 097-222-159-458-236; 100-131-060-248-223; 102-802-648-527-677; 107-452-632-590-318; 116-005-314-582-189; 122-552-358-518-883; 124-642-704-228-144; 133-131-513-805-190; 143-357-843-212-317; 144-174-681-473-251; 145-974-015-176-185; 158-164-550-472-442; 177-285-718-908-669; 198-900-147-328-065,2

In several WTP studies, stated preference data have been analyzed using Mixed Logit (ML) model specification. In ML models, it is necessary to make an assumption regarding the distribution of random parameters. Researchers have developed ML models with different distributional assumptions of random parameters. However, the effect of distributional assumptions of random parameters in ML model on goodness-of-fit and WTP values has not been studied adequately. In the present work, an investigation is carried out in this regard taking reference to a case study of feeder service to bus stop in rural India. Various Mixed Logit models were attempted with different distributional assumptions of random parameters such as normal, log normal, triangular, uniform, constrained normal, constrained triangular, constrained uniform, etc. Variation of goodness of fit statistics and WTP values are observed across different ML models. The work indicates the importance of distributional assumption while developing ML model in WTP studies. The work also indicates that it is desirable to develop several ML models with different distributional assumptions and then select the superior one based on goodness of fit statistics.",104,,601,610,Statistics; Specification; Akaike information criterion; Goodness of fit; Econometrics; Log-normal distribution; Economics; Willingness to pay; Random parameters; Preference data; Mixed logit,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81137307 https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=1280020 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281304545X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S187704281304545X https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81137307.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.11.154,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.11.154,2074322062,,0,001-992-051-270-176; 003-189-451-054-886; 012-277-806-980-851; 025-271-819-261-797; 027-589-283-892-728; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-141-612-502-359; 050-773-368-435-749; 051-612-558-466-369; 052-217-341-775-087; 057-657-809-679-383; 071-674-642-056-169; 097-281-101-323-435; 107-789-313-226-600; 108-048-252-357-743; 114-908-938-947-160; 128-315-979-589-27X; 140-949-636-061-376; 149-701-672-874-735; 162-939-248-208-259; 164-260-106-908-120; 184-845-311-102-387,8

The current study was aimed to test whether such a representation could be created even for objects that violate fundamental principles of spatial organization, namely impossible objects. Previous studies argued that these objects cannot be represented holistically in long-term memory because they lack coherent 3D structure. Here, we utilized Garner’s speeded classification task to test whether the perception of possible and impossible objects is mediated by similar holistic processing mechanisms. To this end, participants were asked to make speeded classifications of one object dimension while an irrelevant dimension was kept constant (baseline condition) or when this dimension varied (filtering condition). It is well accepted that ignoring the irrelevant dimension is impossible when holistic perception is mandatory, thus the extent of Garner interference in performance between the baseline and filtering conditions serves as an index of holistic processing. Critically, in Experiment 1, similar levels of Garner interference were found for possible and impossible objects implying holistic perception of both object types. Experiment 2 extended these results and demonstrated that even when depth information was explicitly processed, participants were still unable to process one dimension (width/depth) while ignoring the irrelevant dimension (depth/width, respectively). The results of Experiment 3 replicated the basic pattern found in Experiments 1 and 2 using a novel set of object exemplars. In Experiment 4, we used possible and impossible versions of the Penrose triangles in which information about impossibility is embedded in the internal elements of the objects which participant were explicitly asked to judge. As in Experiments 1–3, similar Garner interference was found for possible and impossible objects. Taken together, these findings emphasize the centrality of holistic processing style in object perception and suggest that it applies even for atypical stimuli such as impossible objects.",93,,10,18,Filter (signal processing); Spatial organization; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Impossibility; Computer science; Communication; Centrality; Cognitive neuroscience of visual object recognition; Object type; Impossible object,Holistic processing; Impossible objects; Object recognition; Selective attention,"Adult; Analysis of Variance; Attention/physiology; Depth Perception/physiology; Female; Form Perception/physiology; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Recognition, Psychology/physiology; Young Adult",,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913002368#! https://core.ac.uk/display/82346836 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913002368 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913002368 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121070 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82346836.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2013.10.001,24121070,10.1016/j.visres.2013.10.001,2086358801,,0,001-703-454-029-551; 004-482-536-954-815; 005-911-051-524-322; 006-509-176-438-605; 008-704-307-029-18X; 008-749-346-486-091; 009-769-954-782-980; 010-769-206-426-687; 011-585-355-054-012; 012-351-847-638-262; 020-843-611-733-15X; 021-447-708-621-973; 022-884-136-918-916; 028-547-863-731-251; 029-508-198-248-765; 029-695-385-530-818; 032-570-328-224-434; 035-676-863-599-873; 041-058-649-545-240; 045-353-980-648-191; 048-899-315-971-873; 050-080-291-783-11X; 055-024-562-700-87X; 057-097-165-669-995; 057-857-352-024-171; 059-770-874-211-32X; 063-613-578-276-837; 064-425-045-760-069; 065-056-068-237-954; 077-180-506-042-537; 083-665-507-689-714; 084-076-050-569-00X; 088-467-480-843-05X; 094-459-875-746-382; 096-439-593-248-910; 128-076-639-402-346; 150-012-747-893-626; 157-213-220-555-263,9

Cope; Manon Grube; Arnab Mandal; Freya E. Cooper; Una Brechany; David J. Burn; Timothy D. Griffiths,"Bilateral, high-frequency stimulation of the basal ganglia (STN-DBS) is in widespread use for the treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson׳s disease (PD). We present here the first psychophysical investigation of the effect of STN-DBS upon perceptual timing in the hundreds of milliseconds range, with both duration-based (absolute) and beat-based (relative) tasks; 13 patients with PD were assessed with their STN-DBS ‘on’, ‘off’, and then ‘on’ again.; ; Paired parametric analyses revealed no statistically significant differences for any task according to DBS status. We demonstrate, from the examination of confidence intervals, that any functionally relevant effect of STN-DBS on relative perceptual timing is statistically unlikely. For absolute, duration-based timing, we demonstrate that the activation of STN-DBS may either worsen performance or have no effect, but that it is unlikely to lead to significant improvement.; ; Although these results are negative they have important implications for our understanding of perceptual timing and its relationship to motor functions within the timing network of the brain. They imply that the mechanisms involved in the perceptual processing of temporal information are likely to be functionally independent from those that underpin movement. Further, they suggest that the connections between STN and the subtantia nigra and globus pallidus are unlikely to be critical to beat-based perceptual timing.",57,100,29,37,Sensory threshold; Psychology; Neuroscience; Time perception; Perception; Subthalamic nucleus; Basal ganglia; Deep brain stimulation; Parkinson's disease; Globus pallidus,Deep brain stimulation; Parkinson׳s disease; Perceptual timing; Subthalamic nucleus,"Aged; Cerebellum/physiopathology; Deep Brain Stimulation/methods; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Parkinson Disease/therapy; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Signal Detection, Psychological; Subthalamic Nucleus/physiology; Time Factors; Time Perception/physiology",,Wellcome Trust (091593) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (091681) United Kingdom,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000736 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0028393214000736 https://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/203818 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4022837/ http://eprint.ncl.ac.uk/file_store/production/203818/9E1FFF15-CAFE-4D66-AAE3-2CFA2F0FE856.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4022837 https://core.ac.uk/display/82321846 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82321846.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.021,24613477,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2014.02.021,2046009931,PMC4022837,0,000-031-367-034-146; 000-500-849-721-706; 002-549-486-695-114; 004-146-082-292-868; 005-281-876-349-30X; 005-285-622-509-236; 005-608-937-488-613; 006-556-515-196-690; 006-674-467-153-780; 007-292-929-089-350; 007-599-970-098-44X; 007-984-949-991-402; 008-146-338-695-878; 008-299-448-366-482; 008-311-034-167-562; 008-617-990-618-599; 009-456-643-711-23X; 009-473-064-291-132; 010-046-951-773-276; 010-529-000-464-722; 011-432-515-912-139; 013-045-638-660-608; 013-100-594-099-319; 014-027-440-367-649; 014-803-226-209-294; 014-975-584-055-994; 016-328-589-414-038; 017-114-011-996-265; 018-754-075-286-950; 019-350-155-846-095; 019-490-776-168-383; 019-535-383-706-319; 020-317-939-588-339; 020-512-833-958-294; 020-663-854-771-54X; 020-846-248-424-62X; 020-921-618-805-268; 021-371-921-725-474; 022-296-579-810-962; 023-754-878-402-83X; 024-943-753-334-49X; 025-868-348-105-086; 026-005-079-528-621; 026-438-345-858-193; 026-585-500-866-557; 026-760-282-205-990; 027-471-346-821-481; 027-596-452-583-463; 028-888-655-672-811; 028-949-168-216-348; 029-582-367-526-339; 029-866-270-253-340; 030-554-798-784-61X; 030-631-019-201-072; 030-970-307-671-139; 031-413-555-678-49X; 033-213-101-928-470; 033-934-927-039-151; 034-137-671-711-999; 035-926-525-104-056; 043-466-329-696-897; 043-581-829-340-751; 044-033-610-755-564; 044-048-018-849-205; 046-218-924-717-898; 046-228-291-907-921; 046-587-058-028-749; 046-590-316-486-070; 047-781-183-432-148; 047-930-087-747-314; 048-363-498-684-66X; 048-764-953-465-125; 054-262-694-329-790; 058-591-382-887-825; 059-644-665-214-332; 060-104-536-794-674; 061-204-281-009-906; 061-772-916-894-482; 061-848-813-662-863; 061-961-285-330-375; 063-250-438-205-105; 063-261-845-448-335; 063-926-482-822-28X; 064-139-124-121-591; 066-854-652-371-119; 069-500-271-025-432; 069-620-151-333-728; 069-683-787-506-768; 070-226-647-474-997; 071-188-013-298-92X; 071-904-188-966-680; 072-393-717-795-341; 077-316-978-661-205; 077-669-636-893-608; 082-255-695-900-573; 083-569-951-314-812; 087-306-273-037-262; 095-646-208-481-86X; 100-620-451-959-345; 100-831-059-726-280; 101-079-163-911-033; 101-866-778-767-755; 103-271-705-625-975; 103-411-069-157-833; 104-097-308-607-752; 109-101-533-725-641; 110-665-528-475-288; 113-404-906-083-171; 113-879-161-703-143; 122-678-214-643-62X; 128-216-915-841-145; 129-478-599-145-098; 135-654-207-256-336; 136-946-983-890-103; 144-522-905-985-255; 145-790-345-787-054; 155-911-627-663-755; 163-299-621-994-74X; 166-617-442-993-960; 167-747-237-523-259; 172-356-416-017-610,7

Previous studies, however, have emphasized; the variation of choice preferences as a function of the decision content (Kusev, van Schaik, Ayton, Dent & Chater, 2009). In one experiment we studied loss aversion for judgments of feelings with non-monetary and monetary unipolar and bipolar scales.

However, it is not thought to be necessary for more basic forms of social learning. Here we present evidence that in marmoset monkeys (Callithrix jacchus) even most basic forms of social learning such as enhancement depend on intention attribution. Marmosets perceived the behavior of a conspecific and a conspecific-like robot, but not that of a moving black box, as goal directed. Their subsequent choice behavior was shaped by social facilitation and stimulus enhancement, that is, by very simple forms of social learning, but only when exposed to the conspecific and robot, which they previously had perceived as intentional agents. We discuss the implications of this finding for contemporary debates about social learning, including emulation learning and ghost control studies, the necessity of goal-directed copying for cumulative cultural evolution, and the limits of current classification systems of social learning for the evolution of social and asocial learning.",126,2,129,138,Imitation; Social perception; Attribution; Emulation; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Sociocultural evolution; Copying; Social facilitation; Social psychology; Social learning,,"Animals; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Callithrix/psychology; Female; Imitative Behavior/physiology; Intention; Learning/physiology; Social Perception",,Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft; Forschungskredit der Universität Zürich; Bayerische Eliteförderung,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0026025 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22103235/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22103235 https://core.ac.uk/display/11284116 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/53599/ http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/53599/4/burkart_et_al_FINAL.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026025,22103235,10.1037/a0026025,2068572807,,0,000-036-548-641-001; 002-530-985-883-654; 008-264-329-879-445; 009-617-136-815-258; 018-859-349-680-068; 023-043-058-135-309; 026-120-508-609-651; 028-399-215-704-691; 037-767-936-701-813; 039-734-451-028-159; 039-962-849-097-570; 043-472-308-841-240; 046-484-081-683-635; 046-705-284-509-721; 053-616-201-313-838; 053-846-464-421-56X; 054-992-377-153-300; 057-426-865-870-694; 058-633-215-883-379; 062-155-997-405-099; 064-193-394-088-522; 065-068-331-255-34X; 068-724-185-917-123; 069-128-511-830-185; 074-579-067-892-26X; 077-158-183-357-495; 080-413-174-332-978; 086-289-480-773-504; 087-515-484-082-945; 088-161-517-507-817; 097-992-019-518-55X; 100-634-603-503-652; 103-854-178-667-181; 112-080-634-601-240; 116-464-539-978-662; 129-148-379-794-430; 139-445-473-939-134; 145-577-778-141-731; 154-133-371-540-844; 162-497-885-842-011; 163-479-403-050-247; 182-815-871-051-899,31

Erdman; Francesca Samsel; Daniel F. Keefe,"We present Bento Box, a virtual reality data visualization technique and bimanual 3D user interface for exploratory analysis of 4D data ensembles. Bento Box helps scientists and engineers make detailed comparative judgments about multiple time-varying data instances that make up a data ensemble (e.g., a group of 10 parameterized simulation runs). The approach is to present an organized set of complementary volume visualizations juxtaposed in a grid arrangement, where each column visualizes a single data instance and each row provides a new view of the volume from a different perspective and/or scale. A novel bimanual interface enables users to select a sub-volume of interest to create a new row on-the-fly, scrub through time, and quickly navigate through the resulting virtual ""bento box.'' The technique is evaluated through a real-world case study, supporting a team of medical device engineers and computational scientists using in-silico testing (supercomputer simulations) to redesign cardiac leads. The engineers confirmed hypotheses and developed new insights using a Bento Box visualization. An evaluation of the technical performance demonstrates that the proposed combination of data sampling strategies and clipped volume rendering is successful in displaying a juxtaposed visualization of fluid-structure-interaction simulation data (39 GB of raw data) at interactive VR frame rates.",6,,61,,Computer graphics (images); Raw data; Data visualization; Grid; Virtual reality; Volume rendering; Frame rate; Visualization; Computer science; Supercomputer,3D user interfaces; comparative visualization; ensemble visualization; small multiples; virtual reality,,,NIBIB NIH HHS (P41 EB002025) United States; NIBIB NIH HHS (R01 EB018205) United States,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/frobt.2019.00061/full https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/firai/firai6.html#JohnsonORMJESK19 https://figshare.com/collections/Bento_Box_An_Interactive_and_Zoomable_Small_Multiples_Technique_for_Visualizing_4D_Simulation_Ensembles_in_Virtual_Reality/4585352 https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC7805880,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/frobt.2019.00061,33501076,10.3389/frobt.2019.00061,2954490605,PMC7805880,0,005-737-821-537-576; 009-404-481-951-913; 011-070-627-374-43X; 011-466-555-434-712; 012-417-943-913-040; 014-391-134-171-040; 015-814-435-728-357; 017-324-710-183-920; 019-268-492-164-084; 023-264-911-447-617; 026-897-343-850-887; 030-002-406-097-605; 032-490-375-478-883; 033-902-322-292-959; 037-287-075-608-402; 041-823-987-962-392; 043-940-283-367-240; 044-782-743-179-714; 047-977-098-982-350; 051-999-118-590-533; 055-306-672-386-661; 056-021-265-141-496; 060-044-716-095-465; 060-594-454-420-884; 061-161-901-683-487; 063-060-293-275-729; 064-042-877-290-348; 068-139-821-084-47X; 068-333-247-420-086; 070-886-036-410-322; 077-348-708-946-709; 078-221-659-447-935; 083-371-559-994-67X; 087-690-960-188-686; 091-213-800-068-469; 092-213-021-972-447; 097-261-315-668-414; 101-338-071-554-335; 101-671-523-310-454; 112-005-770-885-911; 115-220-410-447-724; 133-998-235-910-40X; 135-500-282-635-561; 140-491-641-326-728; 160-273-659-598-860; 184-381-334-199-422; 184-606-987-477-092; 191-199-052-659-497; 191-409-292-323-573,4

To support critical applications (e.g., recommendation), in this paper, we shall focus on the collaborative ranking problems and construct a system of which the input is crowdsourced pairwise comparisons and the output is individual rankings. Under the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) parametric model assumption, we present a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) based on low-rank approach to estimate the underlying weight/score matrix, thereby predicting the individual ranking for each user. To address the unique challenge of the coupled non-convex low-rank constraint and the non-smooth elementwise infinity norm constraint in the resulting MLE problem, we propose a novel regularized formulation with the smoothed surrogate of elementwise infinity norm. By further exploiting the geometry of quotient manifolds of fixed-rank matrices, we solve the resulting smoothed rank-constrained optimization problem via developing the Riemannian trust-region algorithm which converges to an approximate local minimum from arbitrary initial points. Numerical results demonstrate the extraordinary effectiveness of the proposed method compared with the state-of-art algorithms.",,,949,956,Mathematical optimization; Statistical inference; Optimization problem; Uniform norm; Approximation algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Parametric model; Computer science; Data modeling,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icdm/icdm2017w.html#DongYS17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icdmw.2017.130,,10.1109/icdmw.2017.130,2771116583,,0,001-571-051-609-613; 001-631-224-533-795; 002-626-419-212-422; 010-132-302-334-522; 011-005-333-901-758; 012-596-707-828-262; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-192-429-211-578; 024-603-473-851-707; 027-265-693-295-060; 028-425-889-836-865; 037-227-920-279-737; 046-922-264-068-616; 051-597-751-617-947; 053-020-169-364-397; 054-165-888-981-221; 055-793-187-478-627; 057-546-501-967-993; 068-101-414-213-728; 073-224-836-193-123; 074-233-078-181-385; 075-642-031-621-121; 087-991-691-200-809; 115-403-493-349-434; 122-015-869-775-191; 128-293-092-152-988; 144-607-646-779-766; 147-220-478-675-708; 148-128-226-546-082; 162-958-570-361-554; 163-923-706-198-968; 164-839-827-201-152; 170-911-634-334-179; 173-373-811-316-902; 186-557-847-040-512; 194-279-351-420-987; 195-496-989-008-323; 195-685-864-553-865,1

Marley,"Abstract We show how to combine statistically efficient ways to design discrete choice experiments based on random utility theory with new ways of collecting additional information that can be used to expand the amount of available choice information for modeling the choices of individual decision makers. Here we limit ourselves to problems involving generic choice options and linear and additive indirect utility functions, but the approach potentially can be extended to include choice problems with non-additive utility functions and non-generic/labeled options/attributes. The paper provides several simulated examples, a small empirical example to demonstrate proof of concept, and a larger empirical example based on many experimental conditions and large samples that demonstrates that the individual models capture virtually all the variance in aggregate first choices traditionally modeled in discrete choice experiments.",1,1,128,164,Proof of concept; Mathematical economics; Econometrics; Economics; Choice set; Econometric model; Discrete choice; Discrete choice experiment; Random utility theory,,,,,https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/bitstream/10453/9977/1/2008000026.pdf https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/66823 https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/9977 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700253 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700253 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-9af58d0f-da0c-329a-bee6-d1336cc6d2d0 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82131918.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70025-3,,10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70025-3,1985136372,,0,000-749-390-969-022; 001-362-199-882-05X; 003-939-760-735-714; 004-955-765-542-299; 005-747-762-166-742; 005-844-689-987-193; 006-683-511-983-752; 009-301-886-916-743; 009-339-854-751-554; 010-678-441-963-454; 011-758-819-825-173; 012-673-516-549-451; 012-743-153-762-931; 024-683-165-045-722; 026-205-132-090-62X; 026-298-384-101-255; 028-507-914-170-559; 034-700-010-278-737; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-030-452-133-946; 044-270-853-465-587; 046-010-248-009-876; 047-077-704-250-798; 056-335-281-206-685; 057-612-005-514-613; 059-899-367-297-496; 063-123-327-601-576; 065-409-107-548-650; 067-704-491-879-845; 079-804-361-896-421; 082-755-371-884-846; 085-138-376-626-614; 085-576-748-747-709; 095-033-878-232-844; 100-440-892-234-712; 105-171-607-179-849; 107-781-135-837-372; 110-918-754-580-61X; 111-459-997-118-741; 113-059-561-380-183; 114-685-371-109-418; 118-026-686-914-338; 119-000-371-950-394; 120-777-492-864-220; 131-743-743-266-190; 135-459-829-666-918; 136-407-937-017-028; 137-568-032-078-508; 139-706-646-125-941; 142-059-720-766-158; 144-344-557-478-935; 149-689-713-843-54X; 151-883-772-833-131; 157-428-181-292-496; 164-260-106-908-120; 165-194-337-288-970; 172-864-016-775-966; 179-564-776-115-100; 193-799-509-777-293,173

Qualitative and quantitative data collected at the time provided triangulation of cohort preferences and insight into the reasoning of the participants. The results indicate that a high friction surface on AT cutlery handles is useful for all upper limb impaired users; however, the unconventional shapes of the Caring Cutlery better match the grip patterns generated by those with arthritis.

Results from a discrete choice experiment in screening for colorectal cancer.,2008-07-24,2008,journal article,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,15244733; 10983015,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Kirsten Howard; Glenn Salkeld,"Abstract Objective Recent reviews of discrete choice methodology identified methodological issues warranting further exploration, including the issue of ""framing."" The objective of this study was to conduct a methodological exploration of the effect of attribute framing on marginal rates of substitution (MRS), including willingness to pay (WTP) from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), within the context of colorectal cancer screening preferences. Methods The survey, a fractional factorial design of a two-alternative, unlabeled experiment, was mailed to a sample of 1920 subjects in NSW, Australia. Participants were randomized to one of four alternative ""frames"" of information. Attributes included: accuracy of the test for finding cancers, accuracy of the test for finding large polyps, how good the test is at saying you don't have cancer, cost, dietary and medication restrictions and sample collection. A mixed logit model was used to estimate preferences; MRS between attributes, including WTP, was calculated. Results A total of 1157 surveys from 1920 (60.2%) were returned. Accuracy of the test for finding cancer was most likely to influence choice of test, followed by accuracy of the test for finding large polyps. Under some circumstances, framing of the attributes (e.g., cancers found vs. cancers missed) influenced the relative importance of attributes. Attribute framing significantly influenced estimates of WTP, and benefit: harm trade-offs that were calculated from MRS. Conclusions Attribute framing can influence willingness to pay and benefit: harm trade-offs from DCEs. Appropriate design and analysis methods should be explored to further characterize the influence and extent of framing in discrete choice studies.",12,2,354,363,Data collection; Econometrics; Economics; Framing (social sciences); Discrete choice; Willingness to pay; Sample collection; Multivariate analysis; Confidence interval; Mixed logit,,"Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choice Behavior; Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis; Confidence Intervals; Data Collection; Female; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; Mass Screening/adverse effects; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Multivariate Analysis; New South Wales; Occult Blood; Patient Satisfaction/economics; Pilot Projects; Risk Assessment; Sensitivity and Specificity",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18657102/ https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00417.x https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301510607152 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301510607152 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18657102 https://core.ac.uk/display/82318228 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00417.x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82318228.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00417.x,18657102,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2008.00417.x,1976417499,,0,000-749-390-969-022; 001-623-627-935-385; 005-617-903-937-913; 005-819-469-291-018; 008-123-690-924-463; 008-673-113-732-433; 008-773-873-552-417; 009-339-854-751-554; 012-227-465-715-260; 012-743-153-762-931; 013-813-841-393-276; 014-458-295-683-489; 014-607-945-346-879; 018-257-363-888-078; 018-509-453-026-429; 019-152-847-843-744; 020-343-340-469-199; 024-712-598-729-230; 025-271-819-261-797; 030-843-276-160-798; 030-851-370-133-307; 031-837-508-588-570; 031-939-240-759-769; 034-087-549-813-040; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-663-805-242-561; 040-921-258-186-269; 041-659-281-349-623; 048-666-204-725-664; 048-900-778-768-199; 051-102-339-668-702; 055-696-712-675-377; 057-612-005-514-613; 057-657-809-679-383; 061-871-987-984-921; 063-454-129-329-408; 063-558-774-549-127; 065-409-107-548-650; 069-320-152-359-474; 071-674-642-056-169; 072-231-542-835-88X; 076-019-103-850-620; 077-145-255-358-874; 080-446-700-500-494; 085-138-376-626-614; 093-472-739-539-696; 095-033-878-232-844; 095-111-682-990-433; 095-720-759-868-465; 096-204-658-691-950; 098-157-825-033-765; 098-174-964-658-380; 098-376-587-660-420; 105-669-928-086-705; 106-209-154-927-046; 107-031-853-409-505; 114-258-605-734-050; 116-411-055-251-767; 122-127-936-570-150; 128-315-979-589-27X; 137-124-248-936-05X; 140-387-261-581-516; 140-617-185-923-211; 155-204-375-298-516; 160-441-821-953-411,89
019-997-385-486-803,Predicted action consequences are perceptually facilitated before cancellation.,2017-03-06,2017,journal article,Journal of experimental psychology. Human perception and performance,19391277; 00961523,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Daniel Yon; Clare Press,"Models of action control suggest that predicted action outcomes are ""cancelled"" from perception, allowing agents to devote resources to more behaviorally relevant unexpected events. These models are supported by a range of findings demonstrating that expected consequences of action are perceived less intensely than unexpected events. A key assumption of these models is that the prediction is subtracted from the sensory input. This early subtraction allows preferential processing of unexpected events from the outset of movement, thereby promoting rapid initiation of corrective actions and updating of predictive models. We tested this assumption in three psychophysical experiments. Participants rated the intensity (brightness) of observed finger movements congruent or incongruent with their own movements at different timepoints after action. Across Experiments 1 and 2, evidence of cancellation-whereby congruent events appeared less bright than incongruent events-was only found 200 ms after action, whereas an opposite effect of brighter congruent percepts was observed in earlier time ranges (50 ms after action). Experiment 3 demonstrated that this interaction was not a result of response bias. These findings suggest that ""cancellation"" may not be the rapid process assumed in the literature, and that perception of predicted action outcomes is initially ""facilitated."" We speculate that the representation of our environment may in fact be optimized via two opposing processes: The primary process facilitates perception of events consistent with predictions and thereby helps us to perceive what is more likely, but a later process aids the perception of any detected events generating prediction errors to assist model updating.

Tam; C. M. Tam; Tak Wing Yiu; Sai On Cheung,"With the rise in the public concern on environmental protection, more construction firms start to apply environmental management for their construction activities. As a result, environmental management systems (EMS) have been implemented in construction. However, to improve the construction environment in Hong Kong, environmental performance assessment (EPA) has been designed for reviewing, monitoring, checking and evaluating environmental performance. A list of evaluation factors for EPA are identified and grouped into seven major factors: management and training; air and noise; auditing; waste and water; cost saving on resources; energy; and regulation. The results from a survey highlight that the most important evaluation factor is management and training and the least significant result is regulation. A voluntary approach has been promoted instead of the traditional mandatory system.

We investigated the personal understanding of ‘Sustainable Development’ of scholars involved in teacher training programs and in the academic field of Education for Sustainable Development. To this purpose, an on-line survey was conducted based on the principle of comparative judgement. After careful selection, 249 academics were found to fit the specific profile for inclusion into the study. All of them were invited and56 of them participated. The instrument consisted of 16 statements built specifically to reflect different interpretations of sustainable development: fragmented, separated, holistic and integrated perspectives. Each participant compared 12 pairs of statements and were asked to decide which one better represented their interpretation of the concept of Sustainable Development in the context of Education for Sustainable Development. Using the D-PAC methodology for comparative judgement, our results show that the statements that were most often chosen prioritized an understanding of Sustainable Development according to which two or three of the dimensions of the concept (environment, society, economy) are seen as separated to each other and less often in an integrated way. The scale reliability was equal to 0.79, indicating good quality of the measurement. The results show that academics in the field of Education for Sustainable Development do not conceive of the concept of Sustainable Development holistically. There is also a tendency towards social and economic aspects of Sustainable Development.

Human perception and performance,19391277; 00961523,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,William J. Matthews; Neil Stewart; John H. Wearden,"This article explores the widely reported finding that the subjective duration of a stimulus is positively related to its magnitude. In Experiments 1 and 2 we show that, for both auditory and visual stimuli, the effect of stimulus magnitude on the perception of duration depends upon the background: Against a high intensity background, weak stimuli are judged to last longer. In Experiment 3 we show that the effect of intensity becomes more pronounced at longer durations, consistent with the idea that stimulus intensity affects the pacemaker component of an internal clock, and that it is the difference of a stimulus from the background, rather than its absolute magnitude, which influences the rate of the pacemaker. These results urge a modification to the oft-repeated claim that more intense stimuli seem to last longer, and provide an important constraint on any model of human timing.",37,1,303,313,Second-order stimulus; Developmental psychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Time perception; Visual perception; Perception; Neutral stimulus; Audiology; Stimulus control,,"Acoustic Stimulation; Auditory Perception; Humans; Judgment; Models, Psychological; Photic Stimulation; Time Perception; Visual Perception",,Economic and Social Research Council,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0019961 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2010-17385-001 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20731508 https://core.ac.uk/display/9064905 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/36030/ http://repository.essex.ac.uk/1584/ http://repository.essex.ac.uk/1584/1/JEP-HPP%202009-1538R.pdf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ933747,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0019961,20731508,10.1037/a0019961,2171702576,,0,000-841-668-422-729; 001-156-714-394-37X; 001-187-724-833-227; 001-444-401-468-83X; 003-055-719-435-353; 003-082-950-776-533; 005-881-575-136-027; 007-996-363-197-55X; 008-331-913-073-376; 013-894-593-955-344; 015-555-447-330-617; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-955-306-539-594; 019-313-788-423-049; 024-084-763-466-370; 024-403-671-372-719; 024-943-753-334-49X; 025-053-282-361-812; 026-522-501-396-608; 027-929-276-107-144; 029-915-293-337-721; 035-143-942-540-296; 036-001-714-608-271; 036-834-998-742-750; 040-274-506-946-354; 047-242-580-763-167; 049-773-323-519-855; 050-520-388-037-080; 051-693-091-004-036; 055-186-259-614-508; 056-677-495-210-137; 059-302-063-243-515; 059-680-304-687-108; 060-645-774-719-735; 061-517-830-110-36X; 061-906-250-506-527; 063-443-201-462-614; 064-858-030-569-046; 065-513-607-899-801; 073-823-911-313-872; 080-285-334-414-320; 080-672-396-104-037; 081-907-787-668-358; 082-603-289-734-424; 085-174-737-891-965; 086-116-176-108-539; 094-707-743-809-695; 096-167-391-482-040; 097-649-832-039-369; 099-225-267-178-924; 101-681-995-231-34X; 102-755-968-592-356; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-794-720-847-703; 107-022-923-209-783; 107-062-110-510-516; 111-256-616-453-598; 111-807-149-235-791; 123-038-771-729-451; 127-930-296-287-932; 128-343-224-895-971; 129-983-746-595-521; 130-311-347-164-699; 131-727-876-312-007; 132-147-384-499-050; 145-102-759-809-08X; 153-760-886-524-145; 155-404-255-357-768; 182-155-455-647-06X,74

On the other hand, researchers of object cognition have suggested another hypothesis for brain activity in IPS during the processing of number, namely that this activity simply correlates with the number of visual objects or units that are perceived. We contrasted these two accounts by analyzing multivoxel activity patterns elicited by dot patterns and Arabic digits of different magnitudes while participants were explicitly processing the represented numerical magnitude. The activity pattern elicited by the digit ""8"" was more similar to the activity pattern elicited by one dot with which the digit shares the number of visual units but not the magnitude compared to the activity pattern elicited by eight dots, with which the digit shares the represented abstract numerical magnitude. A multivoxel pattern classifier trained to differentiate one dot from eight dots classified all Arabic digits in the one-dot pattern category, irrespective of the numerical magnitude symbolized by the digit. These results were consistently obtained for different digits in IPS, its subregions, and many other brain regions. As predicted from object cognition theories, the number of presented visual units forms the link between the parietal activation elicited by symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers. The current study is difficult to reconcile with the hypothesis that parietal activation elicited by numbers would reflect a format-independent representation of number.",27,7,1376,1387,Brain activity and meditation; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Pattern recognition; Working memory; Parietal lobe; Intraparietal sulcus; Numerical cognition; Communication; Posterior parietal cortex; Arabic numerals,,"Adult; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Models, Neurological; Neuropsychological Tests; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted",,,https://doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00787 http://cognet.mit.edu/journal/10.1162/jocn_a_00787 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jocn/jocn27.html#BultheSB15 https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/10.1162/jocn_a_00787 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/109153 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25633646 https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/jocn_a_00787 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34618764.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1162/jocn_a_00787,25633646,10.1162/jocn_a_00787,2094406680,,0,002-489-301-712-327; 003-710-302-053-681; 004-079-468-869-677; 004-383-544-937-069; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-619-866-773-125; 008-660-756-899-541; 010-629-061-233-301; 019-198-395-259-670; 020-406-773-486-213; 026-617-630-691-234; 032-188-208-040-57X; 033-039-347-567-168; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-116-487-736-102; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-559-042-610-406; 043-321-139-129-966; 045-304-341-837-630; 049-007-929-029-76X; 049-604-801-970-089; 051-065-078-444-590; 058-551-875-148-039; 058-978-410-071-695; 059-305-264-094-150; 059-578-321-252-615; 059-737-872-709-592; 061-503-605-759-480; 062-468-689-286-611; 066-451-801-924-025; 066-946-988-025-939; 067-219-820-953-219; 067-583-756-505-85X; 067-703-720-150-093; 069-548-364-501-728; 070-996-780-565-493; 071-011-326-519-531; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-559-509-594-186; 075-614-249-918-392; 079-581-413-725-187; 082-391-920-356-292; 084-699-176-175-453; 092-307-014-407-121; 092-491-995-641-38X; 092-960-334-718-350; 099-794-213-253-183; 104-898-249-163-45X; 116-385-741-165-205; 123-238-467-675-125; 149-682-914-539-243,41

Moore,"Recent research has shown that when people compare one thing to another, they tend to focus myopically on the target of the comparative judgment and do not sufficiently consider the referent to which the target is being compared. This paper applies this recent theoretical progress to the problem of predicting the outcomes of athletic competitions. In three studies, we show that the focal competitor’s strengths and weaknesses feature more prominently than do the strengths and weaknesses of the opponents. People are more confident of success when their own side is strong, regardless of how strong the competition is.

Nowak,"The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints in the form of distance comparisons like ""item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$"". Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. To account for errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct constraint with some probability. This paper makes several new contributions to this problem. First, we derive prediction error bounds for ordinal embedding with noise by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in $\mathbb{R}^d$ is at most $d+2$. These bounds characterize how well a learned embedding predicts new comparative judgments. Second, we investigate the special case of a known noise model and study the Maximum Likelihood estimator. Third, knowledge of the noise model enables us to relate prediction errors to embedding accuracy. This relationship is highly non-trivial since we show that the linear map corresponding to distance comparisons is non-invertible, but there exists a nonlinear map that is invertible. Fourth, two new algorithms for ordinal embedding are proposed and evaluated in experiments.",,,,,Special case; Distance matrix; Discrete mathematics; Existential quantification; Euclidean space; Mathematics; Embedding; Linear map; Ordinal number; Invertible matrix,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07081v1 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07081 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07081 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1606.07081,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.07081v1,,,2474122884,,0,013-282-966-058-009; 016-164-736-728-056; 076-045-489-927-422; 105-209-607-529-360; 116-389-127-793-162; 127-823-888-551-617; 131-722-355-443-738; 132-655-282-879-547; 139-311-814-504-419; 154-554-618-227-223; 158-687-817-281-331; 163-466-257-220-611,15

Aspiras; Erin A. Vogel; Heather M. Haught; Lindsay Roberts,"Comparative judgment biases—wherein a majority of people report being above- or below-average in their abilities, traits, or future events—are a robust phenomenon in psychology. A recent explanation for these biases has focused on people's awareness that many comparative judgment domains form skewed distributions, and, hence, a majority of people can feasibly be above or below average. Indeed, this prior research found that comparative biases for abilities emerged more for skewed (vs. normal) distributions. In the current research, we attempted to (i) conceptually replicate this finding in a comparative likelihood context and (ii) provide evidence of an alternative explanation for the prior results. Replicating prior research, three correlational studies and one experimental study found that event skewness was related to direct comparative likelihood judgments for health events, such that comparative optimism emerged more for events judged or manipulated to come from positively skewed distributions than from negatively skewed distributions. However, event skewness was unrelated to indirect comparisons (absolute self minus absolute other). Moreover, consistent with an egocentric-processes account, absolute self-judgments were more predictive of direct comparisons than were absolute other judgments and showed the same association with event skewness as direct comparisons. Implications for explaining and interpreting comparative judgment biases are discussed.

A proposed measure of the ANS, the so-called 'internal Weber fraction' (w), would provide a clear measure of ANS acuity. However, ANS studies have never presented adequate evidence that the visual stimulus parameters did not compromise measurements of w to such extent that w is actually driven by visual instead of numerical processes. We therefore investigated this question by testing non-symbolic magnitude discrimination in seven-year-old children and adults. We controlled for visual parameters in a more stringent manner than usual. As a consequence of these controls, in some trials numerical cues correlated positively with number while in others they correlated negatively with number. This congruency effect strongly correlated with w, which means that congruency effects were probably driving effects in w. Consequently, in both adults and children congruency had a major impact on the fit of the model underlying the computation of w. Furthermore, children showed larger congruency effects than adults. This suggests that ANS tasks are seriously compromised by the visual stimulus parameters, which cannot be controlled. Hence, they are not pure measures of the ANS and some putative w or ratio effect differences between children and adults in previous ANS studies may be due to the differential influence of the visual stimulus parameters in children and adults. In addition, because the resolution of congruency effects relies on inhibitory (interference suppression) function, some previous ANS findings were probably influenced by the developmental state of inhibitory processes especially when comparing children with developmental dyscalculia and typically developing children.",4,,444,444,Developmental psychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Number sense; Approximate number system; Dyscalculia; Developmental Dyscalculia; Weber fraction; Typically developing; Numerical cognition; Audiology,ANS; Weber fraction; dyscalculia; magnitude comparison; mathematical development; number sense; numerical cognition,,,Medical Research Council (G0001354) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0900643) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3715731/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3715731 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00444/full http://core.ac.uk/display/26026090 https://researchnow.flinders.edu.au/en/publications/visual-stimulus-parameters-seriously-compromise-the-measurement-o https://philpapers.org/rec/SZCVSP http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00444/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82866348.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00444,23882245,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00444,2000286727,PMC3715731,0,000-691-834-305-616; 002-743-317-587-306; 004-030-636-268-081; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-548-790-016-05X; 010-855-047-487-984; 021-766-245-409-113; 026-801-611-514-937; 026-904-446-310-931; 028-193-386-916-716; 036-252-751-004-174; 036-302-964-021-739; 038-836-693-377-803; 039-555-369-773-746; 041-617-410-870-824; 044-978-090-842-05X; 045-735-184-813-268; 047-440-067-968-409; 049-987-119-734-009; 050-114-019-199-339; 051-363-523-188-499; 052-802-118-127-48X; 053-175-188-303-668; 061-272-159-716-134; 062-214-173-891-992; 062-906-094-628-798; 064-385-111-633-946; 064-535-670-863-140; 065-366-926-645-561; 069-521-385-478-387; 072-498-336-478-394; 078-699-018-002-285; 086-922-926-484-143; 087-709-692-997-280; 097-933-480-117-519; 099-136-579-277-759; 120-677-434-783-598; 138-505-083-445-265; 179-495-082-234-598,112

In Experiment 1 we used 1/f filtered grayscale images as well as their thresholded (black and white) and edges only counterparts. Separate groups of observers viewed different types of images varying in slope of their amplitude spectra. Although with each image type, the groups exhibited the “universal” pattern of preference for intermediate amplitude spectrum slopes, we identified 4 distinct sub-groups in each case. Sub-group 1 exhibited a typical peak preference for intermediate amplitude spectrum slopes (‘intermediate’; approx. 50%); sub-group 2 exhibited a linear increase in preference with increasing amplitude spectrum slope (“smooth”; approx. 20%), while sub-group 3 exhibited a linear decrease in preference as a function of the amplitude spectrum slope (“sharp”; approx. 20%). Sub-group 4 revealed no significant preference (“other”; approx. 10%). In Experiment 2, we extended the range of different image types and investigated preferences within the same observers. We replicate the results of our first experiment and show that individual participants exhibit stable patterns of preference across a wide range of image types. In both experiments, Q-mode factor analysis identified two principal factors that were able to explain more than 80% of inter individual variations in preference across all types of images, suggesting a highly similar dimensional structure of inter individual variations in preference for fractal-like scaling characteristics.",10,,350,350,Statistics; Frequency spectrum; Amplitude; Approx; Replicate; Fractal pattern; Mathematics; Fractal; Social psychology; Grayscale; Scaling,aesthetics; fractals; individual differences; individual variability; visual preference,,,Australian Research Council,http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27458365 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4937063 https://core.ac.uk/display/82854035 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82854035.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350,27458365,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350,2469402787,PMC4937063,0,000-128-261-521-190; 001-211-147-613-925; 002-661-886-502-828; 003-824-045-896-463; 003-959-456-375-10X; 005-077-663-744-498; 007-680-062-502-548; 010-034-760-108-136; 011-215-627-956-928; 013-901-094-038-405; 016-807-326-825-159; 021-833-060-736-756; 024-487-050-604-231; 026-522-767-947-577; 026-697-184-672-246; 028-909-435-621-641; 029-291-085-676-195; 030-106-413-511-735; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-749-371-633-87X; 038-806-201-427-687; 042-329-006-864-369; 043-311-834-368-521; 043-968-325-175-314; 044-398-804-481-25X; 045-877-232-534-487; 046-893-819-712-314; 059-859-454-431-546; 063-259-257-507-199; 065-239-547-848-682; 070-288-762-588-459; 071-894-179-083-409; 072-603-939-753-887; 078-003-375-336-760; 083-056-154-487-047; 089-270-300-626-793; 094-159-592-916-885; 095-881-581-669-414; 097-582-727-442-590; 110-969-517-377-159; 123-113-541-328-801; 134-805-430-204-693; 141-816-682-274-53X; 145-132-276-594-878,35

These discriminations, however, need not entail numerical representation of the quantities being compared. This research evaluated the role of both non-numerical and numerical information in adult judgments of relative numerosity for large-numerosity spatial arrays. Results of Experiment 1 indicated that judgments of relative numerosity were affected by the amount of open space in the arrays being compared. Further, the accuracy of verbal estimates of the numerosities of the arrays made upon completion of the comparison task bore little relation to performance on that task. Experiment 2, however, showed that numerical estimates for individually presented arrays were affected in much the same way by open space within or around the edges of the array as were the comparative judgments examined in Experiment 1. The findings suggest that adults heuristically utilize non-numerical cues as well as numerical information in apprehending large numerosities.",107,2,460,478,Psychophysics; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Discrimination learning; Field Dependence-Independence; Size Perception; Numerical cognition; Social psychology,,"Adolescent; Adult; Attention; Discrimination Learning; Female; Field Dependence-Independence; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematics; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Problem Solving; Psychophysics; Size Perception; Space Perception",,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18082157/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027707002685 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ790503 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027707002685#! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18082157,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2007.10.009,18082157,10.1016/j.cognition.2007.10.009,1994063640,,0,000-691-834-305-616; 022-049-380-598-783; 024-892-179-985-572; 027-423-831-311-307; 029-224-054-472-894; 032-162-703-324-873; 032-898-702-108-37X; 037-080-984-994-496; 037-454-482-238-600; 038-983-486-567-663; 039-866-525-488-655; 049-603-036-032-209; 055-946-027-823-561; 056-362-878-092-354; 057-063-389-833-015; 057-349-983-849-38X; 058-213-217-734-122; 058-484-878-223-236; 062-906-094-628-798; 069-521-385-478-387; 071-359-050-983-153; 092-568-831-144-646; 096-169-707-585-45X; 096-507-969-290-685; 100-553-245-325-678; 104-771-096-316-022; 119-992-041-932-235; 120-204-913-104-353; 129-827-356-327-594; 139-446-526-338-725; 141-573-208-820-528; 154-088-334-261-934; 165-194-450-269-480; 193-482-593-038-438,44

Two groups of musicians were recruited: improvising ( n =12) and score-dependent (non-improvising) musicians ( n =12). While listening to both familiar and unfamiliar music, subjects either (covertly) appraised the presented music performance or imagined they were playing the music themselves. We hypothesized that improvising musicians would exhibit enhanced efficiency of audiomotor transformation reflected by stronger ventral premotor activation. Statistical Parametric Mapping revealed that, while virtually ‘playing along׳ with the music, improvising musicians exhibited activation of a right-hemisphere distribution of cerebral areas including posterior-superior parietal and dorsal premotor cortex. Involvement of these right-hemisphere dorsal stream areas suggests that improvising musicians recruited an amodal spatial processing system subserving pitch-to-space transformations to facilitate their virtual motor performance. Score-dependent musicians recruited a primarily left-hemisphere pattern of motor areas together with the posterior part of the right superior temporal sulcus, suggesting a relationship between aural discrimination and symbolic representation. Activations in bilateral auditory cortex were significantly larger for improvising musicians than for score-dependent musicians, suggesting enhanced top-down effects on aural perception. Our results suggest that learning to play a music instrument primarily from notation predisposes musicians toward aural identification and discrimination, while learning by improvisation involves audio-spatial-motor transformations, not only during performance, but also perception.",1624,1624,253,264,Psychology; Amodal perception; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Intraparietal sulcus; Motor cortex; Premotor cortex; Auditory cortex; Posterior parietal cortex; Mental rotation,Audiomotor transformation; Aural perception; Music improvisation; Parietal cortex; Premotor cortex; Score-dependency,"Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Aged; Auditory Perception/physiology; Brain Mapping; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mental Processes; Middle Aged; Music; Nerve Net/blood supply; Oxygen/blood; Parietal Lobe/blood supply; Professional Competence; Reaction Time; Temporal Lobe/blood supply; Young Adult",Oxygen,Gratama Foundation; Prince Claus Conservatoire; the Research Group Lifelong Learning in Music,https://core.ac.uk/display/158783143 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899315005442 https://research.hanze.nl/ws/files/12456685/07.BRAIN_RESEARCH_ADVANCED_PUBLICATION.pdf https://research.hanze.nl/en/publications/differential-parietal-and-temporal-contributions-to-music-percept https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2Facffb03e-6a7c-405a-ab77-3e8ebd27b068 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26206300 https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/differential-parietal-and-temporal-contributions-to-music-perception-in-improvising-and-scoredependent-musicians-an-fmri-study(acffb03e-6a7c-405a-ab77-3e8ebd27b068).html https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/files/112510943/Differential_parietal_and_temporal_contributions_to_music_perception_in_improvising.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0006899315005442 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82115494.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.brainres.2015.06.050,26206300,10.1016/j.brainres.2015.06.050,967246312,,0,000-869-141-291-341; 002-060-764-851-92X; 002-088-499-849-347; 002-389-673-919-996; 002-537-195-213-818; 002-755-309-084-889; 003-435-667-047-061; 003-557-841-970-958; 005-359-240-366-590; 006-146-448-232-249; 006-520-277-297-60X; 006-534-080-097-548; 007-212-833-000-654; 008-354-447-753-834; 010-433-049-189-542; 014-092-127-702-261; 014-117-347-204-270; 015-729-075-909-616; 015-882-949-708-585; 015-932-556-337-341; 016-157-096-736-924; 018-856-769-689-719; 020-486-427-425-20X; 020-956-153-478-833; 021-868-798-081-047; 022-390-760-970-283; 023-575-604-815-844; 024-560-765-927-69X; 025-938-843-163-700; 027-285-997-251-014; 027-306-850-437-711; 027-925-509-118-429; 028-021-687-677-439; 028-700-216-212-234; 029-306-235-834-806; 029-849-316-895-070; 032-594-369-600-05X; 033-255-090-391-537; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-042-666-684-45X; 036-760-125-168-818; 037-359-293-693-799; 037-644-679-368-748; 038-172-122-770-258; 038-210-281-157-666; 039-767-710-934-000; 042-587-179-614-888; 042-644-475-069-683; 042-878-219-864-743; 044-242-402-144-102; 045-024-743-785-152; 048-854-871-614-528; 049-037-512-909-291; 049-362-409-469-354; 049-725-492-962-923; 053-049-428-487-703; 054-203-268-848-176; 054-320-607-012-641; 057-198-980-484-180; 058-151-742-757-612; 058-268-711-129-508; 058-299-660-927-770; 060-986-952-888-925; 061-008-544-092-150; 063-372-785-764-716; 064-017-385-319-330; 066-367-390-269-027; 066-451-801-924-025; 071-962-576-676-234; 072-157-343-216-127; 074-050-973-754-678; 076-282-139-499-586; 078-094-899-365-083; 078-320-139-543-249; 079-696-852-729-083; 080-669-652-469-346; 086-734-565-781-24X; 087-254-716-496-31X; 087-741-361-491-162; 090-476-434-542-957; 093-642-009-697-149; 097-880-126-350-434; 097-910-556-511-589; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-070-612-434-473; 106-654-402-991-537; 107-471-944-037-048; 108-966-603-076-920; 112-172-823-029-632; 112-753-021-914-395; 114-711-956-307-475; 117-754-012-070-57X; 120-891-934-941-617; 120-993-847-279-490; 128-262-496-102-379; 128-606-758-459-05X; 130-148-597-698-397; 131-040-957-155-671; 135-147-231-070-527; 151-178-516-367-000; 157-087-475-157-377; 157-539-961-901-16X,13

Methods: In this article, a consensus model for group decision-making (GDM), based on the analytic hierarchy process (AHP), is developed to gather group ideas and analyze the real estate investment environment under multi-criteria problems. Twelve evaluation procedures of the developed model, which increase the convergence of the opinions of multiple experts, are proposed.

Indeed, fingers have been assumed to contribute to: (1) giving an iconic representation of numbers (Fayol and Seron, 2005); (2) keeping track of the number words uttered while reciting the counting sequence (Fuson et al., 1982); (3) sustaining the induction of the one-to-one correspondence principle (Alibali and DiRusso, 1999) by helping children to coordinate the processes of tagging (i.e., attribution of a counting word to each item) and partitioning (i.e., isolating the items already counted from those which remained to be counted; Gelman and Gallistel, 1978); (4) sustaining the assimilation of the stable-order principle (i.e., numerical labels have to be enumerated in the same order across counting sequences) by supporting the emergence of a routine to link fingers to objects in a sequential, culture-specific stable order (Wiese, 2003a,b); (5) sustaining the comprehension of the cardinality principle (i.e., the last number word uttered while counting determines the total number of objects in a set) by leading children to always reach the same finger when counting to a specific number (Fayol and Seron, 2005); (6) prompting the understanding of the 10-base numerical system (as on our hands we represent numbers as a sum and/or a multiple of 10); and (7) sustaining the realization of basic arithmetic operations (Baroody, 1987; Fuson and Kwon, 1992; Geary, 1994; Ifrah, 2000).",2,242,242,242,Finger-counting; Numerical system; Functional role; Cardinality; Computer science; Numerical cognition; Comprehension; Assimilation (phonology); Arithmetic,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/27008440 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3180171 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:200038 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00242/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21980315 https://doaj.org/article/2cb9aff29b374eb288ebcb30f95bf5f3 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00242/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00242/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82876131.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00242,21980315,10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00242,2120319243,PMC3180171,0,005-451-984-853-625; 008-373-567-331-285; 014-964-464-165-159; 015-364-587-824-983; 029-018-861-638-152; 033-133-100-183-980; 033-843-519-722-206; 039-180-277-011-72X; 053-724-999-609-942; 062-391-912-092-041; 069-952-634-268-159; 079-954-277-766-29X; 084-183-231-327-628; 094-472-031-742-070; 104-898-249-163-45X; 105-763-378-001-05X; 164-046-578-199-011; 197-871-165-836-067,34

This paper applies a novel approach to facilitating novice feedback: making use of students’ inherent ability to compare. The ComPAIR application discussed in this article scaffolds peer feedback through comparisons, asking students to choose the “better” of two answers in a series of pairings offered in an engaging online context. In contrast to other peer-feedback approaches that seek to train novices to be able to provide expert feedback (such as calibrated peer review) or to crowdsource grading, ComPAIR focuses upon the benefits to be gained from the critical process of comparison and ranking. The tool design is based on the longstanding psychological principle of comparative judgement, by which novices who may not yet have the compass to assess others’ work confidently can still rank content as “better” with accuracy. Data from 168 students in pilot studies in English, Physics and Math courses at the University of British Columbia are reviewed. Though the use of ComPAIR required little classroom time, students perceived this approach to increase their facility with course content, their ability assess their own work, and their capacity to provide feedback on the work of others in a collaborative learning environment.",5,2,89,113,Collaborative learning; Grading (education); Mathematics education; Body of knowledge; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Computer science; Peer feedback; Cooperative learning; Knowledge management; Teaching method,,,,,https://jmss.org/index.php/TLI/article/view/57484 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1156350.pdf http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1156350.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/87752274 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1156350 http://tlijournal.com/tli/index.php/TLI/article/view/156,http://dx.doi.org/10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.2.8,,10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.2.8,2756771427,,0,007-480-370-853-992; 007-702-163-095-94X; 019-556-884-590-37X; 042-436-932-221-374; 075-245-815-139-991; 080-170-730-910-326,8

Studies have proven that presence of shelters decreases aggressive behaviour of Scylla spp. in ponds and tanks. In this study, the shelter colour preference was determined in the wild captured purple mud crab Scylla tranquebarica (Fabricius) in an outdoor round black tank. Eight out of 48 PVC pipes were painted either blue, green, red, black or white. Other eight were not painted and were provided as grey shelters. The shelters were presented in different two-colour pairs to a group of 35 crabs; eight shelters of one colour and eight of other colour were arranged alternately on the tank bottom, and the number of occupants was recorded. After emptying the shelters, the shelters rearranged for the next observation. Each colour combination was repeated five times, and total of 15 combinations were tested. The number of occupants against each colour of the different pairs were analyzed by the χ2-test and Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment. The data were converted into mean z-scores and significant biases from zero were noted. Underwater visibility of each colour shelter was visually measured through a waterproof digital CCD camera. The crabs showed a strong bias for blue shelter and white shelter chosen the least under the holding condition. The underwater visibility was highest in blue and white colour shelters among the six colour shelters. The observed colour preference was probably due to colour per se and may be an innate ability, rather than due to relative underwater visibility. During the observations, the shelter occupants were tolerant of intruders; there was no aggressive competition for shelter and two to four crabs shared one shelter. It was hypothesized that the touch stimulus of shelter suppresses the aggressiveness and results in low cannibalism of S. tranquebarica.",225,,104966,,Geography; Scylla tranquebarica; White colour; Ccd camera; Fishery; Cannibalism,,,,Universiti Malaysia Sabah; Special Fund Scheme,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159120300447,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2020.104966,,10.1016/j.applanim.2020.104966,3006062411,,0,000-494-741-488-211; 001-343-869-664-681; 002-556-206-771-887; 002-849-011-718-786; 010-992-896-861-695; 014-057-296-874-474; 017-630-520-214-189; 017-669-945-658-031; 017-773-414-338-16X; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-362-509-349-649; 037-912-631-519-568; 038-570-244-604-470; 041-368-017-838-313; 045-821-799-414-926; 049-671-058-690-987; 050-783-590-316-934; 051-604-253-784-956; 051-722-732-519-647; 053-382-206-333-054; 057-774-608-902-457; 059-411-165-090-129; 061-395-393-463-630; 061-751-973-942-476; 067-884-864-375-166; 071-524-165-870-34X; 071-974-867-812-070; 076-213-397-951-695; 078-987-232-904-382; 080-137-393-822-426; 083-408-772-069-543; 087-847-245-253-12X; 089-312-662-231-345; 091-053-215-619-805; 106-677-551-628-012; 110-198-174-957-588; 111-606-802-262-880; 113-062-263-667-781; 115-653-000-869-768; 121-365-725-443-415; 124-897-955-068-661; 133-813-403-518-113; 137-182-583-132-273; 141-026-919-759-564; 143-922-002-872-045; 149-126-231-139-171; 155-246-484-983-85X; 159-666-285-245-543; 161-477-214-888-129; 182-206-047-160-276; 195-856-505-072-65X,1

Recently, numerosity discrimination (i.e., how many items are in a set) has been shown to be resilient to healthy ageing despite relying on inhibitory skills, but whether processing continuous quantities such as time and space is equally well-maintained in ageing participants is not known. Life-long exposure to quantity-related problems may progressively refine proficiency in quantity tasks, or alternatively quantity skills may decline with age. In addition, is not known whether the tight relationship between quantity dimensions typically shown in their interactions is preserved in ageing. To address these questions, two experimental paradigms were used in 38 younger and 32 older healthy adults who showed typical age-related decline in attention, executive function and memory tasks. In both groups we first assessed time and space discrimination independently using a two-choice task (i.e., ""Which of two horizontal lines is longer in duration or extension?""), and found that time and space processing were equally accurate in younger and older participants. In a second paradigm, we assessed the relation between different quantity dimensions which were presented as a dynamic pattern of dots independently changing in duration, spatial extension and numerosity. Younger and older participants again showed a similar profile of interaction between number, cumulative area and duration, although older adults showed a greater sensitivity to task-irrelevant information than younger adults in the cumulative area task but lower sensitivity in the duration task. Continuous quantity processing seems therefore resilient to ageing similar to numerosity and to other non-quantity skills like vocabulary or implicit memory; however, ageing might differentially affect different quantity dimensions.",4,,865,865,Psychological resilience; Developmental psychology; Implicit memory; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Vocabulary; Younger adults; Dynamic pattern; Healthy ageing; Ageing,ageing; magnitude system; number; quantity processing; space; time,,,Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3857545 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00865/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24339818 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00865/abstract https://philarchive.org/rec/LAMADN-2 https://openaccess.city.ac.uk/id/eprint/7170/ https://doaj.org/article/bb25306014404769b870bc8112cbf3f6 https://core.ac.uk/display/82842200 https://philpapers.org/rec/LAMADN-2 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Anna_Lambrechts/publication/259337150_Age_does_not_count_resilience_of_quantity_processing_in_healthy_ageing/links/00b4952a6e0e6531a9000000.pdf http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1433469/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82842200.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00865,24339818,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00865,2129651654,PMC3857545,0,001-244-253-407-376; 002-436-897-206-812; 005-245-237-971-874; 005-250-740-558-573; 005-511-550-795-992; 005-567-735-413-367; 005-625-026-347-080; 005-835-426-532-723; 005-881-575-136-027; 007-562-693-801-934; 007-996-363-197-55X; 008-817-891-248-429; 008-944-478-607-59X; 009-132-265-301-952; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-280-224-459-100; 011-637-143-375-49X; 012-031-655-002-814; 013-115-977-730-675; 013-309-416-132-777; 014-681-713-990-898; 015-630-061-354-429; 015-804-916-995-414; 016-046-921-135-036; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-661-112-251-592; 016-821-170-460-739; 021-594-242-952-120; 022-601-658-145-268; 022-988-712-445-94X; 024-607-781-626-606; 026-803-444-839-337; 026-904-446-310-931; 027-175-169-076-225; 028-793-089-543-473; 031-324-485-402-628; 033-089-141-217-934; 033-169-511-405-546; 033-527-001-452-462; 034-681-894-917-854; 034-982-292-185-771; 035-143-942-540-296; 039-055-983-385-865; 039-866-525-488-655; 040-890-157-331-851; 041-323-502-321-36X; 044-451-087-503-048; 044-789-282-522-154; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-952-966-839-251; 050-789-048-535-501; 050-948-703-592-234; 051-301-074-196-640; 052-473-462-827-560; 055-643-503-860-593; 057-349-983-849-38X; 058-465-268-253-776; 059-428-734-687-752; 060-060-795-093-483; 061-381-296-273-328; 062-048-899-665-467; 065-767-396-762-003; 067-033-829-394-657; 067-613-008-303-077; 069-697-398-285-815; 070-983-211-803-268; 071-484-945-510-86X; 078-484-411-072-492; 079-868-710-530-712; 083-680-277-916-656; 085-580-305-628-673; 088-224-814-828-823; 090-357-903-385-682; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-680-088-559-537; 099-402-117-922-142; 101-070-484-973-162; 103-974-904-022-158; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-653-441-155-254; 108-088-218-086-51X; 108-662-452-499-578; 118-581-038-700-756; 123-363-250-779-508; 123-432-042-579-428; 127-930-296-287-932; 133-323-798-067-270; 137-459-098-890-950; 138-123-536-023-767; 144-405-908-801-594; 144-747-377-111-26X; 153-174-100-314-196; 155-590-493-745-223; 167-544-226-338-226,10

Here, we analyze causes attributed to such behaviors by car drivers in a self-report study. We explore the relationships between the dimensions of causal attribution, attribution of responsibility for the near crash, and drivers' comparative judgments. Method For approximately two months, drivers used logbooks to document the near crashes that occurred during their trips. The causes attributed in those reports to driving behaviors resulting in near crashes were then coded by two judges on the basis of several causal dimensions. Drivers also estimated their own and an average driver's skill levels, and their risk of being involved, as a driver, in a crash. Results We distinguished main types of causes of the near crashes reported. Drivers had a tendency to more often attribute external causes to their own behaviors resulting in near crashes than to those of others. The probability of attributing a controllable cause increased with overestimation of one's own skills and decreased with underestimation of one's own risk in comparison to other drivers. The probability of attributing a stable cause increased with underestimation of one's own risk. Conclusions When they explained their own behaviors resulting in near crashes, drivers mentioned different causes than when they explained those of others. Overestimation of one's own skills as compared to other drivers could be beneficial for developing crash-avoiding skills, insofar as it seems to foster attribution of controllable causes. By contrast, underestimation of one's own risk could have the opposite effect. Practical applications Vulnerability to road risks should be stressed in driver’s training and risk communication campaigns. However, self-confidence with respect to one's skills should not always be targeted as a safety problem.",65,,133,139,Attribution; Psychology; Risk perception; Human factors and ergonomics; Crash; Vulnerability; Injury prevention; Dangerous driving; Poison control; Social psychology,Accident prevention; Cognition; Driving; Psychology; Risk perception,"Accidents, Traffic/psychology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Automobile Driving/psychology; Dangerous Behavior; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Self Concept; Self Report; Young Adult",,Fondation MAIF,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29776522 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002243751730600X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jsr.2018.02.009,29776522,10.1016/j.jsr.2018.02.009,2800296649,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 002-192-085-265-35X; 003-475-354-542-631; 004-502-447-528-115; 004-554-646-498-005; 005-194-955-812-520; 011-229-516-651-416; 011-868-989-868-00X; 012-711-607-971-687; 016-334-948-524-927; 017-036-334-611-429; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-623-056-034-186; 021-329-296-844-216; 022-452-880-041-236; 029-871-092-790-771; 035-823-189-049-040; 036-982-751-344-552; 041-860-680-626-354; 042-575-131-829-363; 055-102-405-954-332; 063-729-501-142-712; 065-375-022-074-676; 070-879-097-431-906; 074-331-217-488-467; 077-051-218-732-25X; 084-912-379-463-252; 094-069-550-267-195; 096-997-372-337-561; 107-678-231-644-33X; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-469-059-159-61X; 135-712-064-433-27X; 142-472-241-135-796; 145-067-363-239-702; 153-607-011-083-69X; 159-148-645-453-793; 162-669-007-133-80X; 170-501-388-007-997; 191-562-920-349-020,1

This presented an important attempt at theoretically integrating data across various literatures, and became very influential (e.g., Burr et al., 2010; Lourenco and Longo, 2011; Bonato et al., 2012).

The model uses stated-preference data in a random-utility framework to predict adoption rates for new pharmaceutical products. In addition, this paper employs a Markov model of patient learning in drug selection. While the simple learning rule presented here is only a rough approximation to reality, this model nevertheless systematically incorporates important features including learning and the influence of shifting preferences on market share. Despite its simplifications, the integrated framework of random-utility and product attribute updating presented here is capable of accommodating a variety of pharmaceutical marketing and development problems.

Results from three experiments on complete-facial expressions (happy/angry) and mixed-facial expressions (neutral/happy-or-angry) pairs viewed with (Experiment 1 and 3) or without (Experiment 2) foveation and performed in conditions in which valence was either task relevant (Experiment 1 and 2) or task irrelevant (Experiment 3), show that comparative judgements of emotions are stimulus driven. Judgements' speed increased as the target absolute emotion intensity grew larger together with the average emotion of the pair, irrespective of the compatibility between the valence and the side of motor response: a semantic congruency effect in the domain of emotion. This result undermines previous interpretation of results in the context of comparative judgements based on the lateralization of emotions (e.g., SNARC-like instructional flexibility), and is fully consistent with our formalization of emotional semantic congruency: the direct Speed-Intensity Association model.",190,,20,41,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Facial expression; Everyday life; Association model; Emotion intensity; Expression (mathematics); Lateralization of brain function,Emotion; Facial expressions; SNARC effect; Semantic congruency; Spatial attention; Spatial representation,Adolescent; Adult; Emotions; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reaction Time; Semantics; Young Adult,,Regione Autonoma Friuli Venezia Giulia; Università degli Studi di Trieste,https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2946481 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022649 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300988 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/17719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.014,31022649,10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.014,2938536385,,0,001-180-593-948-224; 001-309-649-467-687; 001-736-503-518-484; 001-995-708-037-242; 002-244-821-401-703; 003-086-472-590-707; 003-683-845-316-328; 004-347-722-689-662; 004-731-567-191-050; 004-986-612-800-738; 005-411-361-675-678; 005-848-485-027-260; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-101-878-246-410; 008-323-657-407-735; 009-007-905-689-025; 009-351-777-389-759; 009-638-275-134-279; 009-804-637-120-597; 010-234-048-802-227; 012-765-147-718-763; 013-465-817-942-505; 014-196-575-179-503; 014-347-760-732-628; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-803-870-149-321; 016-000-197-860-064; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-286-539-418-329; 016-943-586-292-076; 017-411-204-124-990; 017-709-793-678-757; 017-797-479-052-054; 018-765-388-536-256; 018-781-528-222-92X; 019-905-723-784-862; 022-256-358-084-69X; 025-000-409-955-652; 025-498-067-077-896; 025-703-813-430-701; 025-971-418-331-624; 026-380-955-565-508; 027-012-971-940-520; 028-421-417-276-988; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-687-213-835-004; 032-237-252-273-598; 033-527-001-452-462; 035-211-639-161-455; 035-229-209-474-238; 035-522-074-408-50X; 035-845-186-028-970; 036-459-179-538-121; 036-786-901-847-684; 037-046-955-586-195; 037-954-908-422-335; 038-642-909-156-167; 038-672-801-676-993; 043-603-131-662-278; 043-712-703-777-381; 045-614-713-034-892; 046-522-618-604-832; 046-787-115-596-360; 047-449-480-741-911; 047-791-541-584-58X; 048-889-201-158-674; 048-939-869-477-889; 049-092-751-377-693; 049-863-149-640-914; 051-066-076-538-547; 051-390-659-369-102; 051-466-119-337-423; 051-472-129-782-759; 051-812-097-931-69X; 052-496-408-784-733; 053-972-825-127-532; 054-100-154-295-161; 054-649-302-531-591; 054-722-084-317-703; 057-183-336-446-253; 058-175-340-486-49X; 059-972-740-229-626; 061-215-565-452-575; 063-223-495-189-224; 063-600-110-576-241; 063-605-503-678-532; 064-938-778-968-688; 066-608-905-207-154; 066-877-300-844-287; 067-852-505-761-499; 073-851-694-732-402; 076-581-189-154-711; 076-975-705-961-977; 077-955-155-009-954; 078-649-785-249-179; 079-082-211-428-444; 080-496-777-408-835; 081-260-990-315-81X; 082-479-245-913-353; 082-927-142-328-510; 084-837-414-058-221; 085-756-973-622-409; 086-011-582-380-107; 086-214-041-467-250; 087-173-196-464-44X; 087-300-622-382-439; 088-540-204-090-045; 089-363-620-591-465; 090-473-073-536-194; 096-974-841-889-042; 097-118-699-603-908; 100-207-668-556-96X; 100-668-664-094-130; 101-033-639-064-930; 102-141-448-781-894; 105-173-140-212-64X; 105-942-707-129-817; 106-197-189-659-701; 109-190-390-581-587; 109-226-228-744-589; 112-410-962-878-600; 114-992-167-812-755; 115-169-209-648-291; 115-972-804-337-028; 116-953-283-915-381; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-076-869-929-345; 123-478-664-171-99X; 123-588-598-381-661; 125-126-582-214-822; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 131-863-163-235-044; 141-730-925-182-377; 142-970-748-022-995; 149-229-185-800-505; 168-043-103-603-780; 177-913-457-382-682; 196-022-041-043-935,4

To maximise reliability and validity, the literature recommends adopting various design principles including the use of explicit assessment criteria. Counter to this literature, we report a peer assessment exercise in which criteria were deliberately avoided yet acceptable reliability and validity were achieved. Based on this finding, we make two arguments. First, the comparative judgement approach adopted can be applied successfully in different contexts, including higher education and secondary school. Second, the success was due to this approach; an alternative technique based on absolute judgement yielded poor reliability and validity.

Den Otter,"<p>Although several American legal scholars have defended the constitutional right to marry more than one person at the same time on substantive due process or equal-protection grounds, few have underscored the possibility that plural marriage could be beneficial. The standard liberal approach eschews comparative judgments between monogamy and polyamory, ultimately depending on the value of the exercise of autonomy for its own sake. The problem is that those who employ it must remain reticent about the benefits that the legal recognition of polyamorous marriage may produce. In this chapter, I formulate an atypical constitutional argument for polyamorous marriage, drawing inspiration from John Stuart Mill’s well-known idea of experiments of living, rooted in the benefits of unconventional beliefs and practices. I try to explain why polyamory can be a superior marital arrangement for some people under some circumstances. Such marital experiments also may assist polyamorists in becoming better human beings.</p>",,,,,Sociology,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198786429.003.0005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780198786429.003.0005,,10.1093/oso/9780198786429.003.0005,2799536269,,0,,1

Steedle; Steve Ferrara,"ABSTRACTAs an alternative to rubric scoring, comparative judgment generates essay scores by aggregating decisions about the relative quality of the essays. Comparative judgment eliminates certain scorer biases and potentially reduces training requirements, thereby allowing a large number of judges, including teachers, to participate in essay evaluation. The purpose of this study was to assess the validity, labor costs, and efficiency of comparative judgments as a potential substitute for rubric scoring. An analysis of two essay prompts revealed that comparative judgment measures were comparable to rubric scores at a level similar to that expected of two professional scorers. The comparative judgment measures correlated slightly higher than rubric scores with a multiple-choice writing test. Score reliability exceeding .80 was achieved with approximately nine judgments per response. The average judgment time was 94 seconds, which compared favorably to 119 seconds per rubric score.

022-501-390-008-829,SPECTRAL METHOD AND REGULARIZED MLE ARE BOTH OPTIMAL FOR TOP-K RANKING.,2019-05-21,2019,journal article,Annals of statistics,00905364,Institute of Mathematical Statistics,United States,Yuxin Chen; Jianqing Fan; Cong Ma; Kaizheng Wang,"This paper is concerned with the problem of top-$K$ ranking from pairwise comparisons. Given a collection of $n$ items and a few pairwise comparisons across them, one wishes to identify the set of $K$ items that receive the highest ranks. To tackle this problem, we adopt the logistic parametric model—the Bradley–Terry–Luce model, where each item is assigned a latent preference score, and where the outcome of each pairwise comparison depends solely on the relative scores of the two items involved. Recent works have made significant progress toward characterizing the performance (e.g., the mean square error for estimating the scores) of several classical methods, including the spectral method and the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). However, where they stand regarding top-$K$ ranking remains unsettled.We demonstrate that under a natural random sampling model, the spectral method alone, or the regularized MLE alone, is minimax optimal in terms of the sample complexity—the number of paired comparisons needed to ensure exact top-$K$ identification, for the fixed dynamic range regime. This is accomplished via optimal control of the entrywise error of the score estimates. We complement our theoretical studies by numerical experiments, confirming that both methods yield low entrywise errors for estimating the underlying scores. Our theory is established via a novel leave-one-out trick, which proves effective for analyzing both iterative and noniterative procedures. Along the way, we derive an elementary eigenvector perturbation bound for probability transition matrices, which parallels the Davis–Kahan $\mathop{\mathrm{sin}}\nolimits \Theta $ theorem for symmetric matrices. This also allows us to close the gap between the $\ell_{2}$ error upper bound for the spectral method and the minimax lower limit.",47,4,2204,2235,Parametric statistics; Mean squared error; Minimax; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Symmetric matrix; Upper and lower bounds; Statistics; Mean squared error; Minimax; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Parametric model; Mathematics; Upper and lower bounds; Optimal control,entrywise perturbation; leave-one-out analysis; pairwise comparisons; regularized MLE; reversible Markov chains; spectral method; top-K ranking,,,NIGMS NIH HHS (R01 GM072611) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6785035 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1707.html#ChenFMW17 https://projecteuclid.org/journals/annals-of-statistics/volume-47/issue-4/Spectral-method-and-regularized-MLE-are-both-optimal-for-top/10.1214/18-AOS1745.full https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017arXiv170709971C/abstract https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.09971.pdf http://arxiv-export-lb.library.cornell.edu/abs/1707.09971 https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.09971,http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/18-aos1745,31598016,10.1214/18-aos1745,3099973750; 2739848020,PMC6785035,0,001-004-209-528-581; 016-390-369-973-732; 024-388-746-087-638; 026-830-212-717-705; 052-731-553-260-693; 060-805-911-796-631; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-440-208-613-022; 068-785-554-179-242; 075-539-693-388-757; 080-343-151-945-404; 116-623-220-259-127; 162-709-805-856-344; 181-375-967-075-390,42

However, little is known about whether the spatial layout of the display stand (i.e., its shape) may influence consumers’ evaluation of the product and their purchase intention. The present research aims to investigate the role of the shape of an in-store display as a contextual cue potentially able to influence consumers’ evaluation of the exposed product and their subsequent purchasing intention. Two experiments were carried out in which we manipulated the shape of the product holder and the brand name as a function of brand awareness. We found that a meaningful shape representing the product induced a more positive product evaluation and indirectly, a greater intention to purchase in respect to shelf, when the product was a little-known brand (Study 1). Furthermore, the strongest effect occurred when the display stand facilitated product affordance in consumers’ minds (Study 2). These results confirmed that the ability of the immediate context (i.e., the display stand) to evoke an action with an object (the product) influences the perceiver evaluation and behavioral intention towards the object itself. Theoretical and practical implications of the findings are discussed.",34,2,447,465,Advertising; Brand awareness; Psychology; Affordance; Purchasing; Brand names; Practical implications; Social psychology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-014-9268-8 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-014-9268-8 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12144-014-9268-8/fulltext.html https://iris.unimore.it/handle/11380/1067986,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12144-014-9268-8,,10.1007/s12144-014-9268-8,2011771300,,0,000-220-323-196-453; 002-011-802-041-290; 005-086-601-834-177; 007-415-709-858-979; 009-479-921-119-028; 010-051-385-991-733; 013-626-063-612-802; 013-890-349-480-326; 014-690-653-769-749; 017-140-340-026-883; 021-913-845-548-712; 024-815-787-987-361; 027-722-733-402-627; 031-435-333-872-040; 033-874-352-343-694; 034-655-701-858-335; 035-126-476-411-571; 036-111-353-169-943; 043-678-420-669-35X; 044-398-804-481-25X; 046-047-887-327-781; 046-284-183-100-449; 049-684-060-978-341; 050-292-840-543-325; 056-086-068-366-642; 059-859-454-431-546; 070-539-727-785-16X; 071-804-531-681-140; 075-605-486-813-573; 080-606-994-278-285; 099-699-218-247-780; 100-700-317-514-185; 102-555-702-781-751; 105-940-278-037-172; 120-005-493-397-169; 125-325-544-309-515; 128-198-376-901-930; 137-944-249-888-399; 140-091-581-050-105; 149-016-266-154-26X; 149-942-899-361-325; 152-568-075-650-141; 161-112-620-465-795; 184-154-875-647-400; 191-511-269-268-378,1

Brown; Karim Malik,"Wilms' tumour (WT) is a pediatric tumor of the kidney that arises via failure of the fetal developmental program. The absence of identifiable mutations in the majority of WTs suggests the frequent involvement of epigenetic aberrations in WT. We therefore conducted a genome-wide analysis of promoter hypermethylation in WTs and identified hypermethylation at chromosome 5q31 spanning 800 kilobases (kb) and more than 50 genes. The methylated genes all belong to alpha-, beta-, and gamma-protocadherin (PCDH) gene clusters (Human Genome Organization nomenclature PCDHA@, PCDHB@, and PCDHG@, respectively). This demonstrates that long-range epigenetic silencing (LRES) occurs in developmental tumors as well as in adult tumors. Bisulfite polymerase chain reaction analysis showed that PCDH hypermethylation is a frequent event found in all Wilms' tumor subtypes. Hypermethylation is concordant with reduced PCDH expression in tumors. WT precursor lesions showed no PCDH hypermethylation, suggesting that de novo PCDH hypermethylation occurs during malignant progression. Discrete boundaries of the PCDH domain are delimited by abrupt changes in histone modifications; unmethylated genes flanking the LRES are associated with permissive marks which are absent from methylated genes within the domain. Silenced genes are marked with non-permissive histone 3 lysine 9 dimethylation. Expression analysis of embryonic murine kidney and differentiating rat metanephric mesenchymal cells demonstrates that Pcdh expression is developmentally regulated and that Pcdhg@ genes are expressed in blastemal cells. Importantly, we show that PCDHs negatively regulate canonical Wnt signalling, as short-interfering RNA-induced reduction of PCDHG@ encoded proteins leads to elevated beta-catenin protein, increased beta-catenin/T-cell factor (TCF) reporter activity, and induction of Wnt target genes. Conversely, over-expression of PCDHs suppresses beta-catenin/TCF-reporter activity and also inhibits colony formation and growth of cancer cells in soft agar. Thus PCDHs are candidate tumor suppressors that modulate regulatory pathways critical in development and disease, such as canonical Wnt signaling.",5,11,e1000745,,Gene silencing; Wnt signaling pathway; Molecular biology; Protocadherin; Regulation of gene expression; DNA methylation; Wilms' tumor; Epigenetics; Histone; Biology,,"Animals; Cadherins/genetics; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 5/genetics; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene Silencing; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Mice; Multigene Family; Promoter Regions, Genetic/genetics; Rats; Signal Transduction/genetics; Wilms Tumor/genetics; Wnt Proteins/genetics; beta Catenin/genetics","Cadherins; PCDH1 protein, human; Wnt Proteins; beta Catenin",Medical Research Council (G0300415) United Kingdom,https://purehost.bath.ac.uk/ws/files/327581/journal.pgen.1000745.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19956686 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/frequent-longrange-epigenetic-silencing-of-protocadherin-gene-clusters-on-chromosome-5q31-in-wilms-tumor(f1ee96dc-c091-477a-a179-ede6e0fd7ac9).html http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2791684 https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/frequent-longrange-epigenetic-silencing-of-protocadherin-gene-clusters-on-chromosome-5q31-in-wilms-tumor(d772764b-ca7b-4d1d-8a3c-e3e2a26488aa).html https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/frequent-long-range-epigenetic-silencing-of-protocadherin-gene-cl https://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/en/publications/frequent-longrange-epigenetic-silencing-of-protocadherin-gene-clusters-on-chromosome-5q31-in-wilms-tumor(f1ee96dc-c091-477a-a179-ede6e0fd7ac9).html https://core.ac.uk/display/2804826 https://paperity.org/p/61723571/frequent-long-range-epigenetic-silencing-of-protocadherin-gene-clusters-on-chromosome http://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/8144707/Frequent_long_range_epigenetic_silencing_of_protocadherin_gene_clusters_on_chromosome_5q31_in_Wilms_tumor.pdf https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745 http://journals.plos.org/plosgenetics/article?id=10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745 http://opus.bath.ac.uk/17432/1/journal.pgen.1000745.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745,19956686,10.1371/journal.pgen.1000745,2172097912,PMC2776977,1,000-508-169-978-651; 001-541-140-911-980; 006-496-128-693-505; 007-791-601-800-977; 008-587-496-850-953; 008-754-810-127-348; 008-863-047-058-192; 009-505-032-719-396; 009-629-179-980-235; 010-742-620-693-123; 011-696-579-677-624; 012-796-935-773-175; 013-264-428-649-873; 014-243-442-542-259; 015-640-749-747-983; 015-722-967-723-874; 016-238-271-794-06X; 017-488-572-307-390; 025-975-141-128-33X; 027-004-432-207-805; 028-760-208-905-684; 030-882-516-342-251; 033-902-318-744-107; 034-421-372-579-025; 035-489-640-956-411; 036-237-089-182-180; 037-501-916-004-748; 037-554-584-719-470; 037-603-711-130-377; 037-796-070-520-466; 037-990-992-780-933; 041-191-107-770-85X; 042-071-940-816-299; 045-729-616-904-489; 047-312-836-061-46X; 048-268-954-056-427; 051-257-734-164-471; 051-498-032-803-432; 051-610-905-935-926; 055-808-738-460-159; 055-897-764-514-074; 057-813-368-096-810; 061-286-403-236-114; 062-216-941-550-445; 074-486-124-806-91X; 076-928-016-717-061; 077-637-974-092-348; 078-647-620-407-651; 086-571-675-408-469; 089-271-032-341-138; 111-236-714-735-531; 113-496-591-885-436; 116-985-943-727-033; 123-896-602-181-684; 129-144-964-071-112; 161-436-870-971-261,131

Ravi,"A number of applications (e.g., AI bot tournaments, sports, peer grading, crowdsourcing) use pairwise comparison data and the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model to evaluate a given collection of items (e.g., bots, teams, students, search results). Past work has shown that under the BTL model, the widely-used maximum-likelihood estimator (MLE) is minimax-optimal in estimating the item parameters, in terms of the mean squared error. However, another important desideratum for designing estimators is fairness. In this work, we consider fairness modeled by the notion of bias in statistics. We show that the MLE incurs a suboptimal rate in terms of bias. We then propose a simple modification to the MLE, which ""stretches"" the bounding box of the maximum-likelihood optimizer by a small constant factor from the underlying ground truth domain. We show that this simple modification leads to an improved rate in bias, while maintaining minimax-optimality in the mean squared error. In this manner, our proposed class of estimators provably improves fairness represented by bias without loss in accuracy.",,,,,Statistics; Mean squared error; Ground truth; Minimum bounding box; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Constant factor; Peer grading; Computer science; Crowdsourcing,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04066 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04066 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.04066.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1906.04066,https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.04066,,,2948522254,,0,040-237-436-898-162; 050-943-988-713-681; 087-991-691-200-809; 184-642-983-014-865,1

The present study examined how falsely recognizing versus correctly rejecting target-related foils in an initial recognition test affects target identification in a second, delayed recognition test. In three experiments, subjects first encoded a large set of target images, and then participated in two recognition tests that were separated by 48 h. Experiment 1 revealed that false recognitions of target-related foils in Test 1 did not negatively affect target identifications in Test 2. Surprisingly, however, correct rejections of target-related foils in Test 1 were associated with increased target misses at Test 2. Two follow-up experiments examined possible mechanisms for the increased target misses after correct rejections. Experiment 2 determined that correct rejections in Test 1 did not lead to enhanced foil memory that might have blocked access to memory for target details in Test 2. Experiment 3 showed that target misses persisted when the second recognition test did not involve any comparative judgments and therefore mismatched the format of the first recognition test. Taken together, these findings suggest that subjects can easily recover from false recognitions when provided with the necessary retrieval cues; yet, initial correct rejections bias later memory responses toward rejection, such that over time, rejections generalize to targets.",57,57,67,81,Psychology; Speech recognition; Visual recognition; Delayed recognition; Social psychology,,,,Pennsylvania Department of Health,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023969016300911 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0023969016300911 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-6d2d9ebf-92cd-31f6-9483-66e230741236,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lmot.2016.10.002,,10.1016/j.lmot.2016.10.002,2548563582,,0,002-115-255-928-621; 005-018-084-161-650; 007-039-756-604-721; 007-736-568-287-822; 007-777-842-497-170; 008-067-062-122-781; 008-686-653-610-923; 010-150-302-588-978; 010-634-292-835-779; 015-430-727-574-297; 019-733-822-541-841; 024-051-502-023-650; 026-756-170-012-519; 027-147-885-076-455; 027-528-345-286-872; 031-497-630-489-279; 033-106-519-796-256; 038-470-692-758-74X; 040-805-715-407-752; 045-266-825-185-291; 048-259-276-823-839; 050-713-576-978-276; 050-818-649-734-717; 051-699-862-264-635; 053-361-922-919-627; 055-408-827-896-285; 056-400-432-366-677; 057-985-761-274-397; 058-946-815-137-465; 073-366-667-185-977; 078-265-278-611-687; 092-913-094-983-638; 097-284-859-969-831; 098-045-099-939-741; 102-639-466-518-342; 107-981-236-124-538; 113-466-164-836-35X; 122-629-240-946-455; 130-190-146-514-578; 183-983-280-226-369,1

Using some environment, we can estimate the relative failure rate through the help of experts’ experiment, and then get the real failure rate for wires. To analysis the effect of environment on EWIS failure rate, we compared the relative failure rate for different environment groups. The result of comparisons shows that non-realistic failure rates may improve the estimate conservative of relative EWIS failure rate.",17,,473,479,Interconnection; Engineering; Failure rate; Reliability engineering; Airworthiness; Aircraft safety; Electrical wire; Electrical wiring; Mathematical model,,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view/1419413 https://core.ac.uk/display/82568097 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705811027366 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82568097.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.proeng.2011.10.057,,10.1016/j.proeng.2011.10.057,1975745676,,0,011-105-391-999-886; 015-893-359-960-186; 035-776-610-863-582; 046-268-778-644-875; 060-623-327-109-647; 113-278-954-446-219; 113-528-521-012-561; 115-227-676-181-291,0

While the most widely used method is the eigenvector method, the row geometric mean approach has gained popularity due to its mathematical properties and its ease of implementation. In this paper, we discuss a spanning tree method and prove the mathematical equivalence of its preference vector to that of the row geometric mean approach. This is an important finding due to the fact that it identifies an approach for generating a preference vector which has the mathematical properties of the row geometric mean preference vector, and yet, in its entirety, the spanning tree method has more to offer than the row geometric mean method, in that, it is inherently applicable to incomplete sets of pairwise comparison judgements, and also facilitates the use of statistical and visual techniques to gain insights into inconsistency in the DM’s judgements.",257,1,197,208,Algorithm; Discrete mathematics; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Equivalence (measure theory); Pairwise comparison; Decision analysis; Preference analysis; Mathematics; Geometric mean; Spanning tree; Graph theory,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v257y2017i1p197-208.html https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-mathematical-equivalence-of-the-spanning-tree-and-row-geometric-mean-preference-vectors-and-its-implications-for-preference-analysis(97b20ba8-d9cc-44f7-8535-310839cf7b3c).html http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/102699/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221716305975 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/5001410/GRECO_The_mathematical_equivalence_of_the_spanning_tree_and_row_geometric_mean_preference_vectors_and_its_implications_for_preference_analysis.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221716305975 https://core.ac.uk/display/77049218 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor257.html#LundySG17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042,,10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042,2490314309,,0,003-354-918-233-842; 003-895-320-956-909; 006-020-375-701-986; 007-631-450-649-532; 009-881-393-198-900; 011-837-366-431-74X; 015-050-303-686-75X; 020-742-339-077-241; 021-004-860-280-453; 021-444-151-543-58X; 026-358-629-546-378; 027-976-997-688-454; 028-461-975-568-965; 032-988-626-764-349; 034-298-311-251-930; 043-847-158-555-238; 044-016-504-410-808; 047-108-373-485-451; 048-291-955-168-581; 052-115-966-839-821; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-718-392-672-185; 060-974-072-936-96X; 061-703-176-018-76X; 067-143-980-711-210; 067-297-975-089-254; 068-133-038-272-957; 069-378-081-758-372; 071-102-883-546-413; 078-500-602-804-841; 086-993-701-614-697; 091-996-940-963-047; 098-880-905-772-456; 106-967-560-410-264; 116-317-784-317-788; 150-330-303-457-122,27
023-251-897-101-800,Are absolute and comparative judgements about road traffic-risks inherent in speeding realistic? A study among French traffic regulation offenders,,2014,journal article,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,13698478,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Cécile Martha; Patricia Delhomme,"Abstract A few studies have shown that road users can express realistic risk judgements, in the sense that they perceive higher risk when their behavior is in fact riskier. Our aim was to examine whether the realism of absolute and comparative judgements about speeding risks could be found among an at-risk driver population made of 539 French traffic regulation offenders taking a driving licence points recovery course. The results showed that course takers’ absolute judgements regarding speeding-ticket risk were realistic: the more course-takers had the intention to drive fast and reported driving-related sensation-seeking (DRSS), the more they evaluated themselves as being at risk of having a speeding-ticket. The realism was also observed when considering comparative judgements regarding speeding-ticket risk, but only among the more than 25 years old participants. Moreover, the realism was not observed when considering course takers’ absolute and comparative judgements regarding speeding-induced crash risk. Hence, it is important to increase communication about the dangerousness of speeding among specific groups such as traffic regulation offenders, above all among young course takers who reported high speeds and DRSS.",26,,126,137,Engineering; Human factors and ergonomics; Occupational safety and health; Injury prevention; Population; Traffic regulation; Poison control; Suicide prevention; Realism; Social psychology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847814000874 https://trid.trb.org/view/1325304 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847814000874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2014.06.013,,10.1016/j.trf.2014.06.013,1973768921,,0,000-401-633-250-390; 000-823-132-288-614; 000-999-951-820-28X; 001-539-529-845-798; 003-498-762-032-886; 004-949-838-366-871; 005-144-613-482-837; 005-877-301-064-706; 007-613-518-980-709; 011-229-516-651-416; 011-381-212-740-627; 011-397-141-989-21X; 013-193-621-934-101; 014-954-259-079-367; 015-230-677-876-783; 017-672-929-943-884; 022-909-146-372-273; 024-838-013-412-523; 028-054-628-087-376; 030-615-666-969-205; 031-996-190-068-361; 032-305-380-733-87X; 032-825-855-562-840; 035-118-730-307-332; 038-840-802-711-607; 040-269-259-341-705; 041-860-680-626-354; 053-631-545-301-764; 054-838-615-271-826; 057-506-397-116-307; 057-761-715-276-049; 058-792-998-449-306; 062-333-668-983-145; 062-616-914-957-859; 064-751-787-047-012; 069-129-502-119-839; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-850-977-359-272; 074-331-217-488-467; 074-912-140-708-016; 079-096-954-600-943; 079-556-927-686-475; 080-239-236-802-672; 081-831-605-583-508; 087-208-348-924-212; 088-869-229-566-701; 090-506-396-354-334; 090-730-952-095-457; 095-904-683-660-006; 097-247-171-152-329; 107-854-421-865-889; 130-650-268-245-489; 136-212-907-362-920; 137-662-770-635-40X; 142-165-678-190-624; 145-067-363-239-702; 150-007-348-151-864; 152-633-318-433-765; 153-385-948-209-094; 158-444-232-588-710; 161-266-888-079-125; 194-340-079-194-828,4

Accordingly, it is important to understand the building blocks of numerical cognition, the neural tissue involved, and the developmental trajectories. In the last two decades research has made impressive strides forward in studying numerical cognition and brain mechanisms involved in arithmetic. This advance was marked by suggestions of a numerical core system that can be characterized as a set of intuitions for quantities innately available to humans (Brannon et al., 2006) and animals (Cantlon and Brannon, 2007). We suggest that another system, evolved to perceive and evaluate non-countable dimensions like size or amount of substance may be important for the evolution of the numerical system and numerical abilities.

023-629-840-137-345,On The Complexity of Eliminating Fuel Subsidy in Indonesia; A Behavioral Approach,,2012,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Rimawan Pradiptyo; Gumilang Aryo Sahadewo,"People’s attachment to a subsidy creates difficulties for the government to phase out, and eventually eliminate, the subsidy. Elimination of fuel subsidy scheme in Indonesia is a perfect example of such occurrence. The subsidy has been implementing to commodity as opposed to households, thus individuals may not necessarily realized that they have been enjoying the subsidy when they buy fuel. In this case people may feel as if they are endowed by the values from the provision of the policy. The elimination of the subsidy consequently may be perceived as a loss - as opposed to a foregone gain. ; This study aims to obtain the most acceptable exit strategy to eliminate the subsidy from the perspective of households by conducting a laboratory-based survey. The alternative exit strategies include methods of elimination of the subsidy and of reallocation of resources saved from eliminating the subsidy. The policy options have been derived using insight from behavioral economics ranging from endowment effect, status quo bias, to present biasness. ; The survey includes 335 subjects, who come from four different backgrounds: 1) households with no motor vehicle; 2) households with only motorcycle(s); (3) households with one car and; 4) households with one luxurious car or more than one car. Each subject faces 55 paired-wise policy alternatives and the method proposed by Dunn-Rankin (1983) has been used to derive the ordering of preferences.; The result shows that gradual elimination of fuel subsidy and reallocation to earmarked programs were the most acceptable policy elements of the exit strategy. The survey, indirectly, showed that subjects’ valuation of losses is greater for direct elimination strategies than that of the equivalent gradual elimination strategies. The results also show that respondents chose “to pay” later at a smaller amount than “to pay” immediately of the equivalent total value. The reallocation of resources saved to earmarked programs is more acceptable than the reallocation to non-earmarked programs. In particular, respondents opted for a more immediate compensation from the elimination or reduction of the subsidy.",,,,,Public economics; Exit strategy; Behavioral economics; Endowment effect; Status quo bias; Economics; Valuation (finance); Experimental economics; Commodity; Subsidy,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40045/1/MPRA_paper_40045.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2104997 http://core.ac.uk/display/12033176 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40045/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12033176.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2104997,,10.2139/ssrn.2104997,1675257918,,0,002-383-975-295-878; 002-767-093-889-714; 005-107-894-544-949; 010-307-139-240-199; 017-489-838-067-043; 018-184-644-441-091; 022-355-357-537-144; 023-323-051-017-701; 026-763-178-093-099; 027-821-784-030-02X; 028-100-796-321-760; 028-482-117-809-681; 033-503-033-878-71X; 037-279-607-973-129; 038-523-104-433-065; 038-804-995-114-092; 040-596-934-801-698; 041-659-281-349-623; 050-016-939-840-628; 053-433-470-569-266; 057-708-501-650-100; 059-177-051-703-465; 068-538-131-068-665; 072-494-331-322-114; 075-145-567-875-237; 078-124-937-782-473; 082-478-016-809-785; 090-816-968-876-853; 093-539-423-650-420; 095-051-386-724-315; 097-609-628-961-317; 099-585-208-740-461; 101-859-588-779-696; 106-877-914-796-741; 108-626-252-296-372; 113-278-954-446-219; 116-275-534-296-096; 120-546-493-195-69X; 126-156-499-602-473; 142-111-815-120-945; 154-138-819-397-090; 154-700-258-521-973; 154-922-169-620-359; 170-333-764-950-656; 171-164-551-946-030; 173-523-486-683-725; 180-193-083-905-316; 182-999-715-795-182; 192-078-021-601-677,3

Rolison; Joseph Kane; Francis A. O’Neill; Riccardo Scarpa; Frank Kee,"Abstract Background This study applies attribute nonattendance to medical decision making. We aimed to demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used in medical decision making to assess whether psychiatrists were influenced in their treatment recommendations by information on the genotype of a patient, despite knowing the patient's response to treatment as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A patient's genetic information may be used to predict their response to therapy; such information, however, becomes redundant, and should not influence decisions, once a clinician knows the patient's actual response to treatment. Methods Sixty-seven psychiatrists were presented with patients' pre- or post-treatment scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for two hypothetical treatments for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists were also informed whether the patient possessed a genotype linked to hyper-responsiveness to one of the treatments, and were asked to recommend one of these two treatments. Attribute nonattendance assessed whether the information on genotype influenced psychiatrists' treatment recommendations. Results Years of experience predicted whether psychiatrists were influenced by the genetic information. Psychiatrists with 1 year or less of experience had a 46% probability of considering genetic information, whereas psychiatrists with at least 15 years of experience had a lower probability (7%). Conclusions Psychiatrists and other clinicians should be cautious about allowing a patient's genetic information to carry unnecessary weight in their clinical decision making.",20,1,126,131,Psychiatry; Genotype; Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale; Medical decision making; Clinical decision making; Response to treatment; Response to therapy; Pharmacogenetics; Medicine; Schizophrenia,attribute nonattendance; discrete choice; medical decision making,"Adult; Antipsychotic Agents/therapeutic use; Attitude of Health Personnel; Biomarkers; Female; Genotype; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Pharmacogenetics; Practice Patterns, Physicians'/statistics & numerical data; Psychiatry/statistics & numerical data; Schizophrenia/drug therapy",Antipsychotic Agents; Biomarkers,,https://iris.univr.it/handle/11562/960217 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/101158665/ValueAccepted_manuscript_3_.pdf https://dro.dur.ac.uk/19778/ https://core.ac.uk/display/76969307 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301516337615 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28212953 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28212953 https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/the-influence-of-genotype-information-on-psychiatrists-treatment- http://repository.essex.ac.uk/17933/ https://www.rti.org/publication/influence-genotype-information-psychiatrists-treatment-recommendations https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74374894.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jval.2016.09.2395,28212953,10.1016/j.jval.2016.09.2395,2548454705,,0,002-018-005-613-905; 006-841-261-801-207; 008-492-447-718-292; 008-632-033-048-26X; 009-277-168-214-862; 010-701-884-049-955; 013-813-279-154-883; 014-278-479-684-023; 014-928-896-955-025; 017-361-437-323-146; 017-927-288-908-115; 019-733-899-604-476; 026-391-916-572-098; 030-523-079-499-28X; 030-970-085-192-983; 032-069-332-607-05X; 034-679-135-412-254; 035-061-927-263-746; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-956-011-279-822; 042-627-416-303-850; 044-020-457-188-766; 045-532-835-274-81X; 048-207-539-832-434; 055-082-277-668-255; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-547-682-120-644; 059-899-367-297-496; 061-166-402-956-930; 071-540-451-554-41X; 087-412-597-244-072; 087-975-335-811-056; 095-743-965-385-263; 098-376-587-660-420; 099-883-114-833-005; 109-272-635-110-150; 110-738-293-035-492; 118-929-991-648-723; 123-265-105-195-70X; 128-315-979-589-27X; 135-511-199-560-793; 142-875-989-754-243; 158-403-210-085-10X; 162-783-580-435-359; 166-178-474-455-903; 185-103-684-415-654,2

L. Harris; Laura de Molière; Melinda Soh; Ulrike Hahn,"One of the most accepted findings across psychology is that people are unrealistically optimistic in their judgments of comparative risk concerning future life events—they judge negative events as less likely to happen to themselves than to the average person. Harris and Hahn (2011), however, demonstrated how unbiased (non-optimistic) responses can result in data patterns commonly interpreted as indicative of optimism due to statistical artifacts. In the current paper, we report the results of 5 studies that control for these statistical confounds and observe no evidence for residual unrealistic optimism, even observing a ‘severity effect’ whereby severe outcomes were overestimated relative to neutral ones (Studies 3 & 4). We conclude that there is no evidence supporting an optimism interpretation of previous results using the prevalent comparison method.",12,3,e0173136,,Developmental psychology; Regression analysis; Cognition; Optimism; Young adult; MEDLINE; Data patterns; Normal people; Medicine; Analysis of variance,,Adolescent; Cognition; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Motivation; Optimism; Students/psychology; Young Adult,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28278200/ https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1551122/ https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173136 https://core.ac.uk/display/149586478 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5344342 http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/18926/ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0173136 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017PLoSO..1273136H/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/141227997.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0173136,28278200,10.1371/journal.pone.0173136,2592955798,PMC5344342,0,001-379-271-488-550; 002-597-966-013-414; 003-498-762-032-886; 003-772-594-918-248; 004-931-001-732-731; 004-949-838-366-871; 005-386-878-457-09X; 005-553-153-856-945; 005-762-601-105-119; 007-235-613-104-859; 007-553-765-239-553; 008-077-003-420-817; 011-087-418-438-848; 011-213-596-160-505; 011-634-281-853-003; 012-419-306-168-454; 014-035-685-925-91X; 014-250-530-986-293; 014-419-216-898-317; 019-200-757-553-43X; 019-995-576-553-416; 020-419-379-272-121; 022-810-581-767-78X; 026-387-449-478-155; 027-186-789-368-775; 029-058-747-897-018; 029-504-547-356-513; 031-672-019-523-79X; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-226-395-265-065; 036-017-634-035-123; 037-502-732-086-894; 037-864-515-237-922; 038-542-564-501-704; 038-796-562-786-232; 040-269-259-341-705; 041-633-508-813-502; 043-142-630-494-046; 044-003-372-741-839; 049-549-705-839-516; 050-235-436-459-972; 054-163-434-118-897; 055-209-565-108-549; 057-761-715-276-049; 059-943-435-322-573; 061-082-122-262-098; 063-225-190-754-113; 066-362-433-635-072; 067-604-805-850-781; 068-063-760-048-417; 074-358-010-155-235; 075-679-261-715-018; 084-421-364-199-245; 086-630-335-134-411; 087-345-957-536-902; 088-719-891-105-332; 090-926-023-865-757; 091-389-538-378-494; 092-101-055-296-807; 094-004-310-705-654; 095-594-667-412-730; 095-926-113-754-518; 098-950-277-295-601; 107-854-421-865-889; 114-590-207-496-477; 134-549-916-860-252; 136-955-095-033-255; 141-241-418-288-911; 148-223-435-969-407; 148-466-217-179-980; 156-695-224-836-175; 163-569-396-472-394; 166-148-082-833-226; 166-538-828-667-900; 174-354-840-315-426,3

Perniss; Robin L. Thompson; Gabriella Vigliocco,"Current views about language are dominated by the idea of arbitrary connections between linguistic form and meaning. However, if we look beyond the more familiar Indo-European languages and also include both spoken and signed language modalities, we find that motivated, iconic form-meaning mappings are, in fact, pervasive in language. In this paper, we review the different types of iconic mappings that characterize languages in both modalities, including the predominantly visually iconic mappings found in signed languages. Having shown that iconic mapping are present across languages, we then proceed to review evidence showing that language users (signers and speakers) exploit iconicity in language processing and language acquisition. While not discounting the presence and importance of arbitrariness in language, we put forward the idea that iconicity need also be recognized as a general property of language, which may serve the function of reducing the gap between linguistic form and conceptual representation to allow the language system to ""hook up"" to motor, perceptual, and affective experience.",1,,227,227,Language transfer; Comprehension approach; Language identification; Iconicity; Object language; Natural language; Computer science; Linguistics; Sign language; Universal Networking Language,iconicity; sound-symbolism; spoken and signed languages,,,,https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/86270 http://www.pernipa.eu/papers/Perniss_etal_2010_FrontPsych.pdf https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/86270/86270.pdf?sequence=1 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:1158593 https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_1158593 https://research.brighton.ac.uk/en/publications/iconicity-as-a-general-property-of-language-evidence-from-spoken- https://doaj.org/article/3275bb7e40ac45e1b643b1b35c5d6860 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00227/full http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1302046/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3153832/ https://europepmc.org/article/MED/21833282 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00227/pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00227/abstract https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F86270,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00227,21833282,10.3389/fpsyg.2010.00227,2160859782,PMC3153832,0,000-414-757-800-318; 001-087-908-770-330; 001-480-437-161-889; 001-931-699-557-381; 005-018-511-223-271; 005-194-642-983-425; 005-626-182-606-747; 007-830-589-244-128; 008-206-248-558-425; 009-713-147-407-25X; 010-237-707-608-596; 012-411-799-753-750; 012-670-372-793-565; 012-965-181-982-599; 017-993-603-029-23X; 021-540-102-442-870; 023-192-465-586-018; 023-610-805-000-597; 023-757-153-657-214; 024-844-587-229-075; 026-295-797-148-517; 026-604-681-798-020; 026-811-351-874-23X; 027-215-381-352-534; 027-379-048-216-345; 027-481-017-588-016; 028-967-510-785-925; 030-170-456-812-577; 031-105-803-293-114; 031-499-060-921-945; 031-674-287-545-53X; 032-642-951-347-284; 032-977-852-522-176; 034-637-677-318-080; 035-650-946-532-505; 037-585-614-275-877; 040-079-482-902-731; 040-138-044-081-344; 042-379-753-384-321; 042-752-319-184-872; 043-537-570-217-00X; 044-442-290-232-509; 045-689-196-744-373; 046-128-515-888-865; 047-123-202-771-205; 048-332-521-475-478; 049-121-399-837-231; 049-695-156-518-853; 054-083-714-078-439; 057-156-528-415-458; 058-296-730-243-662; 058-698-193-792-165; 060-010-994-975-74X; 063-314-453-719-323; 066-011-153-184-911; 066-830-013-854-687; 071-694-434-274-012; 075-252-043-644-642; 075-442-159-696-687; 078-499-259-439-633; 079-209-564-867-499; 083-841-142-137-975; 085-827-420-362-905; 086-698-428-066-762; 088-678-856-900-869; 089-633-353-717-023; 089-686-014-568-085; 093-886-420-858-679; 099-259-357-186-843; 100-667-314-955-16X; 101-699-605-475-660; 104-000-275-935-253; 105-755-133-200-018; 108-624-172-845-969; 108-768-640-850-148; 110-122-954-984-674; 111-021-318-377-033; 113-244-285-870-286; 113-567-480-146-783; 117-285-800-338-566; 118-814-814-948-055; 122-866-465-858-076; 124-794-660-911-007; 127-686-407-880-957; 132-405-300-831-650; 133-637-850-601-621; 135-301-316-346-206; 140-687-861-003-01X; 141-686-240-297-547; 143-332-269-730-652; 154-433-007-307-549; 159-532-492-016-811; 160-609-053-246-867; 163-763-458-895-157; 168-546-180-396-732; 170-132-402-159-452; 171-517-751-760-960; 172-520-117-169-456; 174-916-783-983-680; 177-913-694-661-538; 180-069-578-722-468; 180-943-965-695-461; 181-988-804-234-854; 186-488-120-817-427; 187-147-279-818-246; 188-899-863-240-437; 192-941-135-125-204; 194-782-603-396-660; 195-976-346-588-371,324

McManamey,"Abstract : The psychophysical Law of Comparative Judgment (LCJ) has been shown to have substantial value in assessing the signature of camouflaged or signature managed (C/SM) military assets when there is a need for a psychophysical measure of effectiveness. However, statistical tools for analyzing LCJ data are not widely available, have until now only had command- line interfaces, and require extensive interaction with the analyst. This prompted the Army to produce a new computer program that combines the functionality of several older command-line programs and has a more convenient windows interface. Exercising normal caution with new computer code, it is necessary to verify the new program to ensure that it correctly performs the desired tasks. This process requires a number of test cases: examples of each different class of results to be expected. Additionally, some of the changes in the program are expected to affect the precision of values for LCJ scales. Thus, since the values obtained with the new program are expected to be different than those obtained with the old one, it is necessary to verify that the results are equivalent. This paper describes the nature of the changes, the validation process, the nature of the validation data, and the results of the validation effort. The conclusion states that the new program does give results that are very similar to those obtained with the old programs.",,,,,Data mining; Test case; Psychophysics; Law of comparative judgment; Judgement; Computer program; Law enforcement; Statistical analysis; Computer science; Source code,,,,,,,,,48842467,,0,,0

The goal of this contribution is to develop a new technique that combines the Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment with an ad hoc response mode based on preference orderings. Apart from being relatively practical and user-friendly, this technique allows to express the collective judgment of objects on a ratio scale and is applicable to a variety of practical contexts in the field of manufacturing.

Slot; Evelyn H. Kroesbergen; Jaccoline E. van ’t Noordende; Paul P.M. Leseman,"The present study compared eye movements and performance of a nine-year-old girl with Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) on a series of number line tasks to those of a group of typically developing (TD) children (n = 10), in order to answer the question whether eye-tracking data from number line estimation tasks can be a useful tool to discriminate between TD children and children with a number processing deficit. Quantitative results indicated that the child with dyscalculia performed worse on all symbolic number line tasks compared to the control group, indicated by a low linear fit (R2) and a low accuracy measured by mean percent absolute error. In contrast to the control group, her magnitude representations seemed to be better represented by a logarithmic than a linear fit. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on the data of the child with dyscalculia revealed more unidentifiable fixation patterns in the processing of multi-digit numbers and more dysfunctional estimation strategy use in one third of the estimation trials as opposed to approximately 10% in the control group. In line with her dyscalculia diagnosis, these results confirm the difficulties with spatially representing and manipulating numerosities on a number line, resulting in inflexible and inadequate estimation or processing strategies. It can be concluded from this case study that eye-tracking data can be used to discern different number processing and estimation strategies in TD children and children with a number processing deficit. Hence, eye-tracking data in combination with number line estimation tasks might be a valuable and promising addition to current diagnostic measures.",4,679,679,679,Statistics; Eye movement; Artificial intelligence; Number sense; Dyscalculia; Developmental Dyscalculia; Logarithm; Computer science; Linear regression; Eye tracking; Number line,diagnostic procedures; dyscalculia; eye-tracking; mapping; number line; number sense,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/26619666 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679/abstract https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F286852 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/286852/1/fpsyg-04-00679.pdf https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/286852/fpsyg-04-00679.pdf;sequence=1 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3787405 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/286852 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/215946 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098294 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82882457.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679,24098294,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679,2139968699,PMC3787405,0,002-953-676-947-858; 003-626-441-665-213; 003-649-624-849-586; 004-030-636-268-081; 007-793-097-779-118; 007-859-644-103-125; 009-107-548-631-500; 010-294-410-265-319; 012-388-407-909-857; 015-456-782-384-125; 017-085-978-465-253; 019-562-955-392-946; 021-671-283-817-095; 021-901-356-850-672; 034-555-714-030-846; 037-404-408-305-152; 047-440-067-968-409; 048-238-179-561-256; 052-617-534-049-850; 065-794-300-944-51X; 069-062-026-178-120; 077-801-593-495-321; 078-936-746-314-363; 083-408-184-903-503; 083-735-110-745-424; 084-525-058-359-286; 085-710-808-170-767; 086-214-041-467-250; 089-957-068-429-39X; 096-075-148-761-076; 101-247-346-974-870; 108-396-581-453-18X; 109-356-419-856-140; 113-985-328-659-252; 115-198-196-801-586; 129-827-356-327-594; 143-234-910-364-952; 159-202-961-604-420,28

Bartholomew; Emily Yoshikawa Ruesch; Eva Hartell; Greg J. Strimel,"Adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) has proven to be a valid, reliable, and feasible method for assessing student performance in open-ended design scenarios. In addition to the use of ACJ for purely assessment and evaluation, research has demonstrated an opportunity to identify the design values of judges involved with the ACJ process. The potential for ACJ, as a tool for understanding cultural design values, and potentially facilitating international collaboration, is intriguing. Therefore, this study established three panels of judges, from countries around the world, to assess one body of student work using the ACJ method. The similarities, differences, and findings from these assessment results were analyzed, revealing distinct design values, preferences, and differences for each group of judges from the different locations.",30,2,321,347,Cultural diversity; Psychology; Educational technology; Cross-cultural; Cultural design; Design values; Cultural influence; Evaluation methods; Science education; Applied psychology,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1253962 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10798-019-09506-8 http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1294010,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-019-09506-8,,10.1007/s10798-019-09506-8,2920694152,,0,003-019-903-218-043; 006-719-044-652-648; 007-840-977-956-003; 011-948-343-384-639; 022-123-915-110-223; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-486-381-437-418; 023-528-263-747-617; 029-825-662-410-826; 033-498-766-332-569; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-955-214-111-561; 045-958-976-778-745; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-322-891-872-13X; 051-426-516-197-907; 051-662-747-300-427; 052-483-952-410-45X; 054-261-690-499-421; 055-247-734-603-784; 055-409-664-806-189; 055-653-768-754-728; 055-875-865-161-135; 056-590-585-617-545; 058-678-012-548-158; 059-305-317-781-318; 064-969-558-812-624; 067-314-813-362-440; 068-582-222-430-445; 068-635-181-493-71X; 070-422-046-134-928; 071-974-556-925-713; 072-264-238-576-634; 072-374-147-895-768; 072-849-297-804-522; 079-092-490-707-743; 080-893-480-467-569; 084-392-647-828-232; 106-926-818-724-017; 109-913-382-999-285; 111-149-136-071-554; 120-588-342-597-419; 123-212-204-814-685; 126-454-221-798-016; 126-875-389-752-711; 132-737-542-178-704; 148-141-963-796-23X; 149-208-961-050-864; 152-275-234-070-39X; 157-758-543-468-615; 163-379-589-157-078; 163-938-197-264-411; 168-704-895-296-891; 170-355-137-504-945; 170-621-479-140-749; 173-547-201-567-568; 177-879-513-292-176; 177-926-282-294-594; 178-742-205-322-766; 182-654-317-262-088,2

In this chapter, I seek answers to these questions in a perhaps unlikely place: the television series The Wire. Known for its unflinching realism, the crime drama narrates the intertwined lives of police, criminals, politicians, teachers and journalists in drug-plagued urban Baltimore. Yet even in the thick and quick of institutional dysfunction the drama portrays, human virtue springs forth and institutions (despite themselves) sometimes perform their roles. I begin this exploration of The Wire by drawing on Montesquieu and other political theorists to evaluate the problems facing state institutions – problems of diversity and principle as much as selfishness and power-mongering. I then turn to the prospects for virtue within modern institutions, developing and applying the system of Alasdair MacIntyre and paying particular attention to the role of narrative in cementing and integrating virtue.",11,,51,80,Political science; Narrative; Narrative ethics; Virtue; Social science; Professional ethics; Criminal justice ethics; Drama; Realism; Politics; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/10072/67256/1/98014_1.pdf https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1529-209620140000011003/full/html https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/67256 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143853239.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/s1529-209620140000011003,,10.1108/s1529-209620140000011003,1000539161,,0,021-360-635-546-316; 045-505-856-206-281; 056-493-325-541-666; 060-538-602-287-469; 061-362-576-015-725; 066-396-973-780-620; 067-879-999-500-239; 073-981-815-903-454; 086-341-268-012-025; 089-472-901-622-785; 089-882-560-206-370; 103-184-153-448-417; 125-568-022-593-703; 140-469-055-509-379; 144-179-787-087-757; 169-303-482-162-78X,2

Devinney; Byron Keating,"The service value proposition plays a key role in defining the most appropriate mix of components in service operations management. However, service companies often find it difficult to obtain a good understanding of how customers differentially value the service components that are offered by different providers. In this paper we identify the factors that are important to the choice of a logistics service provider. We use a stated choice experiment to explore the relative importance of seven service attributes based on a sample of 309 individuals across a range of industries and countries who have a role in purchasing logistics services. The results show that three distinct types of behavior populate our data and the preferences for price, delivery performance, service recovery, relationships, capacity, innovation and professional knowledge varies greatly between these customer groups. The practical importance of this insight is that we provide a logical starting point from which managers can begin to reverse engineer their service operations.",,,,,Service provider; Business; Service system; Service level objective; Marketing; Service level requirement; Service recovery; Service guarantee; Service design; Service delivery framework,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=1277184 https://ssrn.com/abstract=1277184 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1277184_code283089.pdf?abstractid=1277184&mirid=1&type=2 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12033440.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1277184,,10.2139/ssrn.1277184,2165000935,,0,007-168-167-425-611; 008-432-011-808-903; 011-049-321-684-279; 011-690-077-911-962; 012-277-806-980-851; 013-494-113-724-238; 014-072-104-936-34X; 016-328-723-513-716; 020-578-343-056-847; 020-601-584-097-239; 025-678-575-213-565; 025-927-180-807-187; 033-395-932-952-957; 034-075-238-775-480; 035-205-932-049-197; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-456-329-593-10X; 039-508-545-159-744; 042-541-009-622-734; 046-244-429-273-512; 047-045-788-030-824; 049-279-981-955-188; 050-412-574-453-290; 051-822-922-033-320; 052-319-259-195-574; 052-360-668-387-408; 054-480-369-813-816; 056-100-787-001-621; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-320-878-518-113; 059-837-511-300-730; 060-005-552-328-100; 061-257-602-028-104; 062-422-003-988-86X; 064-595-148-293-725; 064-895-287-655-997; 073-940-192-507-322; 075-018-831-496-091; 075-162-921-774-477; 075-463-477-505-623; 077-239-266-525-583; 077-605-677-039-632; 081-717-164-986-897; 083-162-020-504-664; 085-138-376-626-614; 092-838-045-035-693; 097-384-702-347-880; 099-842-582-947-408; 103-599-223-368-653; 106-150-680-960-467; 108-398-190-639-373; 109-639-867-416-78X; 125-506-719-203-986; 131-789-726-455-76X; 145-485-135-221-297; 149-121-878-072-411; 153-836-444-554-986; 155-877-343-478-922; 162-955-657-228-138; 175-515-458-081-383; 182-489-734-208-027; 192-331-090-916-695; 197-301-858-004-875,8

In this context, several studies have been proposed from both academia and industry trying to develop new measurements related to green supply chain management (GSCM) practices to overcome these barriers, which will help create new environmental strategies, implementing those practices in their manufacturing processes. The objective of this study is to present the technical and analytical contribution that multi-criteria decision making analysis (MCDA) can bring to environmental decision making problems, and especially to GSCM field. For this reason, a multi-criteria decision-making methodology, combining fuzzy analytical hierarchy process and fuzzy technique for order preference by similarity to ideal solution (fuzzy TOPSIS), is proposed to contribute to a better understanding of new sustainable strategies through the identification and evaluation of the most appropriate GSCM practices to be adopted by industrial organizations. The fuzzy AHP process is used to construct hierarchies of the influential criteria, and then identify the importance weights of the selected criteria, while the fuzzy TOPSIS process employs these weighted criteria as inputs to evaluate and measure the performance of each alternative. To illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our MCDA approach, we have applied it to a chemical industry corporation located in Safi, Morocco.",5,1,664,664,Decision support system; Supply chain; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Risk analysis (engineering); Multidisciplinary approach; Hierarchy; Computer science; Supply chain management; Management science; Fuzzy logic; Sustainability,Decision support system; FAHP; Fuzzy TOPSIS; Green supply chain management (GSCM) practices; Multi-criteria decision-making,,,,http://www.europepmc.org/articles/PMC4899393/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27350904/ https://core.ac.uk/display/81770321 https://paperity.org/p/76229397/multi-criteria-decision-support-framework-for-sustainable-implementation-of-effective https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-2233-2 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899393/ https://springerplus.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40064-016-2233-2 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2233-2 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40064-016-2233-2.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81770321.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2233-2,27350904,10.1186/s40064-016-2233-2,2403166153,PMC4899393,0,000-481-421-130-242; 001-864-931-533-855; 002-546-030-107-894; 003-196-136-668-226; 003-550-080-967-321; 005-119-112-479-686; 006-592-046-425-806; 011-061-667-703-512; 013-388-949-216-349; 018-289-671-158-41X; 020-367-649-345-772; 022-058-831-865-209; 022-402-008-266-648; 023-562-778-374-863; 023-654-030-797-362; 024-732-473-596-882; 024-858-174-318-00X; 027-759-789-986-587; 027-858-004-914-705; 028-117-828-495-601; 029-032-362-913-720; 032-511-999-364-606; 034-463-927-904-377; 034-919-097-348-166; 037-423-792-391-123; 039-832-430-396-867; 042-560-275-674-397; 042-680-700-728-736; 043-639-650-762-144; 046-505-785-832-627; 048-240-143-986-036; 052-438-467-510-294; 052-461-910-461-761; 053-911-201-033-723; 059-240-932-708-046; 060-063-910-053-174; 061-246-180-664-712; 062-086-928-998-824; 065-260-786-876-644; 065-771-385-740-257; 065-986-337-913-238; 066-142-507-823-363; 066-363-349-826-233; 067-341-125-020-782; 068-265-221-844-313; 068-317-785-206-415; 068-859-676-748-430; 069-019-319-397-50X; 071-955-404-931-475; 073-111-260-039-64X; 082-297-619-585-730; 085-583-937-301-162; 088-580-519-905-700; 090-073-143-920-958; 093-080-000-177-938; 101-771-818-525-450; 102-332-349-008-953; 110-044-477-975-837; 110-960-712-058-857; 112-224-595-172-024; 114-065-483-332-019; 114-070-132-931-438; 114-120-105-180-096; 116-483-653-566-622; 122-111-875-781-870; 131-161-724-039-419; 140-621-648-772-192; 140-667-670-590-524; 141-340-842-616-244; 145-647-081-098-64X; 147-869-941-422-339; 150-510-585-095-024; 156-536-382-034-719; 157-216-553-211-710; 157-585-392-891-770; 162-012-959-513-424; 164-287-371-458-79X; 173-137-502-164-357; 175-492-580-067-375; 184-193-845-416-582; 187-122-363-045-775,18

Dimitriadis; Yu Sun; Nitish V. Thakor; Anastasios Bezerianos,"Many neuroimaging studies have demonstrated the different functional contributions of spatially distinct brain areas to working memory (WM) subsystems in cognitive tasks that demand both local information processing and interregional coordination. In WM cognitive task paradigms employing electroencephalography (EEG), brain rhythms such as θ and α have been linked to specific functional roles over given brain areas, but their functional coupling has not been extensively studied. Here we analyzed an arithmetic task with five cognitive workload levels (CWLs) and demonstrated functional/effective coupling between the two WM subsystems: the central executive located over frontal (F) brain areas that oscillates on the dominant θ rhythm (Frontalθ/Fθ) and the storage buffer located over parieto-occipital (PO) brain areas that operates on the α2 dominant brain rhythm (Parieto-Occipitalα2/POα2). We focused on important differences between and within WM subsystems in relation to behavioral performance. A repertoire of brain connectivity estimators was employed to elucidate the distinct roles of amplitude, phase within and between frequencies, and the hierarchical role of functionally specialized brain areas related to the task. Specifically, for each CWL, we conducted a) a conventional signal power analysis within both frequency bands at Fθ and POα2, b) the intra- and inter-frequency phase interactions between Fθ and POα2, and c) their causal phase and amplitude relationship. We found no significant statistical difference of signal power or phase interactions between correct and wrong answers. Interestingly, the study of causal interactions between Fθ and POα2 revealed frontal brain region(s) as the leader, while the strength differentiated between correct and wrong responses in every CWL with absolute accuracy. Additionally, zero time-lag between bilateral Fθ and right POa2 could serve as an indicator of mental calculation failure. Overall, our study highlights the significant role of coordinated activity between Fθ and POα2 via their causal interactions and the timing for arithmetic performance.",10,,454,454,Elementary cognitive task; Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognition; Working memory; Brain connectivity estimators; Mental calculation; Electroencephalography; Neuroimaging; Information processing,cognition; cross-frequency coupling; hierarchical organization; mental arithmetic; working memory,,,,http://orca-mwe.cf.ac.uk/95978/ http://orca.cf.ac.uk/95978/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27683547 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00454/full https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/causal-interactions-between-frontalsup%CE%B8sup-parieto-occipitalsup%CE%B12 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27683547/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82873351.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00454,27683547,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00454,2519146080,PMC5022172,0,000-090-458-316-333; 000-517-960-832-317; 001-122-221-288-522; 001-244-924-745-924; 001-746-501-619-766; 002-007-829-504-169; 002-641-654-624-887; 002-708-549-796-998; 002-784-097-435-837; 003-240-212-088-393; 003-818-016-756-68X; 004-248-090-347-707; 004-766-465-240-165; 004-804-915-515-678; 004-931-588-752-466; 005-608-441-476-408; 005-977-120-023-41X; 005-998-696-393-635; 006-635-819-665-420; 006-727-278-800-703; 007-285-327-613-957; 007-515-433-614-743; 008-366-134-728-724; 008-405-328-367-874; 010-256-443-310-561; 011-086-556-756-356; 011-746-213-299-713; 012-516-196-470-621; 013-869-180-457-545; 014-175-100-464-076; 014-306-742-076-726; 014-675-936-416-85X; 015-659-268-202-819; 016-286-746-289-494; 016-562-280-868-045; 016-773-235-795-940; 017-028-466-927-708; 017-205-943-677-604; 017-220-260-414-288; 019-024-741-446-234; 019-198-395-259-670; 020-243-353-182-535; 020-542-114-256-808; 021-335-269-074-173; 021-904-530-539-008; 023-148-945-641-196; 023-217-255-419-789; 024-215-699-434-354; 025-026-993-471-619; 025-720-028-884-243; 026-082-958-841-699; 026-380-955-565-508; 026-494-896-806-353; 027-129-548-749-20X; 028-371-309-438-983; 028-693-632-683-913; 029-661-120-897-686; 030-267-399-959-601; 030-679-704-441-448; 031-461-293-336-268; 032-444-215-261-450; 033-161-239-763-072; 033-987-957-285-504; 038-406-658-229-135; 038-753-862-994-084; 039-591-464-033-242; 041-313-540-432-061; 042-027-187-250-871; 044-449-502-936-551; 047-408-805-586-577; 047-702-062-831-072; 049-596-999-737-575; 051-317-843-056-99X; 051-847-016-241-030; 054-001-514-709-265; 055-235-029-065-484; 055-804-328-017-818; 056-028-133-098-117; 056-616-861-431-230; 057-016-400-594-034; 059-424-379-092-456; 060-827-530-628-295; 062-871-374-134-322; 063-153-699-852-429; 063-170-613-227-185; 064-586-496-729-797; 068-650-622-321-338; 069-489-840-900-395; 069-548-364-501-728; 071-858-858-447-245; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-559-509-594-186; 073-877-011-445-136; 075-323-952-248-28X; 077-223-748-392-772; 078-512-647-895-968; 081-660-015-406-970; 082-146-278-760-351; 084-419-117-891-231; 092-966-218-962-53X; 093-468-101-878-849; 093-949-796-726-530; 094-889-729-050-459; 096-136-918-652-615; 097-559-976-556-438; 097-971-573-243-685; 098-903-353-538-029; 099-149-453-933-020; 100-984-129-853-216; 102-326-251-962-983; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-802-343-845-004; 110-348-282-605-660; 110-358-486-047-09X; 112-084-712-306-238; 116-102-340-293-860; 116-552-555-760-516; 122-781-159-648-035; 124-852-246-284-645; 130-814-599-896-858; 131-040-957-155-671; 132-670-354-889-185; 133-758-228-379-101; 136-669-000-047-324; 142-457-328-634-162; 157-788-875-922-252; 160-305-274-218-525; 162-374-831-047-16X; 166-235-005-948-412; 175-941-183-014-561; 195-841-626-389-256,18

We offer an argument for the requirement that an agent’s qualitative (comparative) judgments be probabilistically representable, inspired by, but importantly different from, the Money Pump argument for transitivity of preference and Dutch book arguments for quantitative coherence. The argument is supported by a theorem, to the effect that a subject is systematically susceptible to dominance given her preferred acts, if and only if the subject’s comparative judgments preclude representation by a standard probability measure (or set of such measures).",83,3,348,370,Epistemology; Axiom; Transitive relation; Probability measure; Dutch book; Comparative probability; Mathematics; If and only if; Probability axioms; Coherence (physics),,,,,https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685742 http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/685742,http://dx.doi.org/10.1086/685742,,10.1086/685742,2467909439,,0,005-432-062-446-413; 010-155-211-179-813; 019-634-842-943-748; 032-015-209-258-882; 036-343-034-116-679; 041-055-817-137-745; 045-510-251-280-506; 051-006-815-865-855; 063-309-462-350-103; 072-139-142-114-432; 081-533-984-386-014; 098-955-499-112-850; 117-127-350-531-751; 132-817-209-463-915; 138-352-679-740-789; 189-919-932-955-340; 196-393-219-430-629; 197-831-980-664-736,4

For the purpose of considering the multi-attributes in the decision making, We used two-step approach such as : in the first step, we used the multi-attribute analysis method using AHP(analytic hierarchy process) and in the second step we used fuzzy set ranking methodologies to integrate the special decision problems; those of multi-objective, multi-criterion, and multi-attributes. We proposed a procedure for the comparative judgement and priority for make-or-buy decision and also for the optimal resource allocation. First the rank-ordered priority lists of the projects are determined based on the AHP, then the aggregate fuzzy set rank order was computed. Finally, we developed a systematic and practical program for simple and easy calculation of all the algorithms. It was found that the model validated by comparative computations in various make-or-buy example problems in manufacturing system.",,,156,163,Data mining; Optimal decision; Evidential reasoning approach; Decision analysis cycle; Decision analysis; Weighted sum model; Mathematics; Rank reversals in decision-making; Operations research; Decision model; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE01943701,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE01943701,,,1913684885,,0,,0

Newman; Norbert Schwarz,"Abstract Claims are more likely to be judged true when presented with a related nonprobative photo (Newman et al., 2012). According to a processing fluency account, related photos facilitate processing and easy processing fosters acceptance of the claim. Alternatively, according to an illusion-of-evidence account, related photos may increase acceptance of the claim because they are treated as tentative supportive evidence. We disentangle these potential mechanisms by using comparative claims. In forming comparative judgments, people first assess attributes of the linguistic subject of comparison and subsequently compare them to attributes of the referent (Tversky, 1977). Hence, photos of the linguistic subject in a sentence should facilitate, but photos of the linguistic referent should impair, fluent processing of this sequence. In contrast, a photo of either the subject or the referent can be perceived as tentative evidence. In two experiments (total N = 1200), photos of the subject increased acceptance of comparative claims relative to a no-photo condition (a truthiness effect), but only when the subject was otherwise difficult to visualize. Photos of the referent decreased acceptance of comparative claims relative to a no-photo condition (a falsiness effect), but only when the subject of comparison was otherwise easy to visualize. All results are consistent with a context-sensitive fluency account: increases in fluency foster, and decreases in fluency impair, acceptance of a claim as true. The results provide no support for an illusion-of-evidence account.",92,,104054,,Psychology; Referent; Fluency; Sentence; Processing fluency; Social psychology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022103120303942,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2020.104054,,10.1016/j.jesp.2020.104054,3089380371,,0,002-221-734-567-105; 004-325-071-035-747; 005-521-831-294-077; 010-549-304-372-139; 010-701-925-180-491; 011-115-817-618-243; 012-841-071-082-464; 013-380-732-067-294; 014-064-851-269-851; 015-300-819-613-040; 016-426-522-092-686; 021-930-032-729-449; 022-940-056-786-160; 023-499-771-612-794; 024-227-211-762-089; 026-840-856-114-837; 032-049-177-406-929; 033-789-099-087-888; 047-366-800-969-509; 054-839-977-258-826; 065-461-483-604-327; 065-515-259-220-055; 072-379-118-606-86X; 088-215-847-433-17X; 089-989-447-467-130; 090-023-370-872-145; 090-695-515-714-706; 094-724-259-979-136; 097-223-843-316-36X; 098-578-934-179-785; 100-316-393-966-726; 100-457-903-857-810; 119-647-878-140-945; 122-778-268-515-402; 148-466-217-179-980; 158-154-324-424-355; 172-748-526-717-047; 183-550-943-911-487; 189-768-150-908-958,2

Consistent with the considerable research on “thin slice” judgments, the mean latency for greater than chance accuracy confidence was just 16 s (median = 10 s) for the ten one-part scenes on the IPT. There was also a clear and strong linear trend for increasing accuracy confidence across the first 25 s of the ten one-part scenes. For the five-two-part scenes, where comparative judgments were required (e.g., which statement is truthful, which is a lie?), no clear pattern of increasing accuracy confidence was found, with mean scores hovering near chance.

We conclude by arguing that the subjective and intersubjective dimensions of agency and ownership cannot be considered in isolation from one another, but instead form an interdependent pairing.",10,,459,459,Embodied cognition; Situated; Sense of agency; Attribution; Psychology; Agoraphobia; Argument; Anxiety; Schizophrenia; Social psychology,agoraphobia; attribution of ownership; schizophrenia; sense of agency; sense of ownership,,,Alexander von Humboldt-Stiftung,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459/full http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459 https://core.ac.uk/display/81226726 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459/abstract https://ro.uow.edu.au/lhapapers/2633/ http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3643&context=lhapapers https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27725796 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27725796 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82890507.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459,27725796,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00459,2523599755,PMC5035729,0,000-581-393-174-931; 001-634-466-472-968; 001-646-876-645-84X; 003-846-484-998-936; 004-768-487-522-357; 005-256-246-003-107; 007-084-504-300-011; 009-654-357-030-887; 010-005-144-072-86X; 012-704-958-899-79X; 014-214-656-496-849; 014-337-702-568-269; 015-931-048-653-757; 017-167-266-080-266; 017-292-493-178-266; 018-729-768-243-019; 019-153-905-872-274; 020-246-337-291-487; 020-428-629-974-754; 022-813-727-860-914; 024-172-517-191-455; 026-139-993-840-987; 026-777-546-119-131; 027-781-726-723-30X; 027-960-758-933-09X; 034-261-596-746-320; 035-985-134-650-72X; 036-025-953-040-763; 036-638-296-334-156; 037-000-650-976-957; 040-285-691-794-455; 040-597-808-544-840; 040-943-700-536-207; 042-484-997-987-211; 042-870-931-565-804; 044-541-929-610-237; 045-280-175-824-899; 046-323-288-735-546; 047-184-325-932-506; 049-026-737-392-453; 050-818-055-007-280; 051-648-281-983-359; 053-435-943-780-694; 055-849-703-261-839; 060-189-179-920-956; 061-042-636-185-644; 061-775-194-135-970; 062-389-902-250-672; 062-789-990-458-096; 064-673-796-372-262; 064-955-273-313-429; 074-512-271-012-817; 076-328-021-143-841; 077-736-396-213-729; 078-166-300-969-703; 078-256-673-279-982; 083-731-606-540-07X; 088-388-398-039-227; 090-047-577-947-649; 092-888-884-585-464; 094-052-149-069-511; 100-122-606-577-551; 104-239-962-823-581; 106-554-140-971-924; 108-832-261-789-395; 110-560-896-648-057; 115-025-221-606-200; 118-936-919-984-939; 128-241-894-649-510; 130-188-447-779-884; 136-602-352-755-950; 140-636-984-737-806; 153-684-427-703-687; 167-675-567-480-888; 191-423-020-825-36X,11

The performance of each observer was described by Thurstone’s discriminative processes and Bernoulli trial models which described empirical psychometric functions equally well. Although formally it was impossible to discriminate between these two models, treating observer as a counting device which measures a randomly selected subsample of all available motion elements had certain advantages. According to the Bernoulli trial model decisions about the global motion direction in a range of 12–800 elements were based on taking into account about 4 ± 2 random moving dot elements. This small number is not due to cancellation of the opposite motion vectors since the motion direction recognition performance did not improve after the compared motion directions were made orthogonal. This may indicate that the motion pooling mechanism studied in our experiment is strongly limited in capacity.",51,17,1949,1957,Motion estimation; Motion field; Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Perception; Computer vision; Computer science; Bernoulli trial; Pooling; Observer (quantum physics); Discriminative model,,"Adult; Discrimination, Psychological; Female; Humans; Male; Motion Perception/physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychometrics; Young Adult",,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82579123 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698911002410 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21777600 http://psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Raidvee-Averin-Kreegipuu-Allik_VR2011.pdf http://sys130.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Raidvee-Averin-Kreegipuu-Allik_VR2011.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82579123.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2011.07.004,21777600,10.1016/j.visres.2011.07.004,2006375248,,0,000-266-739-450-842; 004-297-191-539-32X; 004-449-360-245-032; 009-159-276-843-909; 012-609-943-800-755; 014-821-746-260-201; 015-070-039-909-659; 016-742-417-043-764; 020-235-174-598-690; 022-899-196-290-536; 025-009-913-016-196; 027-272-611-811-582; 028-535-835-828-816; 030-653-466-539-363; 031-521-631-886-53X; 032-067-909-007-114; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-143-726-588-796; 038-275-545-555-199; 038-431-856-067-629; 039-258-478-151-873; 047-405-091-891-479; 047-677-381-293-468; 047-991-400-147-462; 052-847-285-327-082; 053-968-735-982-189; 054-526-402-379-742; 055-758-430-499-580; 057-534-952-228-024; 059-694-000-234-57X; 061-320-622-100-205; 063-350-353-646-858; 063-737-844-245-932; 065-241-195-489-446; 065-346-416-569-521; 065-359-745-286-154; 068-794-306-041-281; 070-635-577-178-531; 074-618-414-831-998; 076-982-425-116-766; 078-852-269-868-532; 082-083-748-173-982; 086-308-650-669-808; 088-657-792-602-455; 096-507-969-290-685; 099-051-264-713-250; 100-632-424-345-952; 101-764-688-352-997; 105-392-061-303-834; 130-130-470-274-719; 136-849-533-910-15X; 149-078-829-241-249; 152-451-879-214-581; 153-124-832-996-852; 169-116-288-544-086,8

Allman; Kevin A. Pelphrey; Warren H. Meck,"Estimations of time and number share many similarities in both non-humans and man. The primary focus of this review is on the development of time and number sense across infancy and childhood, and neuropsychological findings as they relate to time and number discrimination in infants and adults. Discussion of these findings is couched within a mode-control model of timing and counting which assumes time and number share a common magnitude representation system. A basic sense of time and number likely serves as the foundation for advanced numerical and temporal competence, and aspects of higher cognition—this will be discussed as it relates to typical childhood, and certain developmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder. Directions for future research in the developmental neuroscience of time and number (NEUTIN) will also be highlighted.",6,,7,7,Competence (human resources); Developmental psychology; Neuropsychology;

Zimerman; Vicente Amato Neto; Antônio V Moraes; Guilherme Fenelon,"Background: There are no available statistical data about sudden cardiac death in Brazil. Therefore, this study has been conducted to evaluate the incidence of sudden cardiac death in our population and its implications.; ; ; ; Methods: The research methodology was based on Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment, whose premise is that the more an A stimulus differs from a B stimulus, the greater will be the number of people who will perceive this difference. This technique allows an estimation of actual occurrences from subjective perceptions, when compared to official statistics. Data were collected through telephone interviews conducted with Primary and Secondary Care physicians of the Public Health Service in the Metropolitan Area of Sao Paulo (MASP).; ; ; ; Results: In the period from October 19, 2009, to October 28, 2009, 196 interviews were conducted. The incidence of 21,270 cases of sudden cardiac death per year was estimated by linear regression analysis of the physicians’ responses and data from the Mortality Information System of the Brazilian Ministry of Health, with the following correlation and determination coefficients: r = 0.98 and r2= 0.95 (95% confidence interval 0.8–1.0, P < 0.05). The lack of waiting list for specialized care and socioadministrative problems were considered the main barriers to tertiary care access.; ; ; ; Conclusions: The incidence of sudden cardiac death in the MASP is high, and it was estimated as being higher than all other causes of deaths; the extrapolation technique based on the physicians’ perceptions was validated; and the most important bureaucratic barriers to patient referral to tertiary care have been identified.

In this study, we focus on grouping items with similar abilities and consider a new supervised clustering method by fusing specific parameters used in the Luce model. By modifying the penalty function conventionally used in grouping parameters, we obtain a new method of grouping items in the Luce model without pairwise comparison modeling and develop an efficient algorithm to estimate the parameters. Moreover, we give an application of the proposed algorithm to the Bradley-Terry model with ties. In the real data analysis, we confirm that the proposed estimator provides an easier interpretation of ranks and an improvement in the quality of prediction.",48,8,1953,1964,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Ranking; Efficient algorithm; Supervised clustering; Computer science; Penalty method,,,,Kyonggi University,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10489-016-0861-4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/apin/apin48.html#JeonC18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10489-016-0861-4,,10.1007/s10489-016-0861-4,2546960171,,0,001-821-022-385-875; 003-868-023-351-977; 005-932-334-805-223; 010-916-070-573-553; 014-222-619-452-919; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-980-379-566-99X; 032-437-388-057-540; 034-814-442-011-302; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-652-946-912-485; 046-645-764-444-881; 049-173-702-567-663; 050-943-988-713-681; 056-056-498-989-48X; 057-033-514-557-498; 057-657-809-679-383; 063-959-693-635-653; 068-885-458-943-499; 079-600-158-146-065; 081-370-959-105-221; 083-411-957-107-646; 087-351-485-660-85X; 087-991-691-200-809; 091-299-050-457-00X; 092-765-877-448-293; 098-895-722-161-291; 108-927-329-894-231; 124-626-119-412-629; 124-850-148-955-311; 153-906-359-466-085; 156-765-044-924-988; 160-813-032-767-792,0

Through their visions of a fictional future, the two narratives explore the hazards created by contemporary techno-economic progress, predatory global politics and capitalist excesses of consumption.

025-703-813-430-701,The locus and nature of semantic congruity in symbolic comparison: Evidence from the Stroop effect,,2002,journal article,Memory & cognition,0090502x; 15325946,Springer New York,United States,Samuel Shaki; Daniel Algom,"Pictures of animals with names of animals printed within the pictures were presented for comparative judgments of size based on either the pictures or the names. The picture-word compounds were compared faster with picture than with word as the relevant dimension. The comparisons of pictures were free of interference from the irrelevant names, but the comparisons of names suffered considerable Stroop interference from the irrelevant pictures. Large effects of semantic congruity characterized the comparisons of both pictures and words. Stroop congruity and semantic congruity did not interact even for comparison of words in which both were present, leading instead to additive effects. The results support theories that (1) place semantic congruity in the decision stage and (2) minimize the role of semantic processing as the basis of the semantic congruity effect.",30,1,3,17,Semantics; Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Semantic memory; Stimulus Similarity; Cognitive Discrimination; Pictorial stimuli; Linguistics,,"Adult; Attention; Discrimination Learning; Female; Humans; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Problem Solving; Reaction Time; Reading; Semantics; Size Perception; Symbolism",,,https://paperity.org/p/17377620/the-locus-and-nature-of-semantic-congruity-in-symbolic-comparison-evidence-from-the https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11958352 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03195260 http://freud.tau.ac.il/~algomd/Shaki%20&%20Algom%20%282002%29.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-12941-001,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03195260,11958352,10.3758/bf03195260,2102720256,,0,000-554-668-882-790; 003-375-024-877-035; 005-702-834-185-098; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 008-192-712-366-191; 009-351-777-389-759; 013-621-028-229-557; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-000-197-860-064; 019-125-244-295-044; 019-474-860-312-210; 034-751-723-948-497; 035-456-469-444-748; 040-055-439-900-718; 042-852-220-542-295; 044-825-864-388-659; 045-653-278-893-378; 049-863-149-640-914; 053-111-182-720-791; 055-175-889-753-779; 058-027-946-447-925; 060-290-302-293-721; 066-248-843-561-177; 067-715-519-706-692; 071-274-642-268-839; 073-186-108-785-791; 078-962-424-023-247; 083-665-507-689-714; 084-694-854-298-397; 084-837-414-058-221; 085-756-973-622-409; 090-473-073-536-194; 092-668-306-282-475; 092-687-930-296-014; 099-263-785-143-219; 103-115-912-331-916; 105-013-237-049-284; 109-926-662-069-886; 111-441-229-433-583; 113-095-154-061-52X; 124-257-870-583-335; 127-606-554-463-309; 129-032-914-840-116; 131-863-163-235-044; 140-852-236-865-139; 150-005-610-563-452; 153-263-507-223-004; 166-688-877-483-052; 175-397-495-157-485; 176-017-510-665-867; 180-920-485-417-145; 196-022-041-043-935,20

The ability of students to confront open-ended problem scenarios, think creatively, and produce novel designs have all been lauded as necessary skills for today’s twenty first century learners (Partnership for 21st Century Skills in P21 framework definitions, Author, Washington, 2016). This emphasis on open-ended design problems in problem-based learning scenarios has been tied to workforce and higher education preparation for students (National Academy of Engineering and National Research Council in STEM integration in K–12 education: status, prospects, and an agenda for research, National Academies Press, Washington, 2014; National Research Council in Engineering in K–12 education: understanding the status and improving the prospects, National Academies Press, Washington, 2009; Strimel in Technol Eng Teach 73(5):16–24, 2014b). However, little research has been conducted to identify the impact of potentially-influential factors on student success in such open-ended design scenarios. Therefore, the researchers examined data from 706 middle school students, working in small groups, as they completed an open-ended design challenge to determine the relationships between a variety of potentially-influential factors and student performance, as measured through adaptive comparative judgment. The analysis of the data revealed several relationships, significant and not significant, between identified variables and student success on open-ended design challenges.",28,3,753,770,Higher education; Sociology; Mathematics education; Educational technology; 21st century skills; Problem-based learning; Academic achievement; Science education; Technology education; Teaching method,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10798-017-9415-2 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1188771,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-017-9415-2,,10.1007/s10798-017-9415-2,2626923506,,0,001-501-293-778-301; 003-019-903-218-043; 006-744-827-885-039; 007-281-730-010-664; 007-772-789-516-199; 009-544-868-775-541; 010-534-021-567-946; 011-948-343-384-639; 012-038-926-898-942; 014-251-343-144-685; 016-210-005-968-27X; 019-826-135-539-400; 027-264-956-050-934; 027-960-410-324-971; 033-498-766-332-569; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-955-214-111-561; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-426-516-197-907; 051-814-221-704-953; 055-409-664-806-189; 055-574-238-286-730; 059-266-329-197-013; 066-383-747-992-446; 066-690-797-895-644; 066-908-670-161-319; 066-944-254-686-851; 068-124-584-046-362; 072-849-297-804-522; 075-488-109-463-15X; 084-387-473-195-669; 089-553-990-161-902; 102-623-771-206-912; 106-827-863-561-831; 109-913-382-999-285; 114-595-988-349-56X; 114-939-854-704-569; 115-525-906-517-498; 119-639-555-280-214; 126-875-389-752-711; 128-535-119-114-439; 132-737-542-178-704; 135-512-010-685-707; 140-741-091-406-49X; 148-141-963-796-23X; 149-511-969-579-297; 152-275-234-070-39X; 163-379-589-157-078; 164-308-344-451-138; 180-669-352-164-087; 182-654-317-262-088; 199-529-961-032-798,4

The present review summarizes and discusses evidence for language influences on the acquisition of the highly transparent structuring principles of digital-Arabic digits by means of its moderation through the transparency of the respective language’s number word system. In particular, the so-called inversion property (i.e., 24 named as ‘four and twenty’ instead of ‘twenty four’) was found to influence number processing in children not only in verbal but also in non-verbal numerical tasks. Additionally, there is first evidence suggesting that inversion-related difficulties may influence numerical processing longitudinally. Generally, language-specific influences in children’s numerical development are most pronounced for multi-digit numbers. Yet, there is currently only one study on three-digit number processing for German-speaking children. A direct comparison of additional new data from Italian-speaking children further corroborates the Whorfian claim that language impacts on all types of cognitive (number) processing as inversion-related interference was found most pronounced for German-speaking children. In sum, we conclude that numerical development may not be language-specific but seems to be moderated by language.",4,,480,480,Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Natural language processing; Structuring; Digit number; Computer science; Transparency (graphic); Inversion (meteorology); Arabic numerals; Moderation,inversion effects; language-moderated effects; multi-digit number comparison; number processing; numerical development,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/25875644 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/pdf https://www.psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/497 https://core.ac.uk/display/25875644 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/41889 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23935585 https://www.psycharchives.org/bitstream/20.500.12034/497/1/1_fpsyg-04-00480.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3733006/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82881500.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480,23935585,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480,2071849949,PMC3733006,0,001-748-233-366-772; 006-969-591-574-820; 011-100-905-938-026; 018-314-977-284-103; 019-935-740-500-195; 025-402-033-432-459; 027-797-536-732-199; 028-950-609-255-958; 033-846-649-025-947; 035-452-245-818-650; 050-226-266-734-956; 051-686-139-649-760; 052-282-457-923-273; 055-735-581-155-767; 056-584-935-475-778; 064-745-429-405-288; 066-304-520-554-064; 066-943-557-532-951; 067-185-839-037-47X; 075-801-056-667-527; 076-198-381-713-008; 083-351-004-762-543; 083-408-184-903-503; 084-525-058-359-286; 086-908-853-487-093; 089-318-935-543-107; 116-975-634-585-183; 128-887-777-838-374; 133-092-718-573-072; 140-400-662-583-719; 148-696-185-975-512; 157-943-855-831-393; 170-052-077-415-28X,25

This metric that fits the psycho-visual data obtained by an experiment analyzes the perceived distortions produced by demosaicing algorithms. The demosaicing operation consists of a combination of color interpolation (CI) and anti-aliasing (AA) algorithms and converts a raw image acquired with a single sensor array, overlaid with a color filter array, into a full-color image. The most prominent artifact generated by demosaicing algorithms is called zipper. The zipper artifact is characterized by segments (zips) with an On–Off pattern. We perform psycho-visual experiments on a dataset of images that covers nine different degrees of distortions, obtained using three CI algorithms combined with two AA algorithms. We then propose our no-reference metric based on measures of blurriness, chromatic and achromatic distortions to fit the psycho-visual data. With this metric demosaicing algorithms could be evaluated and compared.",2012,1,123,,Zipper; Achromatic lens; Artificial intelligence; Color filter array; Chromatic scale; Demosaicing; No reference; Computer vision; Mathematics; Image quality; Sensor array,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81611330 http://www.asp.eurasipjournals.com/content/2012/1/123 https://boa.unimib.it/handle/10281/41839 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://paperity.org/p/4186377/a-no-reference-metric-for-demosaicing-artifacts-that-fits-psycho-visual-experiments https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ejasp/ejasp2012.html#GaspariniMSG12 https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EJASP2012..123G/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81611330.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123,,10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123,2103582296,,0,000-737-046-616-756; 004-965-530-533-346; 005-540-618-248-657; 007-013-754-270-777; 012-399-040-381-403; 017-292-361-222-51X; 020-238-704-091-197; 021-767-144-368-900; 023-520-642-563-715; 034-432-871-717-465; 034-714-588-288-533; 034-942-857-698-480; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-013-153-822-566; 046-830-941-464-010; 052-092-245-209-652; 056-411-353-738-94X; 062-221-140-574-750; 064-271-659-902-376; 064-941-440-539-584; 089-268-782-898-325; 090-919-377-086-982; 102-534-640-692-020; 106-371-503-655-997; 109-124-136-340-862; 109-903-837-162-782; 118-137-478-537-701; 148-278-836-260-544; 148-597-206-982-890; 173-018-515-976-299; 188-736-996-129-955,3

Richard; Tim Coltman; Byron Keating,"Information technology-based innovation involves considerable risk requiring foresight; yet our understanding of the way in which managers develop the insight to support new breakthrough applications is limited and remains obscured by high levels of technical and market uncertainty. This paper applies discrete choice analysis to support improved empirical explanation of how and why decisions are made in information systems (IS). A new experimental method based on information acceleration (IA) is also applied to improve prediction of future IS service strategies. Both explanation and prediction are important to IS research and these two behaviourally sound methods complement each other. Specifically, the combination of IA and discrete choice analysis removes misspecification artefacts from response variability and generates more accurate parameter estimates that better explain IS decision making.",21,1,87,98,Risk analysis (engineering); Information technology; Information management; Accounting information system; Information system; Discrete choice; Management information systems; Computer science; Operations research; Strategic information system; Information science,,,,,https://orsociety.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/ejis.2010.62 https://doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2010.62 https://ro.uow.edu.au/commpapers/764/ https://works.bepress.com/bkeating/17/download/ https://eprints.qut.edu.au/131173/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1057/ejis.2010.62 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40488/1/MPRA_paper_40488.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/30345342 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40488/ http://ro.uow.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1812&context=commpapers https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ejis.2010.62 https://qa-eprints.qut.edu.au/131173/ https://works.bepress.com/bkeating/17/ http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40488/1/MPRA_paper_40488.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057/ejis.2010.62/fulltext.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ejis/ejis21.html#RichardCK12 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12033426.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/ejis.2010.62,,10.1057/ejis.2010.62,2102518620,,0,000-749-390-969-022; 000-974-850-592-846; 001-362-199-882-05X; 002-043-095-215-242; 004-955-765-542-299; 005-252-808-975-015; 005-553-153-856-945; 006-158-155-203-573; 007-662-196-679-446; 009-507-583-981-517; 011-035-742-767-307; 012-277-806-980-851; 012-743-153-762-931; 012-852-248-755-016; 012-924-073-251-050; 013-031-207-127-134; 013-349-720-454-697; 014-488-442-015-040; 015-120-646-138-190; 016-148-867-808-566; 017-732-979-943-710; 019-389-216-620-099; 020-192-497-521-308; 023-596-726-094-937; 023-869-533-897-152; 024-683-165-045-722; 025-324-380-630-299; 028-114-915-391-700; 028-464-538-669-454; 029-675-465-523-564; 032-045-372-512-331; 032-450-075-415-729; 033-299-951-118-001; 033-672-498-572-216; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-016-621-028-666; 039-180-398-452-230; 039-612-172-626-951; 041-012-439-921-531; 041-239-582-896-662; 041-659-281-349-623; 044-954-083-301-320; 045-908-779-278-359; 046-264-708-179-949; 048-413-313-313-364; 050-374-256-752-848; 052-251-055-553-853; 055-844-122-044-622; 056-914-260-684-430; 059-103-961-263-33X; 061-915-326-302-569; 062-168-246-442-166; 062-783-280-287-096; 063-123-327-601-576; 063-932-179-148-254; 064-333-577-704-465; 064-365-669-054-275; 065-409-107-548-650; 067-043-648-074-16X; 070-331-031-103-877; 070-583-318-701-592; 071-895-074-502-501; 072-414-924-640-158; 073-058-605-500-754; 073-802-035-737-858; 076-581-548-951-019; 076-622-774-507-926; 078-524-455-235-680; 081-773-639-506-815; 082-055-780-970-414; 082-096-390-520-54X; 084-799-292-394-467; 085-138-376-626-614; 085-331-468-438-658; 085-769-978-766-017; 089-621-912-811-772; 090-629-815-425-687; 090-990-327-643-383; 091-917-222-986-705; 095-787-407-375-612; 098-803-966-766-472; 099-388-772-643-694; 099-632-707-150-545; 100-092-259-619-002; 100-416-728-670-31X; 100-440-892-234-712; 102-325-899-749-961; 102-451-596-345-684; 103-705-771-764-928; 107-781-135-837-372; 107-925-302-806-160; 111-661-573-347-021; 113-439-333-982-005; 113-470-905-532-209; 114-685-371-109-418; 115-081-336-671-463; 119-113-819-818-430; 122-431-766-485-645; 123-561-176-815-458; 124-533-351-959-896; 126-080-908-715-391; 129-530-880-157-627; 130-683-780-976-046; 131-005-597-897-618; 133-615-216-407-672; 137-077-810-781-819; 141-220-172-440-756; 153-700-964-071-221; 159-307-114-014-834; 160-564-764-251-973; 161-032-541-111-315; 164-509-199-251-893; 164-655-908-758-60X; 165-194-337-288-970; 179-608-372-698-452; 189-112-301-545-620; 190-338-171-857-972; 194-347-223-769-721,18

Parker,"Cet article examine la facon dont sont representees les poetes femmes dans une anthologie de poesie majeure de l’epoque edouardienne, Poets of the Younger Generation, publiee par John Lane en 1902. Dans Poets, Archer cherche a canoniser trente-trois poetes de la fin du dix-neuvieme siecle, dont neuf poetes femmes (Katharine Tynan Hinkson, Nora Hopper, Alice Meynell et Rosamund Marriott Watson, pour ne citer que celles-ci). Les entrees de l’anthologie d’Archer sont accompagnees d’illustrations en gravure sur bois de Robert Bryden, fondees sur des portraits photographiques des poetes. Cet essai situe ces gravures dans le contexte des personnalites de la fin de l’epoque victorienne, du renouveau esthetique que representent la gravure sur bois et l’illustration gravee sur bois, et de la presence de plus en plus marquee du portrait d’auteur a l’epoque de la reproduction mecanique. Mon essai analyse ainsi l’interaction complexe entre le vocabulaire critique qu’utilise Archer et les images de Bryden. A mesure que le commentaire critique d’Archer elabore un vocabulaire reconduisant des jugements de valeur et des categories hierarchiques, vocabulaire nourri par des prejuges concernant l’identite nationale ou generique, les images de Bryden renforcent ce phenomene en enfermant les poetes femmes dans le cadre decoratif de l’appellation « poetesses ».",,84 Automne,,,Art; Humanities; Framing (social sciences); Art history,,,,,https://journals.openedition.org/cve/3011 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/21868 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Framing_the_woman_poet_William_Archer_s_poets_of_the_younger_generation_1902_/9331583 https://core.ac.uk/display/42486180 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42486180.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.4000/cve.3011,,10.4000/cve.3011,2472934959,,0,,0

Scott Whitmore; Alex H. Wagner; Adam P. DeLuca; Arlene V. Drack; Edwin M. Stone; Budd A. Tucker; Shemin Zeng; Terry A. Braun; Robert F. Mullins; Todd E. Scheetz,"Proper spatial differentiation of retinal cell types is necessary for normal human vision. Many retinal diseases, such as Best disease and male germ cell associated kinase (MAK)-associated retinitis pigmentosa, preferentially affect distinct topographic regions of the retina. While much is known about the distribution of cell types in the retina, the distribution of molecular components across the posterior pole of the eye has not been well-studied. To investigate regional difference in molecular composition of ocular tissues, we assessed differential gene expression across the temporal, macular, and nasal retina and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)/choroid of human eyes using RNA-Seq. RNA from temporal, macular, and nasal retina and RPE/choroid from four human donor eyes was extracted, poly-A selected, fragmented, and sequenced as 100 bp read pairs. Digital read files were mapped to the human genome and analyzed for differential expression using the Tuxedo software suite. Retina and RPE/choroid samples were clearly distinguishable at the transcriptome level. Numerous transcription factors were differentially expressed between regions of the retina and RPE/choroid. Photoreceptor-specific genes were enriched in the peripheral samples, while ganglion cell and amacrine cell genes were enriched in the macula. Within the RPE/choroid, RPE-specific genes were upregulated at the periphery while endothelium associated genes were upregulated in the macula. Consistent with previous studies, BEST1 expression was lower in macular than extramacular regions. The MAK gene was expressed at lower levels in macula than in extramacular regions, but did not exhibit a significant difference between nasal and temporal retina. The regional molecular distinction is greatest between macula and periphery and decreases between different peripheral regions within a tissue. Datasets such as these can be used to prioritize candidate genes for possible involvement in retinal diseases with regional phenotypes.",129,,93,106,Anatomy; Macular degeneration; Choroid; Retina; Retinal pigment epithelium; Amacrine cell; Retinitis pigmentosa; Macula Lutea; Posterior pole; Biology; Cell biology,Choroid; Gene expression; Macular degeneration; RNA-Seq; RPE; Retina; Retinitis pigmentosa; Transcriptome,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choroid; Female; Gene Expression Profiling; Humans; Macula Lutea/metabolism; Male; Pigment Epithelium of Eye/metabolism; RNA, Messenger/genetics; Retinal Diseases/genetics","RNA, Messenger",NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016822) United States; NIH HHS (DP2 OD007483) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY023187) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY016822) United States; Howard Hughes Medical Institute United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY024605) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY024605) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM008629) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY023187) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014483514002978 https://core.ac.uk/display/81973915 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4259842/ https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25446321 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25446321 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0014483514002978 https://profiles.wustl.edu/en/publications/transcriptomic-analysis-across-nasal-temporal-and-macular-regions https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81973915.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.exer.2014.11.001,25446321,10.1016/j.exer.2014.11.001,2010837054,PMC4259842,0,001-232-154-559-042; 003-564-603-156-761; 004-031-577-321-456; 007-250-347-112-05X; 007-751-389-759-922; 012-161-412-902-477; 013-062-295-189-934; 013-438-701-306-343; 016-126-420-713-66X; 016-937-957-633-618; 017-584-791-339-94X; 025-035-300-942-68X; 027-554-117-232-230; 032-750-926-009-177; 033-378-322-108-826; 034-381-033-214-335; 037-243-737-232-754; 047-878-620-442-549; 048-136-752-118-541; 051-345-532-034-53X; 056-531-202-220-488; 057-852-527-598-140; 063-531-104-359-914; 064-955-175-071-526; 069-851-282-938-856; 071-400-109-953-461; 073-126-723-032-877; 085-309-020-554-932; 085-981-447-638-903; 096-437-622-644-789; 100-830-710-727-908; 102-928-051-122-435; 105-996-818-904-410; 121-751-049-465-322; 127-855-697-172-194,74

Six experiments show that anthropomorphism increases consumers’ use of an absolute judgment strategy (vs. a dimension-by-dimension strategy) in comparative judgment, leading to increased preference for the option with a more favorable overall evaluation over the option with a greater number of superior dimensions. The effect is mediated by consumers’ perception of each anthropomorphized product alternative as an integrated entity rather than a bundle of separate attributes. The authors find the effect to be robust by directly tracing the process of participants’ information processing using MouseLab software and eye-tracking techniques, and by self-reported preferences and real consumption choices. Moreover, the effect is moderated by the motivation to seek maximized accuracy or ease. These studies have important implications for theories about anthropomorphism and comparative judgment as well as marketing practice.",46,5,936,955,Tracing; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Software; Bundle; Consideration set; Computer science; Information processing,,,,Hong Kong SAR Research; China NSFC,http://hub.hku.hk/handle/10722/281198 https://research.polyu.edu.hk/en/publications/the-influence-of-product-anthropomorphism-on-comparative-judgment https://academic.oup.com/jcr/article/46/5/936/5532511,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jcr/ucz028,,10.1093/jcr/ucz028,2958870745,,0,000-974-850-592-846; 001-343-279-946-435; 001-444-401-468-83X; 001-767-031-026-722; 002-873-032-758-373; 005-879-470-000-235; 007-331-996-765-856; 013-044-506-161-001; 017-029-116-133-38X; 017-841-218-272-732; 017-950-046-880-063; 018-507-291-199-685; 021-725-736-272-165; 023-186-222-727-647; 023-721-636-152-398; 024-190-591-668-61X; 024-410-223-895-378; 024-815-787-987-361; 025-273-309-405-526; 026-988-046-420-040; 028-253-747-326-183; 028-616-142-121-345; 029-237-570-613-369; 034-565-211-138-328; 038-199-658-596-841; 038-337-847-964-618; 043-239-920-470-748; 044-644-459-416-772; 045-664-003-554-522; 046-832-286-224-748; 047-256-171-204-767; 047-462-073-739-239; 047-754-382-199-453; 047-966-117-907-53X; 054-168-010-210-537; 060-218-258-693-00X; 061-123-199-590-776; 064-932-046-831-144; 065-834-944-136-626; 071-595-117-299-458; 071-733-227-167-07X; 073-892-767-581-299; 077-217-944-576-412; 078-453-148-284-102; 079-151-388-368-391; 080-105-518-619-450; 081-450-197-798-016; 081-667-057-524-184; 084-703-926-403-419; 087-228-473-950-231; 090-031-408-689-419; 090-383-759-683-798; 095-921-651-452-442; 097-535-475-911-335; 099-347-307-398-557; 099-632-707-150-545; 101-284-837-741-206; 116-574-875-797-892; 117-412-958-132-575; 118-080-488-992-690; 121-002-906-450-670; 121-995-943-980-434; 124-533-351-959-896; 125-090-442-183-110; 129-522-169-637-514; 130-584-741-063-697; 131-739-877-490-655; 135-714-964-305-272; 137-236-865-208-214; 142-044-534-822-230; 143-567-959-105-826; 144-818-900-544-226; 160-533-952-608-78X; 161-699-625-992-960; 193-909-931-113-622,8
027-088-240-338-262,Active Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons and when Parametric Assumptions Don't Help,2016-06-28,2016,,arXiv: Learning,,,,Reinhard Heckel; Nihar B. Shah; Kannan Ramchandran; Martin J. Wainwright,"We consider sequential or active ranking of a set of n items based on noisy pairwise comparisons. Items are ranked according to the probability that a given item beats a randomly chosen item, and ranking refers to partitioning the items into sets of pre-specified sizes according to their scores. This notion of ranking includes as special cases the identification of the top-k items and the total ordering of the items. We first analyze a sequential ranking algorithm that counts the number of comparisons won, and uses these counts to decide whether to stop, or to compare another pair of items, chosen based on confidence intervals specified by the data collected up to that point. We prove that this algorithm succeeds in recovering the ranking using a number of comparisons that is optimal up to logarithmic factors. This guarantee does not require any structural properties of the underlying pairwise probability matrix, unlike a significant body of past work on pairwise ranking based on parametric models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce models. It has been a long-standing open question as to whether or not imposing these parametric assumptions allows for improved ranking algorithms. For stochastic comparison models, in which the pairwise probabilities are bounded away from zero, our second contribution is to resolve this issue by proving a lower bound for parametric models. This shows, perhaps surprisingly, that these popular parametric modeling choices offer at most logarithmic gains for stochastic comparisons.",,,,,Statistics; Parametric statistics; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Parametric model; Mathematics; Stochastic matrix; Upper and lower bounds; Learning to rank,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08842.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1606.08842 https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08842 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08842,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.08842.pdf,,,2547116930,,0,000-685-849-415-665; 001-082-472-098-914; 003-722-377-136-05X; 004-592-207-796-606; 011-066-427-330-342; 017-071-953-596-68X; 030-669-324-248-532; 030-713-561-106-154; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-230-411-215-161; 047-389-105-123-933; 050-943-988-713-681; 055-703-434-998-944; 067-762-546-777-826; 070-282-043-787-112; 074-476-690-145-141; 080-343-151-945-404; 080-418-584-620-246; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 098-131-351-687-314; 134-439-485-894-444; 135-293-348-356-137; 135-633-208-305-571; 137-940-671-974-155; 141-738-960-256-040; 147-543-426-548-72X; 152-046-251-805-459; 155-729-366-689-349; 163-901-691-956-641; 173-849-173-940-516; 181-375-967-075-390; 196-686-533-213-568,23

Young; Neville A. Stanton,"Annett (2001) has made an in-depth critique of subjectivity in science, concentrating not only on those rating scales which are extensively used in ergonomics, but also the very philosophy of subjectivism itself. The present authors take this critique and use it to reappraise their own interpretation of mental workload, a key concept popularly assessed by subjective measurement. Having recently proposed a definition of mental workload (Young & Stanton, 2001), the present commentary considers deeper problems of subjectivity in the interpretation, perception, and measurement of mental workload. It is realised that there are fundamental problems inherent with such a subjective concept, particularly concerned with the dependence on context and lack of an absolute metric. However, it is also noted that the very point of ergonomics is to address contextual influences on human performance. Therefore, in the absence of a complete paradigm shift in ergonomics, the discipline will have to either accept or find ways of coping with the problems of subjectivity",45,14,1018,1020,Psychology; Human factors and ergonomics; Cognitive psychology; Subjectivity; Perception; Workload; Subjectivism; Paradigm shift; Coping (psychology); Social psychology; Rating scale,,"Ergonomics; Humans; Psychometrics; Qualitative Research; Reproducibility of Results; Research Design; Self Efficacy; Stress, Psychological; Workload/psychology",,,https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/1989 https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/1989/1/It%e2%80%99s%20all%20relative-%20Defining%20mental%20workload%20in%20the%20light%20of%20Annett%202002%20Young%20%26%20Stanton%20%28postprint%29.pdf https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00140130210166816 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12569059 https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/73758/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00140130210166816,12569059,10.1080/00140130210166816,2157940183,,0,007-983-488-493-739; 011-797-116-120-363; 015-623-032-956-177; 016-082-962-272-49X; 076-655-292-298-069; 082-537-373-879-471; 137-304-221-009-203,12

Callan; Ana I. Gheorghiu; William Matthews,"Across five studies, we found consistent evidence for the idea that personal relative deprivation (PRD), which refers to resentment stemming from the belief that one is deprived of deserved outcomes compared to others, uniquely contributes to materialism. In Study 1, self-reports of PRD positively predicted materialistic values over and above socioeconomic status, personal power, self-esteem, and emotional uncertainty. The experience of PRD starts with social comparison, and Studies 2 and 3 found that PRD mediated the positive relation between a tendency to make social comparisons of abilities and materialism. In Study 4, participants who learned that they had less (vs. similar) discretionary income than people like them reported a stronger desire for more money relative to donating more to charity. In Study 5, during a windfall-spending task, participants higher in PRD spent more on things they wanted relative to other spending categories (e.g., paying off debts).",56,2,373,392,Debt; Social status; Materialism; Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Consumer behaviour; Relative deprivation; Resentment; Social psychology,consumer behaviour; materialism; personal relative deprivation; social comparison; social status,"Adult; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Personal Satisfaction; Power, Psychological; Self Concept; Social Class; Uncertainty; Young Adult",,Leverhulme Trust; Economic and Social Research Council,https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/11215279/Social_comparison_personal_relative_deprivation.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878836 https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12176 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/social-comparison-personal-relative-deprivation-and-materialism(08b28788-430f-4756-9baf-5c5a5f1b8911).html https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/social-comparison-personal-relative-deprivation-and-materialism https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjso.12176 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/18214/ http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/262090 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12176 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27878836 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjso.12176 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/694601 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74375062.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12176,27878836,10.1111/bjso.12176,2551498008,PMC5484278,0,000-360-514-408-29X; 000-517-343-381-928; 001-383-131-749-503; 001-400-042-277-606; 004-853-761-708-602; 005-062-928-856-814; 006-086-152-011-293; 008-099-367-741-969; 008-628-647-679-259; 010-249-618-179-070; 011-587-706-238-913; 011-670-060-593-55X; 015-526-346-623-469; 015-636-956-947-919; 015-927-570-151-897; 017-161-738-125-868; 018-057-489-952-681; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-036-216-509-253; 023-251-704-202-593; 024-652-274-818-85X; 025-724-556-647-792; 027-633-256-532-036; 028-522-914-914-349; 029-053-023-130-054; 031-107-770-345-73X; 032-025-006-709-574; 032-115-532-650-719; 034-736-994-010-809; 036-893-381-358-37X; 038-937-808-224-704; 039-862-360-031-914; 047-024-487-891-169; 052-053-960-162-740; 052-684-034-162-590; 060-577-386-644-004; 060-787-744-628-035; 065-358-145-514-884; 067-273-911-484-101; 071-946-997-805-217; 072-927-335-796-502; 073-262-296-322-170; 076-170-356-078-589; 079-108-871-882-776; 079-554-517-641-187; 080-877-444-998-725; 086-215-959-595-920; 088-361-442-798-969; 102-255-932-276-035; 104-081-095-630-388; 108-058-094-921-36X; 114-615-906-848-062; 116-326-989-111-446; 125-715-569-537-446; 126-454-480-733-794; 128-705-101-271-89X; 132-578-094-443-168; 140-772-753-830-217; 150-372-244-980-17X; 151-324-787-046-842; 152-283-351-756-956; 164-348-466-925-780; 168-012-337-457-243; 185-126-281-331-802; 186-136-796-884-030,24

This paper explores a quite different method of assessment using ‘Adaptive Comparative Judgement’ (ACJ) that was developed within a research project at Goldsmiths University of London between 2004 and 2010. The method was developed into a tool that enabled judges to distinguish better/worse performances not by allocating numbers through mark schemes, but rather by direct, holistic, judgement. The tool was successfully deployed through a series of national and international research and development exercises. But game-changing innovations are never flaw-less first time out (Golley, Jet: Frank Whittle and the Invention of the Jet Engine, Datum Publishing, Liphook Hampshire, 2009; Dyson, Against the odds: an autobiography, Texere Publishing, Knutsford Cheshire, 2001) and a series of careful investigations resulted in a problem being identified within the workings of ACJ (Bramley, Investigating the reliability of Adaptive Comparative Judgment, Cambridge Assessment Research Report, UK, Cambridge, 2015). The issue was with the ‘adaptive’ component of the algorithm that, under certain conditions, appeared to exaggerate the reliability statistic. The problem was ‘worked’ by the software company running ACJ and a solution found. This paper reports the whole sequence of events—from the original innovation, through deployment, the emergent problem, and the resulting solution that was published at an international conference (Rangel Smith and Lynch in: PATT36 International Conference. Research & Practice in Technology Education: Perspectives on Human Capacity and Development, 2018) and subsequently deployed within a modified ACJ algorithm.",,,1,15,Software deployment; Engineering management; Odds; Publishing; Educational technology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Computer science; Science education; Technology education,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,,10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,3131726837,,0,003-019-903-218-043; 006-719-044-652-648; 007-775-768-494-369; 012-145-631-812-551; 012-962-168-631-344; 015-035-210-409-280; 022-886-709-886-069; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 055-875-865-161-135; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 074-813-203-051-83X; 075-548-610-945-867; 080-893-480-467-569; 083-130-316-203-709; 091-465-380-379-025; 106-681-332-176-644; 108-462-313-507-607; 119-113-819-818-430; 126-875-389-752-711; 133-529-167-198-85X; 149-208-961-050-864; 160-928-885-215-092; 169-132-973-382-548,0

Chorus,"This paper proposes a discrete mixture model which assigns individuals, up to a probability, to either a class of random utility (RU) maximizers or a class of random regret (RR) minimizers, on the basis of their sequence of observed choices. Our proposed model advances the state of the art of RU–RR mixture models by (i) adding and simultaneously estimating a membership model which predicts the probability of belonging to a RU or RR class; (ii) adding a layer of random taste heterogeneity within each behavioural class; and (iii) deriving a welfare measure associated with the RU–RR mixture model and consistent with referendum-voting, which is the adequate mechanism of provision for such local public goods. The context of our empirical application is a stated choice experiment concerning traffic calming schemes. We find that the random parameter RU–RR mixture model not only outperforms its fixed coefficient counterpart in terms of fit—as expected—but also in terms of plausibility of membership determinants of behavioural class. In line with psychological theories of regret, we find that, compared to respondents who are familiar with the choice context (i.e. the traffic calming scheme), unfamiliar respondents are more likely to be regret minimizers than utility maximizers.",61,,121,135,Statistics; Minification; Econometrics; Public good; Economics; Maximization; Traffic calming; Poison control; Regret; Mixture model; Stochastic process,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856414000044 https://research.tudelft.nl/en/publications/stated-choices-and-benefit-estimates-in-the-context-of-traffic-ca https://pure.qub.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/stated-choices-and-benefit-estimates-in-the-context-of-traffic-calming-schemes(b1e71d04-4de3-4943-a156-582d18d75fc0)/fingerprints.html https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/transa/v61y2014icp121-135.html http://core.ac.uk/display/19757768 https://iris.univr.it/handle/11562/861966 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856414000044 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/17429/ https://econpapers.repec.org/article/eeetransa/v_3a61_3ay_3a2014_3ai_3ac_3ap_3a121-135.htm https://www.rti.org/publication/stated-choices-and-benefit-estimates-context-traffic-calming-schemes-utility https://trid.trb.org/view/1305719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tra.2014.01.003,,10.1016/j.tra.2014.01.003,2065787939,,0,003-151-614-297-070; 005-172-289-137-596; 005-844-689-987-193; 011-226-085-814-653; 015-396-400-600-856; 016-757-566-136-632; 017-021-826-747-136; 021-717-813-601-621; 023-903-896-872-698; 026-641-643-521-701; 029-820-436-110-072; 032-063-833-367-317; 033-503-033-878-71X; 033-937-403-200-198; 035-097-147-017-063; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-003-275-167-999; 040-921-258-186-269; 042-627-416-303-850; 043-013-889-047-084; 045-532-835-274-81X; 048-207-539-832-434; 052-504-350-746-802; 056-804-029-209-138; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-547-682-120-644; 064-727-553-617-895; 066-440-172-502-95X; 069-441-583-696-414; 074-071-861-181-580; 087-412-597-244-072; 091-600-098-706-618; 094-317-829-514-085; 098-376-587-660-420; 101-798-673-944-530; 102-332-818-772-664; 103-056-993-198-151; 104-566-678-784-034; 105-273-971-803-369; 106-535-446-210-729; 107-943-747-597-233; 108-496-730-640-172; 110-766-828-083-684; 111-699-411-419-639; 114-308-229-035-67X; 130-226-647-065-215; 143-021-635-057-026; 145-150-460-267-796; 149-369-268-819-820; 156-010-669-375-338; 156-830-811-213-932; 158-403-210-085-10X; 159-442-176-910-767; 160-928-311-809-879; 177-607-724-658-925; 185-103-684-415-654; 186-309-881-732-835; 195-614-022-168-268,27

Researchers have claimed that people attribute human nature traits more strongly to themselves than to others, but not uniquely human traits. In this article we suggest that such claims are based on the misinterpretation of results. Most studies have not presented mean comparative judgments, making it impossible to determine whether people thought they possessed characteristics less strongly or more strongly than the average person. We found that people (N = 256) in Poland, Italy, and Korea perceived themselves as possessing desirable human nature and uniquely human characteristics more than others, as possessing undesirable uniquely human traits less than others, and as similar to others in terms of undesirable human nature characteristics.

Nicholls,"We investigated the claim that larger stimuli are perceived to last longer (Xuan, Zhang, He, & Chen, 2007). This claim, alongwith other similar claims of interactions between magnitude representations, is frequently used to support the generalizedmagnitude system hypothesis—the suggestion that the brain represents information about different magnitudes (e.g., time,space, and quantity) via a common mechanism. It is not clear, however, whether the size of a stimulus genuinely affects theperceived duration of the stimulus or simply biases decisions about duration. This was addressed using duration ‘‘equalityjudgments,’’ which have been proposed to measure perceived duration unconfounded by decisional bias—in contrast to‘‘comparative judgments,’’ which are generally considered bias-prone. Using equality judgments, we failed to find supportfor the claim that larger stimuli are perceived to last longer, despite replicating the original effect reported by Xuan et al.(2007) using comparative judgments. Instead, unexpectedly, larger stimuli were judged—though not necessarilyperceived—as shorter in duration. This result casts doubt on the conclusions of a significant body of behavioralinterference studies using comparative judgments, which support a generalized magnitude system. We also identify ahitherto unrecognized potential source of decisional bias associated with equality judgments.Keywords: generalized magnitude system, temporal perception, size-duration interferenceCitation: Yates, M.

Suppose that a collection of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one wishes to recover a consistent ordering that emphasizes the top-K ranked items, based on partially revealed preferences. We focus on the Bradley-Terry-Luce model that postulates a set of latent preference scores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only on the relative scores of the items involved.; ; We characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-K ranked items, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results highlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores between the Kth and (K + 1)th ranked items. The minimum sample complexity required for reliable top-K ranking scales inversely with the separation measure. To approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme, called Spectral MLE, that returns the indices of the top-K items in accordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with an initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral method), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of coordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-K item identification under minimal sample complexity. The practical applicability of Spectral MLE is further corroborated by numerical experiments.",,,371,380,Statistics; Identifiability; Odds; Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Spectral method; Aggregation problem; Mathematics; Sampling (statistics),,,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/chena15.html http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/chena15.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3045159 http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/proceedings/papers/v37/chena15.pdf https://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v37/chena15.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icml/icml2015.html#ChenS15 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1504.html#ChenS15a,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v37/chena15.html,,,2963177480,,0,001-571-051-609-613; 001-631-224-533-795; 004-848-515-510-16X; 007-275-914-246-021; 008-510-382-037-766; 010-132-302-334-522; 010-136-645-510-231; 015-619-786-644-899; 015-784-140-504-853; 023-478-492-046-416; 027-481-550-045-191; 030-713-561-106-154; 032-718-506-620-930; 033-240-242-918-034; 046-018-577-916-49X; 047-307-839-107-965; 047-587-036-856-574; 050-943-988-713-681; 051-173-879-787-575; 051-597-751-617-947; 054-013-791-330-77X; 057-386-771-872-724; 067-769-988-951-117; 067-860-359-894-241; 074-476-690-145-141; 075-376-671-118-947; 081-370-959-105-221; 082-555-883-092-977; 087-351-485-660-85X; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-033-188-521-321; 092-474-419-202-077; 095-796-854-058-760; 096-979-791-156-213; 109-634-740-013-008; 109-668-006-494-690; 123-524-633-373-163; 123-865-608-498-496; 131-047-904-013-866; 136-510-755-969-787; 147-598-171-242-70X; 149-228-667-566-569; 151-714-568-288-992; 153-121-694-099-331; 154-209-779-028-826; 156-403-614-670-353; 161-247-307-055-667; 163-901-691-956-641; 168-838-973-937-775; 172-520-776-223-903; 173-849-173-940-516; 192-803-196-532-780; 198-992-205-481-502,40

Montag,"The method of paired comparison based on Thurstone's case V of his law of comparative judgments is often used as a psy- chophysical method to derive interval scales of perceptual qualities in imaging applications. However, methods for determining confi- dence intervals and critical distances for significant differences have been elusive, leading some to abandon the simple analysis provided by Thurstone's formulation. Monte Carlo simulations of paired com- parison experiments were performed in order to derive an empirical formula for determining error. The results show that the variation in the distribution of experimental results can be well predicted as a function of stimulus number and the number of observations. Using these results, confidence intervals and critical values for compari- sons can be made using traditional statistical methods. © 2006 SPIE",15,1,010502,,Statistics; Thurstone scale; Error bar; Monte Carlo method; Empirical formula; Paired comparison; Computer science; Confidence interval; Image quality; Image processing,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jei/jei15.html#Montag06 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ethan_Montag/publication/220050889_Empirical_formula_for_creating_error_bars_for_the_method_of_paired_comparison/links/0c96052b2f22441a8a000000.pdf https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Electronic-Imaging/volume-15/issue-01/010502/Empirical-formula-for-creating-error-bars-for-the-method-of/10.1117/1.2181547.full https://digitalarchive.rit.edu/xmlui/handle/1850/3015 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2006JEI....15a0502M/abstract https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Journal-of-Electronic-Imaging/volume-15/issue-1/010502/Empirical-formula-for-creating-error-bars-for-the-method-of/10.1117/1.2181547.pdf https://electronicimaging.spiedigitallibrary.org/article.aspx?articleid=1098794 http://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/PDFs/JEI010502.pdf https://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/PDFs/JEI010502.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.2181547,,10.1117/1.2181547,2101295291,,0,000-377-083-577-34X; 034-246-528-290-581; 035-776-610-863-582; 063-314-964-834-008; 065-906-991-595-286; 072-470-410-274-388; 113-278-954-446-219; 121-161-560-636-803; 125-506-752-898-572; 197-589-355-993-62X; 198-754-631-432-902,46

McAdoo; Scott D. Gronlund,"Many in the eyewitness identification community believe that sequential lineups are superior to simultaneous lineups because simultaneous lineups encourage inappropriate choosing due to promoting comparisons among choices (a relative judgment strategy), but sequential lineups reduce this propensity by inducing comparisons of lineup members directly to memory rather than to each other (an absolute judgment strategy). Different versions of the relative judgment theory have implicated both discrete-state and continuous mediation of eyewitness decisions. The theory has never been formally specified, but (Yonelinas, J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 20:1341–1354, 1994) dual-process models provide one possible specification, thereby allowing us to evaluate how eyewitness decisions are mediated. We utilized a ranking task (Kellen and Klauer, J Exp Psychol Learn Mem Cogn 40:1795–1804, 2014) and found evidence for continuous mediation when facial stimuli match from study to test (Experiment 1) and when they mismatch (Experiment 2). This evidence, which is contrary to a version of relative judgment theory that has gained a lot of traction in the legal community, compels reassessment of the role that guessing plays in eyewitness identification. Future research should continue to test formal explanations in order to advance theory, expedite the development of new procedures that can enhance the reliability of eyewitness evidence, and to facilitate the exploration of task factors and emergent strategies that might influence when recognition is continuously or discretely mediated.",1,1,11,11,Experimental psychology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Ranking; Mediation (Marxist theory and media studies); Eyewitness identification; Facial recognition system; Social psychology,Eyewitness identification; Facial recognition; One-high-threshold (1HT) model; Relative and absolute judgments; Signal-detection theory (SDT),,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5256444 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/28180162 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s41235-016-0014-7 https://core.ac.uk/display/81839183 http://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s41235-016-0014-7 https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-016-0014-7 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81839183.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s41235-016-0014-7,28180162,10.1186/s41235-016-0014-7,2529832152,PMC5256444,0,001-592-260-026-599; 002-645-018-173-809; 005-367-204-029-159; 014-779-800-712-680; 015-415-510-206-770; 016-130-971-281-754; 017-709-961-737-278; 017-779-761-257-45X; 018-714-338-296-493; 019-102-912-761-02X; 024-942-918-005-092; 025-737-152-935-977; 026-546-233-512-76X; 030-485-583-923-057; 030-784-682-944-793; 033-146-667-545-017; 037-008-152-626-803; 037-176-242-119-963; 037-360-364-793-796; 040-710-022-171-634; 041-129-520-060-299; 045-002-903-379-085; 049-408-229-973-829; 050-592-631-254-281; 054-538-565-932-977; 056-093-272-555-489; 063-826-713-793-327; 067-685-503-998-956; 070-387-752-002-083; 070-720-227-943-439; 087-632-891-562-383; 097-414-551-356-919; 097-552-438-912-632; 098-950-015-680-825; 107-403-230-735-085; 108-992-385-700-703; 110-174-123-150-008; 112-555-564-203-066; 114-344-872-373-721; 124-500-525-931-906; 132-621-509-725-011; 163-522-128-650-379; 199-055-961-488-187,2

Indicators provide essential links among strategy, execution and ultimate value creation. The aim of this paper is to develop a framework, which identifies and prioritizes Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) that a company should focus on them to define and measure progress towards organizational objectives. For this purpose, an applied research was conducted in 2013 in an Iranian telecommunication company. We first determined the objectives of the company with respect to four perspectives of BSC (Balanced Scorecard) framework. Next, performance indicators were listed and paired wise comparisons were accomplished by company's high-ranked employees through standard Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) questionnaires. This helped us establish the weight of each indicator and to rank them, accordingly. © 2014 Growing Science Ltd. All rights reserved.

This Academic Assessment Index (AAI) is based on the responses of 109 university and college administrators (chairpersons, department heads, and deans) in a national survey. Based on the Law of Comparative Judgment, the AAI was developed from a statistical analysis of these responses. The results may provide an important perspective on the difficult issue of how faculty career advancement portfolios including teaching, scholarly works, and service activities are judged by senior colleagues and administrators. Background There is perhaps no task more difficult, or more likely to produce controversy, than that of assessing the performance and accomplishments of members of a faculty. A need for such assessment is clear due to the amount of effort and the seriousness of decisions in the recruitment of new faculty, in annual reviews of performance for salary increases, in judging merits for promotion, and in making decisions concerning tenure. If things go wrong in these procedures, hopes can be frustrated, and the wrong people can be hired, fired, promoted, or given tenure. In some cases, lawsuits result. Most institutions make an effort to clarify the basis on which performance will be judged. Typically, these are set forth in a ""Faculty Handbook."" Passages in such publications usually try to explain the criteria on which a member of the faculty will be judged for academic rewards. Some may refer to definitions of ""merit,"" which is used in many institutions for adjustments in salary. Most contain general explanations of relevant criteria to be used for making decisions when the person becomes a candidate for promotion and for deciding on the award of tenure. Historically, then, faculty evaluation traditionally relies on assessing three areas that represent professional achievement: quality of teaching, the quantity and quality of research (or other scholarly products), and the nature and significance of service. Although these three areas are generally used to create an overall assessment of faculty performance;, academic institutions may value these three: areas differently. Although the various expected activities within each of these three areas are fairly universal, the degree to which certain aspects of professional and academic activity are recognized in the promotion and tenure process is less clear. That is, some institutions may view a successful teaching record as the most iiuportant consideration in promotion and tenure decisions. Here, student evaluations, syllabi, or other evidence of student assessment1,2 are recognized according to some sort of continuum or hierarchy of performance. In other cases, publications that might indicate research or scholarly productivity may be the most important determinate of whether a professor's career advances.3 Interestingly, faculty members tend to perceive their own productivity in terms of scholarly research and grants and place less importance on other factors.4 Such variations in which of these areas are regarded as more important are generally related to how a particular college or university is classified. For example, in ""research 1"" institutions, the expectation may be skewed more heavily towards a distinguished publishing record. In such cases, an outstanding evaluation may result, even though minimally acceptable teaching evaluations and service may be indicated in an evaluation. In some four-year colleges, research may not be viewed as all that important. Exceptional teaching and service might be of greater importance as criteria for a promotion and tenure review.5 Thus, differences are to be expected among categories of institutions, while a variety of evaluation methods and weights are used to assess various aspects of professional activities even within homogeneous categories of universities. …",58,3,239,250,Publishing; Psychology; Law of comparative judgment; Seriousness; Salary; Assessment index; Evaluation methods; Hierarchy; Public relations; Syllabus,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-523025121/assessing-faculty-performance-for-merit-an-academic https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769580305800303,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/107769580305800303,,10.1177/107769580305800303,2039015101,,0,,14

Much of the current debate may have confused, rather than enlightened applied researchers because the underlying source of the debate lacks transparency. We argue that this debate would be better served if it were much more closely tied to the large existing literature on optimal design of experiments, where many of the issues currently being discussed have long been examined.

The central claim of this paper is that a biological perspective on education allows one to see past the traditional dichotomies and affords a coherent rationale for a set of curricular priorities by providing the framework necessary to draw principled distinctions between education, training, indoctrination, and enculturation, all without having to draw on contentious politico-ideological commitments.",36,2,167,182,Epistemology; Sociology; Ideology; Philosophy of education; Indoctrination; Enculturation; Education theory; Dichotomy; Acculturation,,,,,https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/file/008c6693-e4dc-4380-a629-f1a9528c6488/1/fulltext.pdf https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/008c6693-e4dc-4380-a629-f1a9528c6488/1/ https://paperity.org/p/75068902/education-from-a-biological-point-of-view https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11217-016-9509-4 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1130700 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81738062.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11217-016-9509-4,,10.1007/s11217-016-9509-4,2290018327,,0,000-812-176-082-534; 010-024-420-863-937; 011-532-423-419-003; 013-188-085-703-273; 028-216-997-470-943; 030-321-668-277-575; 043-148-432-643-140; 052-120-244-776-466; 063-636-834-005-756; 073-483-751-320-96X; 082-059-302-091-608; 104-523-071-483-876; 109-207-547-409-311; 114-481-703-492-683; 119-285-836-290-835; 120-253-855-719-800; 132-923-768-562-476; 144-675-909-618-185; 151-225-340-763-518; 157-027-364-436-07X; 159-833-192-012-500; 186-775-435-686-945; 192-887-272-812-161,3

The stimuli were pairs of animal names that were different in their physical and semantic sizes (e.g., ant lion). Participants were asked to judge which of the two words was larger either in physical or in semantic size. Size congruity effect (i.e., faster reaction times with congruent than with incongruent stimuli) appeared in both semantic and physical judgments. The semantic distance effect (i.e., large semantic distances are processed faster than smaller ones), appeared only when the semantic dimension was relevant to the task. The findings indicate that when a word (animal name) is presented, its meaning is accessed automatically. Part of this meaning (at least with our stimuli) relates to the size of the animal in real life. Processing of meaning of the size of the words is carried out in parallel with the extraction of the physical features of the presented stimuli.",111,1,141,154,Semantics; Semantic similarity; Congruence (geometry); Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; In real life; Automaticity; Communication,,Adult; Analysis of Variance; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Reaction Time; Semantics; Students/psychology,,,https://langnum.haifa.ac.il/articles/rubin/Is%20an%20ant%20larger%20than%20a%20lion.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12102118 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691802000471,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0001-6918(02)00047-1,12102118,10.1016/s0001-6918(02)00047-1,1988807294,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 001-244-253-407-376; 003-375-024-877-035; 006-688-443-167-296; 008-270-037-430-68X; 008-845-782-231-781; 014-080-322-850-333; 014-304-423-897-683; 014-776-573-667-15X; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-382-930-928-27X; 015-882-949-708-585; 019-777-112-821-405; 025-902-904-052-699; 026-052-656-735-076; 047-116-933-879-118; 047-949-982-406-946; 060-779-949-886-150; 066-347-812-817-436; 071-044-230-927-62X; 088-849-249-876-733; 104-901-364-255-979; 109-899-292-094-572; 109-926-662-069-886; 116-093-617-267-98X; 144-747-377-111-26X; 153-174-100-314-196; 160-243-638-226-569,49

Acoustic analysis is carried out by means of a generalized variogram to extract vocal dysperiodicities. The corpus comprises four French sentences as well as vowels [a] produced by 22 male and female normophonic and dysphonic speakers. It is shown that the multiband signal-to-dysperiodicity ratios correlate better with perceptual scores of hoarseness than the global signal-to-dysperiodicity ratio. The highest correlations are achieved by the acoustic marker based on linear regression analysis of the segmental signal-to-dysperiodiciy ratios in different non-overlapping frequency bands. The perceptual scores are based on comparative judgments by six listeners of pairs of speech tokens.,1,2,137,143,Variogram; Perception; Connected speech; Speech recognition; Frame based; Mathematics; Linear regression,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809406000280 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1746809406000280 https://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/70583/Details https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/bspc/bspc1.html#KachaGS06 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2006.07.002 https://core.ac.uk/display/8869227,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.bspc.2006.07.002,,10.1016/j.bspc.2006.07.002,2082879117,,0,000-848-295-303-162; 001-929-753-464-723; 003-013-245-397-432; 003-160-755-622-505; 009-525-844-368-999; 012-580-959-109-823; 013-993-451-192-971; 016-078-293-499-483; 028-332-745-625-580; 041-254-579-563-053; 060-359-129-566-396; 069-374-371-316-769; 070-728-548-117-142; 072-368-788-309-887; 088-773-390-532-069; 107-634-475-710-220; 109-157-396-244-157; 175-136-862-171-196,6

This view of perception as inference allows a new perspective on the role of affect in perception. Affect and interoception are closely linked, but processes underlying this link are poorly understood. We suggest that a predictive coding perspective allows acknowledging affect as integral part of information processing. We outline how affect may intrinsically modify processes of interoception by acting as threshold mechanism in stimulus grouping and information compression. We outline how well-established methods, for example, from categorization research may allow quantifying this influence of affect on perception in empirical tests of predictive coding models. We discuss how this may enrich the study of the relationship between affect and interoception and may have important clinical relevance.",6,,1408,1408,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Inference; Predictive coding; Interoception; Information compression; Social psychology; Information processing; Categorization,affect; categorization; interoception; predictive coding; symptom perception,,,Fonds National de la Recherche Luxembourg,https://core.ac.uk/display/82883679 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4585108/ https://philpapers.org/rec/PETIAT-6 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01408/full https://orbilu.uni.lu/handle/10993/21991 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4585108 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01408/full https://orbilu.uni.lu/bitstream/10993/21991/1/fpsyg-06-01408%20%282%29.pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01408/abstract https://publications.uni.lu/handle/10993/21991 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82883679.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01408,26441780,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01408,1943589862,PMC4585108,0,000-666-974-605-042; 001-026-305-014-449; 001-188-915-091-451; 005-134-997-795-39X; 005-316-932-452-094; 010-622-427-088-136; 011-173-148-119-951; 013-871-409-552-536; 014-776-680-806-696; 016-029-797-226-197; 016-409-084-935-721; 016-967-556-228-520; 017-176-610-070-791; 018-037-099-625-820; 018-550-047-521-146; 018-844-889-376-364; 019-636-245-595-545; 019-761-506-332-659; 020-781-887-458-784; 024-277-376-856-791; 027-995-610-677-771; 029-825-036-388-836; 031-039-236-564-279; 035-310-442-637-919; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-602-359-969-809; 040-056-653-375-832; 040-097-223-632-537; 040-169-399-952-841; 040-721-197-806-324; 042-441-725-051-145; 042-491-649-124-888; 042-620-448-856-124; 042-678-073-461-071; 043-031-648-797-748; 043-836-093-052-774; 045-104-090-036-823; 046-463-567-520-892; 047-677-651-485-102; 048-670-595-369-573; 049-881-288-003-148; 050-742-926-818-743; 058-254-821-335-698; 060-507-114-916-359; 061-072-031-457-923; 061-809-572-646-878; 067-074-143-648-086; 067-895-314-425-038; 070-546-261-771-852; 072-299-864-251-95X; 076-761-781-001-94X; 078-430-300-336-076; 079-353-555-366-429; 079-460-626-124-923; 084-011-523-439-436; 086-869-748-720-157; 090-140-508-002-023; 093-076-241-631-853; 097-677-927-488-210; 098-063-567-409-67X; 099-755-329-148-201; 102-015-367-754-918; 102-426-057-669-992; 103-616-026-433-606; 104-050-549-892-517; 106-992-479-811-970; 112-625-229-585-029; 120-241-972-611-497; 124-034-668-071-135; 128-467-656-063-09X; 131-766-263-810-558; 155-777-361-798-534; 162-001-061-859-302; 168-373-464-845-533,11

Shadlen,"“Degree of certainty” refers to the subjective belief, prior to feedback, that a decision is correct. A reliable estimate of certainty is essential for prediction, learning from mistakes, and planning subsequent actions when outcomes are not immediate. It is generally thought that certainty is informed by a neural representation of evidence at the time of a decision. Here we show that certainty is also informed by the time taken to form the decision. Human subjects reported simultaneously their choice and confidence about the direction of a noisy display of moving dots. Certainty was inversely correlated with reaction times and directly correlated with motion strength. Moreover, these correlations were preserved even for error responses, a finding that contradicts existing explanations of certainty based on signal detection theory. We also contrived a stimulus manipulation that led to longer decision times without affecting choice accuracy, thus demonstrating that deliberation time itself informs the estimate of certainty. We suggest that elapsed decision time informs certainty because it serves as a proxy for task difficulty.",84,6,1329,1342,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Deliberation; Decision confidence; Degree of certainty; Motion perception; Certainty; Social psychology,,Choice Behavior/physiology; Eye Movements/physiology; Female; Humans; Motion Perception/physiology; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time/physiology; Uncertainty; Young Adult,,NEI NIH HHS (P30 EY013079) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY011378) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY11378) United States; Howard Hughes Medical Institute United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4271191 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314010964 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/choice-certainty-informed-both-evidence-decision-time/ http://www.cns.nyu.edu/kianilab/papers/Kiani_Corthell_Shadlen_2014.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/82493412 https://www.shadlenlab.columbia.edu/publications/publications/mike/KianiNeuron2014.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25521381 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/choice-certainty-is-informed-by-both-evidence-and-decision-time https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627314010964 https://www.cell.com/neuron/pdf/S0896-6273(14)01096-4.pdf https://www.cell.com/neuron/abstract/S0896-6273(14)01096-4 https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(14)01096-4 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82493412.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.015,25521381,10.1016/j.neuron.2014.12.015,2101518352,PMC4271191,0,000-714-989-693-755; 002-859-575-994-742; 004-330-579-129-716; 004-907-262-026-763; 004-961-011-433-134; 005-439-218-514-868; 006-329-999-924-032; 006-545-670-245-348; 006-861-327-640-943; 007-023-953-914-108; 007-035-445-016-270; 007-849-544-022-871; 009-380-689-254-718; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-183-864-154-212; 013-640-048-806-220; 014-677-379-840-306; 014-821-746-260-201; 015-301-215-374-266; 019-567-702-794-034; 019-608-054-640-309; 022-045-149-905-439; 022-203-329-792-823; 022-513-574-133-227; 023-392-288-632-015; 026-774-982-271-371; 026-917-628-232-594; 029-562-253-747-477; 031-547-071-697-292; 033-148-314-491-964; 034-408-543-858-189; 034-548-898-277-230; 034-742-539-488-932; 036-229-783-159-175; 036-490-234-502-291; 036-748-447-200-073; 038-228-182-715-074; 039-074-491-355-399; 040-320-072-283-673; 044-161-468-943-922; 045-054-387-669-338; 049-239-335-673-18X; 050-654-714-605-21X; 052-302-477-717-27X; 053-184-942-489-404; 054-526-402-379-742; 054-829-527-775-966; 057-891-351-367-147; 060-043-869-622-727; 061-112-187-905-597; 062-519-425-089-718; 063-110-370-129-69X; 064-067-200-199-041; 064-109-017-992-845; 067-257-768-649-224; 076-655-292-298-069; 077-080-252-973-99X; 078-310-223-924-467; 080-862-752-679-214; 085-705-756-388-855; 086-440-116-937-399; 087-077-553-083-806; 088-863-106-512-706; 092-586-670-668-180; 094-289-727-015-730; 096-982-792-680-946; 102-015-367-754-918; 104-191-710-128-689; 105-882-128-582-949; 108-223-658-235-08X; 109-357-504-752-279; 114-002-500-313-752; 116-208-128-128-978; 118-744-169-325-523; 122-296-739-914-951; 122-739-211-268-189; 145-181-805-072-153; 178-535-113-631-236; 199-055-961-488-187,243

Thomson; York Winter,"The capacity to discriminate between choice options is crucial for a decision-maker to avoid unprofitable options. The physical properties of rewards are presumed to be represented on context-dependent, nonlinear cognitive scales that may systematically influence reward expectation and thus choice behavior. In this study, we investigated the discrimination performance of free-flying bumblebee workers (Bombus impatiens) in a choice between sucrose solutions with different concentrations. We conducted two-alternative free choice experiments on two B. impatiens colonies containing some electronically tagged bumblebees foraging at an array of computer-automated artificial flowers that recorded individual choices. We mimicked natural foraging conditions by allowing uncertainty in the probability of reward delivery while maintaining certainty in reward concentration. We used a Bayesian approach to fit psychometric functions, relating the strength of preference for the higher concentration option to the relative intensity of the presented stimuli. Psychometric analysis was performed on visitation data from individually marked bumblebees and pooled data from unmarked individuals. Bumblebees preferred the more concentrated sugar solutions at high stimulus intensities and showed no preference at low stimulus intensities. The obtained psychometric function is consistent with reward evaluation based on perceived concentration contrast between choices. We found no evidence that bumblebees reduce reward expectations upon experiencing non-rewarded visits. We compare psychometric function parameters between the bumblebee B. impatiens and the flower bat Glossophaga commissarisi and discuss the relevance of psychophysics for pollinator-exerted selection pressures on plants.",16,3,417,427,Statistics; Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Psychology; Foraging; Cognition; Psychometric function; Bumblebee; Bombus impatiens; Impatiens; Social psychology,,"Animals; Bees/physiology; Choice Behavior; Discrimination, Psychological; Feeding Behavior; Food Preferences; Sucrose",Sucrose,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81723106 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3625420/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/James_Thomson13/publication/233769150_The_psychophysics_of_sugar_concentration_discrimination_and_contrast_evaluation_in_bumblebees/links/54c7a6140cf22d626a36c9f4.pdf http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23179111 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10071-012-0582-y https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10071-012-0582-y https://paperity.org/p/5246337/the-psychophysics-of-sugar-concentration-discrimination-and-contrast-evaluation-in https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81723106.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10071-012-0582-y,23179111,10.1007/s10071-012-0582-y,1984267818,PMC3625420,0,002-551-237-052-786; 003-205-260-590-835; 003-464-247-609-489; 004-183-124-020-629; 004-280-752-684-762; 007-347-516-071-174; 007-679-572-119-460; 010-187-743-570-895; 011-593-366-191-960; 011-736-333-875-843; 012-705-124-119-392; 014-581-464-093-572; 014-650-441-870-478; 018-807-296-668-916; 019-621-977-440-600; 020-916-066-437-463; 023-655-725-853-126; 025-390-760-493-770; 027-175-169-076-225; 028-142-115-667-690; 029-274-288-682-638; 032-416-488-451-139; 034-578-763-618-437; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-466-213-059-905; 038-975-507-113-40X; 039-398-077-601-735; 041-659-281-349-623; 043-159-231-699-862; 044-280-733-995-101; 047-207-828-986-417; 047-312-335-943-958; 048-246-936-505-068; 051-541-879-587-30X; 060-402-094-755-218; 060-893-590-008-157; 062-536-778-519-538; 070-571-836-868-255; 074-740-102-759-658; 077-896-042-387-919; 089-581-544-778-193; 089-854-229-220-713; 090-196-641-302-562; 091-814-028-345-11X; 093-075-439-926-628; 096-995-606-941-982; 108-133-057-717-13X; 111-436-540-328-552; 117-618-669-987-298; 118-039-488-205-525; 119-382-663-117-552; 124-396-129-700-711; 127-476-428-346-264; 129-625-086-978-913; 135-357-773-691-016; 137-827-942-118-189; 138-362-692-802-04X; 150-325-162-873-23X; 152-851-921-965-411; 159-281-182-870-138; 166-504-306-571-826; 176-263-552-819-688; 187-468-004-368-642; 198-821-450-406-139,14

Evans; Ronald L. Rivest; Philip B. Stark,"Author(s): Evans, SN; Rivest, RL; Stark, PB | Abstract: © 2019 ISI/BS Schools with the highest average student performance are often the smallest schools; localities with the highest rates of some cancers are frequently small; and the effects observed in clinical trials are likely to be largest for the smallest numbers of subjects. Informal explanations of this “small-schools phenomenon” point to the fact that the sample means of smaller samples have higher variances. But this cannot be a complete explanation: If we draw two samples from a diffuse distribution that is symmetric about some point, then the chance that the smaller sample has larger mean is 50%. A particular consequence of results proved below is that if one draws three or more samples of different sizes from the same normal distribution, then the sample mean of the smallest sample is most likely to be highest, the sample mean of the second smallest sample is second most likely to be highest, and so on; this is true even though for any pair of samples, each one of the pair is equally likely to have the larger sample mean. The same effect explains why heteroscedasticity can result in misleadingly small nominal p-values in nonparametric tests of association. Our conclusions are relevant to certain stochastic choice models, including the following generalization of Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment. There are n items. Item i is preferred to item j if Zi l Zj, where Z is a random n-vector of preference scores. Suppose P{Zi = Zj} = 0 for i = j, so there are no ties. Item k is the favorite if Zk l mini=k Zi. Let pi denote the chance that item i is the favorite. We characterize a large class of distributions for Z for which p1 g p2 g · · · g pn. Our results are most surprising when P{Zi l Zj} = P{Zi g Zj} = 12 for i = j, so neither of any two items is likely to be preferred over the other in a pairwise comparison. Then, under suitable assumptions, p1 g p2 g · · · g pn when the variability of Zi decreases with i in an appropriate sense. Our conclusions echo the proverb “Fortune favors the bold”.",25,1,26,46,Heteroscedasticity; Normal distribution; Nonparametric statistics; Combinatorics; Extreme value theory; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Pairwise comparison; Mathematics; Order statistic,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/52h1r834 https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.bj/1544605237,http://dx.doi.org/10.3150/17-bej930,,10.3150/17-bej930,2963343185,,0,,0

Goffin; James M. Olson,"We argue that various types of evaluative social judgments about the self or others (e.g., employee job performance ratings, self-reported attitudes, ratings of others' traits) may be obtained more accurately using comparative ratings rather than absolute ratings. Comparative ratings involve relative judgments of a target in comparison with other individuals or groups, whereas absolute ratings involve judgments of a target on scales that do not explicitly reference other people. In industrial-organizational, social, and personality psychology research that has compared the validity of comparative and absolute ratings, we have found evidence of more valid measurement as a result of comparative judgmental ratings, despite the nearly exclusive reliance on absolute judgmental ratings in these areas. We offer a social cognitive and evolutionary explanation in support of the hypothesis that humans may often be able to make more accurate ratings using comparative measures. We also recommend an agenda for greater exploitation and understanding of relative judgments in psychological research and practice.",6,1,48,60,Social perception; Social cognitive theory; Psychology; Psychometrics; Job performance; Psychological research; Personality psychology; Social psychology; Social cognition; Evolutionary psychology,attitude measurement; evolutionary psychology; person perception; personnel evaluation; social judgments,,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1745691610393521 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26162115/ http://pps.sagepub.com/content/6/1/48.abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26162115 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1745691610393521,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1745691610393521,26162115,10.1177/1745691610393521,2018532708,,0,001-566-923-115-72X; 002-353-703-152-390; 002-464-912-971-175; 002-630-932-176-671; 005-008-302-661-938; 005-310-022-514-957; 005-831-651-908-071; 007-084-527-581-370; 007-941-335-223-177; 011-708-038-952-596; 013-959-264-084-554; 017-474-498-443-871; 017-525-492-132-64X; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-696-840-914-301; 022-042-817-846-46X; 022-668-018-572-903; 026-387-449-478-155; 029-022-042-825-300; 029-256-226-451-157; 029-621-304-327-614; 033-741-161-655-899; 035-537-518-448-791; 038-941-511-908-672; 040-256-856-971-059; 049-494-674-809-588; 052-882-540-422-284; 054-144-109-038-531; 059-465-807-605-555; 060-560-582-038-713; 060-567-604-900-557; 062-447-030-980-207; 063-956-106-105-022; 065-479-080-820-020; 066-340-448-179-498; 072-399-985-889-130; 077-564-742-926-337; 080-352-765-956-858; 080-506-380-749-822; 082-340-378-801-412; 082-875-356-831-38X; 084-672-021-220-248; 088-589-028-583-453; 103-808-516-623-433; 111-251-396-018-857; 116-395-677-539-389; 116-545-026-621-099; 125-164-529-763-707; 130-635-768-195-97X; 132-228-273-659-933; 134-287-809-759-215; 140-397-553-301-28X; 145-728-008-645-576; 146-951-314-180-066; 149-532-315-277-006; 155-000-643-993-781; 155-365-316-381-974; 156-695-224-836-175; 159-439-622-382-03X; 168-102-460-634-312; 170-158-318-409-40X; 172-572-166-912-802; 176-672-257-066-596; 179-761-027-549-465; 181-166-614-027-51X; 181-196-168-858-467; 186-086-643-200-846,59

Morrow,"Norbert Elias (1897-1990) has been recog nized belatedly in American sociology, even though the prefaces to his collected works claim he was ""one of the great sociologists of our time"". This more British and European judgment-Elias won the first versions of both the Theodor Adorno Award (1977) and the European Amali Prize for social science (1987)-would generally come as a surprise for American sociologists. Indeed, if sociol ogy were a sport, Elias would win the ""come back of the century award"" (Gordon 2002: 68). Yet as Edward Shils once pointed out, the ""success"" and visibility of sociological ideas have only a weak relationship to their enduring validity. Shils' case in point, writ ing in 1970, was that whereas Frankfurt School Critical Theory had become popular primarily because of its politics and strategic ""ecological"" location, Karl Mannheim's soci ology had been unjustly marginalized despite its greater sociological depth (Shils 1980). Despite the tendentiousness of his comparative judgments, Shils' sociological argument about the marginalizing effects of ecological locations could be applied even more tellingly to Elias, Mannheim's onetime assistant. Ironically, however, from the per spective of critical social theory all three of these cases can now be viewed in a very dif ferent political context as more complemen tary than competing, sharing a historicist, post-empiricist conception of social theory whose post-Kantian interpretive structural ism could not be comprehended within the categories of logical empiricism and posi tivism. Following a doctorate on Kant in philoso phy, Elias became a sociology student of Alfred Weber (Max's younger brother) in Heidelberg in 1925 for his Habilitation research (necessary for a teaching position). There he also met and befriended Mannheim, becoming his assistant when he left in 1930 for a chair in Frankfurt. Though only 4 years younger than Mannheim, he had lost considerable career time because of trau matic World War I military duty and post war family economic problems. In contrast to Mannheim, however, Elias lived a long-as Early Writings, by Norbert Elias. The Collected Works of Norbert Elias, Volume 1, edited by Richard Kilminster. Translated by Edmund Jephcott.

R Dulange; Ashok K. Pundir; L. Ganapathy,"The purpose of this paper is to identify the critical success factors influencing the performance of power loom textiles, to evaluate their impact on the organizational performance and to find out the effect of these factors on the organizational performance of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the Solapur (Maharashtra) industrial sector using AHP. In the methodology adopted, factors are identified through the literature survey and finalization of these factors is done by taking the opinion of experts in the Indian context. By cognitive map, the relation between these factors (direct and indirect effect) is determined and cause and effect diagram is prepared. Then these factors are arranged hierarchically and tree diagram is prepared. A questionnaire was designed and distributed among the experts; data is collected. Using expert choice software data is filled to quantify by pair-wise comparison of these factors and are prioritized. The weights demonstrate several key findings: local and global priority reveals that there is a substantial effect of the human resource, product style, and volume on the organizational performance. The skills and technology upgradation impact on organizational performance. Maintenance plays an important role in improving the organizational performances of the SMEs. Overall, the results showed the central role of the operational factors are important. The research is subject to the normal limitations of AHP. The study is using perceptual data provided by Experts which may not provide clear measures of impact factors. However, this can be overcome using more experts to collect data in future studies. Interestingly, the findings here may be generalisable outside Solapur like Ichalkarnji, Malegaon, and Bhiwadi (Maharashtra). Solapur power loom SMEs should consider AHP as an innovative tool for quantification of factors impacting on performance and improving operational and organizational performance in today’s dynamic manufacturing environment. The finding suggests the notion that these critical success factors (CSFs) are to be studied carefully and improvement strategy should be developed. Moreover, the study emphasizes the need to link priority of factors to organizational performance and improvement. The study integrates the CSFs of performance and its quantification using AHP and its effect on performance of power loom textiles. The indirect impacts of underlying and fundamental factors are considered. Very few studies have been performed to investigate and understand this issue. Therefore, the research can make a useful contribution.",10,4,217,227,Human resources; Organizational performance; Critical success factor; Process management; Literature survey; Computer science; Operations research; Ishikawa diagram; Tree diagram; Power loom; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/34972015/prioritization-of-factors-impacting-on-performance-of-power-looms-using-ahp https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40092-014-0080-8 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40092-014-0080-8.pdf https://www.iiste.org/Journals/index.php/IEL/article/viewFile/10901/11204 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014JIEI...10..217D/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/93361789.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40092-014-0080-8,,10.1007/s40092-014-0080-8,1976065332,,0,002-755-798-986-022; 004-079-156-606-675; 007-017-066-055-393; 008-874-428-789-996; 009-583-762-961-399; 015-727-453-798-88X; 018-018-048-677-635; 020-385-986-563-999; 021-481-390-066-488; 023-452-094-856-274; 025-746-447-620-627; 025-923-213-645-762; 029-919-837-692-341; 030-009-182-777-709; 030-468-059-473-761; 030-800-118-065-98X; 031-630-659-521-631; 033-845-590-726-444; 035-052-750-385-064; 035-596-703-883-613; 036-784-682-767-502; 038-167-781-806-609; 038-523-104-433-065; 040-276-412-674-609; 041-171-350-981-640; 056-192-906-007-948; 060-565-401-337-240; 070-094-163-468-070; 080-725-793-518-635; 084-084-914-644-717; 099-722-312-214-70X; 104-792-204-771-149; 110-459-610-347-050; 116-322-499-541-12X; 135-550-832-980-85X; 136-423-823-462-22X; 145-355-889-376-580; 155-987-132-917-830; 168-339-149-458-227; 169-164-558-179-143; 169-455-811-601-118; 170-987-579-156-787; 179-647-682-910-254; 184-367-351-019-672,3

George Hutchinson,"Abstract While the repeated nature of discrete choice experiments is advantageous from a sampling efficiency perspective, patterns of choice may differ across the tasks, due, in part, to learning and fatigue. Using probabilistic decision process models, we find in a field study that learning and fatigue behavior may only be exhibited by a small subset of respondents.

This is not to be preferred in light of public accountability and cost-effectiveness. It is unknown to what extent each decision criterion is appreciated by decision-makers. Further insight into this relative importance improves understanding of decision-making of sewer system managers. As such, a digital questionnaire (response ratio 43%), containing pairwise comparisons between 10 relevant information sources, was sent to all 407 municipalities in the Netherlands to analyse the relative importance and assess whether a shared frame of reasoning is present. Thurstone's law of comparative judgment was used for analysis, combined with several consistency tests. Results show that camera inspections were valued highest, while pipe age was considered least important. The respondents were pretty consistent per individual and also showed consistency as a group. This indicated a common framework of reasoning among the group. The feedback of the group showed, however, the respondents found it difficult to make general comparisons without having a context.

030-805-493-219-795,Effects of corporate social responsibility and irresponsibility policies,,2013,journal article,Journal of Business Research,01482963,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,J. Scott Armstrong; Kesten C. Green,"Abstract This article reviews experimental evidence on the effects of policies intended to promote behavior by firms that is more socially responsible and less socially irresponsible. Corporate social responsibility (CSR) can provide firms with opportunities for profit, but changes are likely to increase total welfare only if firms adopt them freely and without taxpayer subsidies. Mandated CSR circumvents people's own plans and preferences, distorts the allocation of resources, and increases the likelihood of irresponsible decisions. Evidence that government policies will increase welfare and a compelling argument that proven benefits outweigh reductions in freedom are necessary in order to justify CSR mandates. To date, this has apparently not been achieved. Corporate social irresponsibility (CSI) is concerned with whether firms undertake harmful actions that managers would be unwilling to undertake acting for themselves, or that a reasonable person would expect to cause substantive net harm when all parties are considered. Markets in which stakeholders are free to make decisions in their own interests provide some protection against CSI. Tort and contract law provide additional protection. Nevertheless, managers sometimes act irresponsibly. Codes of ethics that require fair treatment of stakeholders while pursuing long-term profit can reduce the risk of irresponsible decisions. Management support and stakeholder accounting are important for successful implementation. Firms may wish to consider these measures; many already have.",66,10,1922,1927,Public economics; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Social responsibility; Stakeholder theory; Tort; Principal–agent problem; Stakeholder; Accountability; Taxpayer,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jbrese/v66y2013i10p1922-1927.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jbrese:v:66:y:2013:i:10:p:1922-1927 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0148296313000386 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/ https://repository.upenn.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1347&context=marketing_papers https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/43007/1/MPRA_paper_43007.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0148296313000386#! https://repository.upenn.edu/marketing_papers/345/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12034766.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.014,,10.1016/j.jbusres.2013.02.014,3122619981,,0,002-092-942-082-999; 009-157-489-949-185; 009-575-398-666-624; 011-431-967-659-846; 013-151-869-558-044; 028-358-749-840-291; 029-812-156-592-353; 030-159-505-970-284; 031-818-056-018-011; 044-516-491-738-230; 044-696-166-100-971; 051-875-265-995-253; 056-531-093-539-886; 057-291-036-695-010; 060-472-626-081-132; 061-567-849-073-250; 063-440-015-049-822; 073-758-772-407-335; 079-824-881-732-648; 080-060-895-359-096; 081-908-681-586-519; 085-035-167-229-661; 090-036-788-999-277; 109-059-163-872-276; 113-170-964-858-220; 120-409-237-833-102; 130-619-709-204-709; 133-915-737-218-898; 136-596-802-946-554; 137-938-240-725-373; 143-412-560-830-261; 151-554-218-962-65X; 154-574-084-543-552; 155-879-175-881-390; 160-582-520-059-52X; 184-178-561-293-28X; 184-614-499-610-00X; 189-705-105-340-381,68

However, even the above mentioned strategies have been object of studies during childhood, little is known about how finger-counting could interact with the semantic representation of numbers in adulthood. To address this issue, we conducted a first experiment in which participants had to identify Arabic digits by pressing the keyboard with one between their ten fingers. Results showed that responses were faster and more accurate when the finger assigned to each digit was congruent with the finger-counting habits of the participants (Di Luca, Grana, Semenza, Seron and Pesenti, 2006). Subsequently, in a numerosity detection task, we showed that the numerosities expressed by canonical configurations are named faster than those expressed by non-canonical ones, even when no motors responses were needed (Di Luca and Pesenti, in press). Moreover, when used as unconsciously presented primes, both types of configurations speeded up comparative judgments of Arabic digits, but only the priming effect induced by canonical configurations generalized to new, never consciously seen, numerosities, which implies an automatic semantic access for these one only. Finally, we showed that these differences cannot be ascribed to simple visual features, but they stem from two distinct semantic processes. Specifically, canonical configurations are processed as a symbolic system and activate a place coding semantic representation of magnitude, whereas non-canonical configurations activate a summation coding semantic representation.",,,,,Congruence (geometry); Numerosity adaptation effect; Coding (social sciences); Numeral system; Symbolic system; Computer science; Priming (psychology); Arabic numerals; Arithmetic; Numerical digit,,,,,https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:12688,https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:12688,,,1726910189,,0,,0

This quality framework is meant to evaluate the perceptual impact of a compression algorithm or an error prone communication channel on the quality of an image. The image might go through various enhancement or compression algorithms, resulting in a different -- but not necessarily worse -- image. In other words, we will measure quality but not fidelity to the original picture.While modern colour appearance models are able to predict the perception of colourfulness of simple patches on uniform backgrounds, there is no agreement on how to measure the overall colourfulness of a picture of a natural scene. We try to quantify the colourfulness in natural images to perceptually qualify the effect that processing or coding has on colour. We set up a psychophysical category scaling experiment, and ask people to rate images using 7 categories of colourfulness. We then fit a metric to the results, and obtain a correlation of over 90% with the experimental data. The metric is meant to be used real time on video streams.

Some of these refugees do not receive asylum, but are not deported. Instead they are detained, or denied basic rights of residency, some forced into enclosed camps. Hoping to escape such conditions, they wish to return to unsafe countries, and ask for help from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In such cases, should NGOs and the UN assist refugees to return? Drawing on original data gathered in South Sudan, and existing data from around the world, I argue that they should assist with return if certain conditions are met. First, the UN and NGOs must try to put an end to coercive conditions before helping with return. Secondly, helping with return must not encourage the government to expand the use of coercive policies to encourage more to return. Finally, NGOs and the UN must ensure that refugees are fully informed of the risks of returning. Organizations must either conduct research in countries of origin or lobby the government to allow refugees to visit their countries of origin before making a final decision.</jats:p>",48,4,855,875,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42486589.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0007123416000193,,10.1017/s0007123416000193,,,0,000-798-385-117-248; 004-781-226-840-724; 008-057-282-387-504; 011-790-731-634-460; 021-683-127-575-109; 024-713-857-387-349; 026-834-398-620-626; 028-006-316-891-625; 032-999-523-276-311; 041-032-922-957-575; 041-872-597-716-488; 051-587-316-836-353; 056-597-268-405-233; 061-420-412-232-865; 062-648-039-871-032; 070-746-075-270-815; 071-185-701-013-576; 075-494-006-059-657; 078-316-958-840-27X; 083-879-198-869-984; 084-887-749-688-319; 087-674-981-111-995; 089-723-940-688-019; 089-846-844-967-894; 094-408-345-428-07X; 101-020-158-731-648; 103-914-554-428-902; 112-105-892-050-603; 112-378-803-995-829; 117-582-815-801-307; 136-390-536-763-507; 140-103-158-028-862; 148-425-181-710-045; 159-419-297-422-289; 165-028-152-386-001; 181-663-620-816-678,4

Similarly, several contributions have reported that measures of schizotypy in the healthy population may be related to signs of right-sided lateralization, but most of these studies differ greatly in methodology (sample size, choice of schizotypy scales and laterality tasks) and, consequently, the results cannot be compared and so definitive conclusion cannot be drawn. In this study, our purpose is to investigate whether some tasks of spatial attention may be related to different dimensions of schizotypy not only in a larger sample of healthy subjects (HS), but testing the same people with several supposedly related measures several times. Materials and Methods In the first part of the study (Part I), the performance on “paper and pencil” line bisection (LB) tasks in 205 HS was investigated. Each task was repeated three times. In the second part of the study (Part II), a subgroup of 80 subjects performed a computerized version of the LB test and of the mental number line bisection (MNL) test. In both parts of the study, every subject completed the 74-item version of the Schizotypal Personality Questionnaire (SPQ) and the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (EHI). Results In both parts of the study, high scores on the subscale ""magical thinking"" of SPQ have resulted in being closely linked to a decreased pseudoneglect as assessed by the LB task. On the contrary, right handedness is related to an increased leftward bias at the same task. No association was found between MNL and the other variables. Discussion The main finding of this study is that a decreased spatial leftward bias at the LB task correlates with positive schizotypy in the healthy population. This finding supports the hypothesis that a deviation from leftward hemispatial visual preference may be related to the degree of psychosis-like schizotypal signs in non-clini",4,,846,846,Chirality (physics); Sample size determination; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Laterality; Schizotypy; First-degree relatives; Bisection; Audiology; Schizophrenia; Lateralization of brain function,line bisection; mental number line; pseudoneglect; psychosis; schizotypy,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Giorgio_Di_Lorenzo/publication/259111738_Negative_correlation_between_leftward_bias_in_line_bisection_and_schizotypal_features_in_healthy_subjects/links/00463530286ae331ac000000.pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00846/full http://core.ac.uk/display/25944107 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/negative-correlation-between-leftward-bias-in-line-bisection-and- https://art.torvergata.it/handle/2108/99229 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00846/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24294208 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24294208/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3827540 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82882121.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00846,24294208,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00846,2135044945,PMC3827540,0,000-269-713-163-662; 000-803-327-780-07X; 001-269-190-681-722; 002-291-847-327-603; 002-663-555-629-241; 003-412-226-092-084; 003-926-956-340-439; 004-328-390-398-258; 008-249-714-909-844; 008-520-902-621-907; 008-717-077-604-232; 008-861-563-264-698; 009-684-654-041-483; 009-831-411-063-423; 010-223-018-762-11X; 010-844-024-859-980; 011-138-718-373-799; 011-312-585-397-869; 011-632-794-589-106; 012-470-096-927-427; 012-939-781-646-784; 013-689-337-508-278; 013-873-554-094-518; 013-982-085-698-011; 014-705-860-934-478; 015-057-183-522-380; 015-230-875-787-466; 015-882-949-708-585; 015-889-093-578-278; 016-283-239-555-723; 016-406-186-647-911; 016-995-905-055-612; 017-420-709-616-928; 020-716-863-452-950; 021-623-157-378-304; 022-391-229-402-243; 023-291-519-695-740; 023-514-399-639-597; 025-703-242-789-971; 026-170-847-438-178; 027-388-805-831-420; 027-736-632-167-08X; 028-494-824-060-727; 029-908-740-660-737; 030-665-044-131-315; 031-354-602-275-988; 032-140-053-579-112; 032-342-078-398-92X; 033-956-335-913-623; 034-861-457-620-321; 037-475-534-039-578; 037-916-501-037-534; 039-082-579-578-298; 040-679-428-955-620; 040-994-998-947-841; 044-112-654-190-062; 044-441-297-176-445; 048-880-286-254-890; 049-871-083-288-603; 050-565-227-903-223; 052-074-743-601-682; 052-114-250-256-124; 052-526-246-648-054; 055-751-914-818-355; 057-286-252-993-980; 058-395-540-263-017; 064-089-999-793-670; 066-533-068-191-963; 066-608-905-207-154; 071-259-655-665-424; 071-547-340-996-479; 073-661-345-336-949; 074-819-014-930-568; 077-208-818-419-892; 078-002-046-919-856; 078-134-261-820-757; 078-419-256-621-381; 079-868-710-530-712; 084-828-371-389-877; 086-027-766-461-637; 089-616-131-949-676; 089-927-020-407-987; 090-455-844-890-038; 095-875-584-616-886; 097-784-598-452-607; 098-259-636-645-196; 100-320-434-842-271; 101-181-439-463-552; 101-659-544-706-907; 102-523-523-566-574; 102-998-830-902-397; 104-814-889-113-863; 105-433-720-062-009; 105-517-243-887-97X; 106-276-816-200-859; 107-049-950-391-920; 120-843-549-455-384; 123-038-049-052-447; 124-163-231-248-664; 124-711-792-134-514; 137-663-828-634-376; 137-714-074-911-433; 142-391-841-278-93X; 144-805-992-563-703; 148-525-957-929-529; 149-270-014-602-883; 149-339-791-910-103; 151-246-612-567-055; 155-141-385-066-22X; 175-996-989-458-960; 176-715-684-971-424,3

In this article, we show that no current theory ofmass-count semantics can capture these two facts and argue for analternative theory that can. We propose that lexical roots are notspecified as mass or count. Rather, a root becomes a mass noun or countnoun by combining with a functional head. Some roots have denotations withindividuals while others do not. The count head is interpreted as afunction that maps denotations without individuals to those withindividuals. The mass head is interpreted as an identity function makingthe interpretation of a mass noun equivalent to the interpretation of theroot. As a result, all count nouns have individuals in their denotation,whereas mass counterparts of count nouns do not. Also, some roots that haveindividuals in their denotations can be used as mass nouns to denoteindividuals.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ktx59,,10.31234/osf.io/ktx59,,,0,,0
031-304-122-597-288,How to diagnose democratic deficits in global politics: the use of the ‘all-affected principle’,2017-04-05,2017,journal article,International Theory,17529719; 17529727,Cambridge University Press (CUP),United Kingdom,Mathias Koenig-Archibugi,"Is there a “democratic deficit” in global politics? If so, which changes in institutions and practices can mitigate it? Empirically oriented scholars who ask such questions often use as a yardstick the normative principle that people significantly affected by a decision should be able to take part in reaching that decision. This “all affected principle” is also endorsed by prominent political theorists. However, its most logically consistent interpretation seems so demanding that it casts doubt on the principle’s usefulness to guide the assessment of real-world situations, since it appears to require that virtually everyone in the world should have a say on any proposal or any proposal for proposals. The argument presented here intends to rescue the principle as a tool for empirical assessments of real-world situations by stressing its role in comparative judgements and especially by showing that its implications are not too expansive and/or indeterminate, once we take into account that certain types of prior decisions significantly restrict the agenda of other decisions in a systematic way. The theoretical guidance for empirical research offered in the first part of the article is then illustrated with an application to global child labor policies.",9,2,171,202,Positive economics; Empirical research; Sociology; Law; Global governance; Democratic deficit; restrict; Normative; Global politics; Democracy; Politics,,,,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68641/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-theory/article/how-to-diagnose-democratic-deficits-in-global-politics-the-use-of-the-allaffected-principle/70B31B3041273EEC35CBC3087B1DED0E https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77615241.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1752971916000312,,10.1017/s1752971916000312,2587615478,,0,000-377-433-647-687; 001-037-644-594-744; 003-763-800-545-223; 008-624-319-748-069; 010-382-032-415-462; 011-922-492-451-959; 015-295-902-438-729; 015-512-428-004-891; 015-726-543-289-101; 017-091-820-778-832; 019-972-458-677-993; 021-640-941-453-878; 024-025-349-415-906; 029-270-986-463-32X; 030-286-552-306-433; 031-552-386-486-090; 031-869-268-109-345; 032-339-283-554-891; 038-059-348-935-436; 040-510-823-368-430; 041-944-562-250-120; 045-062-600-450-838; 048-941-440-430-001; 050-583-713-086-563; 055-661-471-393-407; 058-418-839-835-226; 059-228-181-534-070; 060-302-954-904-087; 061-042-205-542-54X; 065-621-298-827-190; 067-858-238-034-39X; 070-061-271-729-185; 070-384-346-108-129; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-295-729-156-396; 072-673-673-878-677; 073-676-954-587-817; 074-486-667-083-391; 074-651-377-292-837; 074-934-022-453-400; 077-121-151-064-947; 077-336-288-229-704; 077-558-325-268-846; 078-583-525-582-785; 078-717-187-086-05X; 078-876-415-835-891; 079-870-177-530-644; 081-093-023-073-776; 081-219-715-793-011; 084-053-345-994-79X; 089-883-878-301-479; 093-905-749-742-699; 093-959-056-884-540; 096-268-921-993-407; 097-733-016-817-777; 100-101-751-567-47X; 100-453-399-301-080; 101-726-319-189-111; 105-617-887-162-075; 110-690-929-169-868; 111-374-479-811-973; 115-545-817-148-983; 115-747-284-384-11X; 116-646-983-776-423; 119-932-554-530-405; 123-660-730-843-434; 123-809-751-896-984; 125-508-710-720-919; 126-374-559-808-461; 127-110-388-818-514; 127-221-699-644-293; 127-354-078-751-570; 127-605-345-562-541; 129-171-629-586-585; 132-246-113-722-525; 136-777-514-856-397; 138-577-513-494-968; 143-190-553-105-992; 144-352-344-076-430; 144-548-497-830-224; 145-461-207-390-705; 150-469-352-085-755; 154-642-333-826-10X; 159-851-067-853-131; 160-874-392-927-162; 162-403-633-000-387; 165-350-037-132-642; 169-021-092-759-104; 175-399-447-510-976; 184-679-309-048-077; 186-503-896-179-04X; 186-979-614-689-169; 187-804-272-532-859; 191-431-238-430-723; 197-331-806-292-016,11

The linear schema view holds that there is a strong tendency in memory to organize an array of transitively related elements into a unidimensional order. The hierarchical structure view maintains that the transitively related elements are organized in memory in a hierarchy of items. I proposed an input structure and retrieval compatibility hypothesis as a coherent explanation for the contradictory views on the memory organization of serial elements. I argue that the organization of linear order information in memory is determined by the nature of the memory retrieval task used. For example, a comparative judgment task is more compatible with a unidimensional structure, whereas a sequential recall or serial position identification task is more compatible with a hierarchical organization. The input structure and retrieval compatibility concept can also explain why dichotomous categories imposed on a linear order play very little role in comparative judgments.",118,4,525,565,Recall; Serial position effect; Psychology; Schema (psychology); Memory organisation; Memoria; Hierarchical organization; Hierarchy; Communication; Categorical variable; Theoretical computer science,,Analysis of Variance; Cognitive Science; Humans; Judgment; Memory; Mental Recall; Psychological Theory; Reaction Time; Serial Learning,,PHS HHS (516365) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16402745,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16402745,16402745,,2398274932,,0,000-691-761-942-832; 004-709-019-502-865; 007-535-428-436-768; 007-547-811-399-312; 007-705-471-549-310; 012-166-793-357-304; 012-883-006-918-347; 013-913-789-186-066; 013-955-976-122-303; 019-500-364-885-841; 019-769-973-806-16X; 019-936-325-049-995; 020-391-598-463-348; 021-232-224-350-216; 021-603-607-866-826; 023-121-589-521-859; 025-225-372-308-431; 027-536-824-003-382; 030-025-420-771-477; 034-230-007-315-740; 036-064-104-461-266; 037-379-498-186-385; 038-448-987-314-707; 046-704-584-908-041; 047-116-933-879-118; 047-307-703-570-977; 049-219-036-575-071; 050-658-840-600-100; 052-393-710-318-774; 055-132-086-156-743; 058-571-827-675-115; 064-004-764-377-896; 069-912-468-484-895; 071-370-490-281-160; 071-487-053-612-186; 072-028-777-560-506; 073-126-510-872-864; 076-182-385-950-215; 077-811-568-443-545; 084-277-600-615-738; 084-998-776-516-514; 089-789-025-857-271; 094-087-384-386-015; 094-517-447-463-549; 102-775-852-540-595; 106-796-540-414-010; 107-183-317-102-326; 109-981-537-058-776; 112-408-899-976-116; 113-665-629-315-16X; 116-146-035-021-855; 118-738-628-718-086; 124-257-870-583-335; 128-327-492-428-122; 128-337-748-163-738; 133-798-350-488-105; 141-979-825-588-816; 148-214-528-359-814; 151-695-231-145-16X; 154-926-021-353-934; 156-762-273-363-770; 168-240-237-531-64X; 174-161-615-283-746; 176-017-510-665-867; 177-226-574-421-404,3

To improve pre-dictions, factors that bias memory need tobe taken into account and corrected. If,instead, bias in prediction is attributed toan optimistic outlook, then people will beunlikely to identify and correct the truecauses of their bias.

The objectives of the qualitative evaluation were to assess the enablers and barriers to usage, and to assess the impact of the service on patient care.; ; ; ; Methods:  Telephone interviews (n = 65) and a questionnaire survey (n = 296) were conducted with various types of user, in various Trust settings. Some non-users were also contacted. Selection of interviewees and questionnaire recipients was not random, and aimed to cover all groups of users representatively.; ; ; ; Results:  Results show that policy goals were being delivered, with indications of changes to clinical practice, and improved clinical governance. Promotion, training and support needs to be extensive, and tailored to needs, but users are not always aware they need training.

The neuronal correlate of such interference was suggested to be in the parietal lobe. However, a previous study showed that such interference does not occur between numerical information and nonspatial dimensions such as luminance level (Pinel P, Piazza M, Le Bihan D, Dehaene S. 2004.

Hue and tone are dealt with in the premise part of fuzzy rules and the degree of color impressions is expressed in the consequent part. Color impressions are the basic concept known as psychological effects of colors. In this paper two pieces of subjective information are considered in order to construct the subjective model. One is the information of the absolute relationship between a color and the subjective degree of its impressions. And the other is the one about the relative relationship between colors on a subjective measure in terms of color impressions. Two kinds of questionnaires, called the absolute and the comparative judgments, are performed to get the subjective information. Additionally, this paper proposes improves the method so that is more applicable to the practical use. A validity of the proposed methods are examined by evaluation experiments. </jats:p>",9,4,551,568,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s0218213000000355,,10.1142/s0218213000000355,,,0,,1

Those studies have generally used comparative judgments as a measure to assess the point of subjective equality; however, similarity judgments have been proposed as possibly less prone to decision biases (Schneider & Komlos, 2008). In three experiments, using a similarity judgment task, we did not find any evidence of motion speed enhancement by exogenous attention. We suggest that the effect revealed by comparative judgments arises at the decisional, rather than the perceptual, stage.",72,3,637,650,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Perception,,Attention; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reaction Time; Social Perception; Young Adult,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/APP.72.3.637 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2010171591/are-the-effects-of-attention-on-speed-judgments-genuinely https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20348570 https://paperity.org/p/21155328/are-the-effects-of-attention-on-speed-judgments-genuinely-perceptual,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/app.72.3.637,20348570,10.3758/app.72.3.637,1983633838,,0,002-263-597-876-766; 003-234-688-368-621; 005-251-864-553-226; 006-813-548-190-935; 006-890-882-656-98X; 010-941-661-113-334; 011-601-854-227-368; 018-475-871-856-107; 018-902-176-159-944; 028-494-560-804-402; 031-324-485-402-628; 033-489-948-964-618; 044-433-991-525-780; 046-413-102-635-82X; 050-276-604-535-681; 051-153-997-966-867; 051-367-065-938-325; 052-602-003-829-231; 053-881-532-306-162; 054-581-153-094-317; 056-747-992-490-572; 061-493-249-815-530; 068-494-576-380-166; 070-274-883-323-660; 072-558-528-165-618; 074-190-803-868-351; 080-425-353-353-131; 082-577-039-475-937; 087-039-424-085-971; 095-761-873-843-537; 097-250-909-662-702; 102-157-239-719-37X; 114-902-585-779-941; 121-593-252-566-54X; 128-517-162-068-58X; 159-716-474-813-389; 163-307-707-970-578; 171-293-257-714-862; 187-520-189-685-825,21

This study focuses on the perceptions of pedestrians, cyclists, and motorists regarding the risk of crashes with trams. The first aim was to examine how these road users assess the risk of tram crashes with themselves and with other road users of the same age and type. The second aim was to look into whether and to what extent road users' comparative judgments about tram risk are realistic in terms of their self-reported behavior. Method The study sample included 973 road users (379 pedestrians, 146 cyclists, and 448 motorists). Three versions of a questionnaire were constructed to assess risk perceptions concerning interactions between these road users and trams, self-reported behavior, and knowledge of the tram-priority rules. Results The results showed that all three types of road users perceived the risk of a crash between a tram and themselves to be very low (M = 1.53, SD = 0.88) and with other users to be higher (M = 2.28, SD = 1.06); they therefore expressed comparative optimism. The results also revealed realistic optimism among pedestrians and unrealistic optimism among young motorists. Conclusion The present study shows that, as a whole, road users have little awareness of crash risks with trams. It may therefore be worthwhile to increase communication about the priority of trams, and to persuade road users not to violate this rule.",15,4,387,394,Risk assessment; Engineering; Risk perception; Human factors and ergonomics; Crash; Optimism; Transport engineering; Types of road; Poison control; Suicide prevention,,,,,https://www.worldtransitresearch.info/research/4422/ https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00853315 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847812000204 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847812000204 https://trid.trb.org/view/1141265,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2012.03.001,,10.1016/j.trf.2012.03.001,2022308451,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 001-575-225-357-734; 005-828-252-201-477; 006-674-798-753-238; 007-613-518-980-709; 011-155-695-681-098; 011-397-141-989-21X; 012-419-306-168-454; 016-509-402-794-767; 019-995-576-553-416; 020-266-551-321-761; 025-669-752-288-599; 026-387-449-478-155; 035-376-808-967-122; 037-453-463-014-594; 041-383-597-145-710; 041-860-680-626-354; 046-352-600-258-872; 054-163-434-118-897; 054-838-615-271-826; 057-962-355-435-544; 064-012-872-909-597; 074-331-217-488-467; 074-912-140-708-016; 078-993-211-855-99X; 081-228-381-476-95X; 084-920-102-153-251; 086-257-322-766-118; 088-869-229-566-701; 089-872-460-846-072; 100-436-172-024-424; 107-854-421-865-889; 130-650-268-245-489; 149-656-932-345-830; 160-186-740-648-241; 173-390-963-527-914,38

Stolk; Mark Oppe; Luciana Scalone; Paul F. M. Krabbe,"OBJECTIVES: Probabilistic models have been developed to establish the relative merit of subjective phenomena by means of specific judgmental tasks involving discrete choices (DCs). The attractiveness of these DC models is that they are embedded in a strong theoretical measurement framework and are based on relatively simple judgmental tasks. The aim of our study was to determine whether the values derived from a DC experiment are comparable to those obtained using other valuation techniques, in particular the time trade-off (TTO). METHODS: Two hundred nine students completed several tasks in which we collected DC, rank, visual analog scale, and TTO responses. DC data were also collected in a general population sample (N=444). The DC experiment was designed using a Bayesian approach, and involved 60 choices between two health states and a comparison of all health states to being dead. The DC data were analyzed using a conditional logit and a rank-ordered logit model, relying, respectively, on TTO values and the value for being dead to anchor the DC-derived values to the 0 to 1 quality-adjusted life-year (QALY) scale. RESULTS: Although modeled DC data broadly replicated the pattern found in TTO responses, the DC consistently produced higher values. The two methods for anchoring DC-derived values on the QALY scale produced similar results. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the high level of comparability between DC-derived values and TTO values, future valuation studies based on a combination of these two techniques may be considered. The results further suggest that DC can potentially be used as a substitute for TTO.",13,8,1005,1013,Statistics; Logit; Econometrics; Logistic regression; Discrete choice; Comparability; Bayes' theorem; Time-trade-off; EQ-5D; Mathematics; Probabilistic logic,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Bayes Theorem; Choice Behavior; Female; Health Behavior; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Quality of Life; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Young Adult",,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301511718344 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/88887 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20825618 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F86924d6f-1ea0-4632-b868-e1215548b08d https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/discrete-choice-modeling-for-the-quantification-of-health-states(86924d6f-1ea0-4632-b868-e1215548b08d).html http://core.ac.uk/display/16173349 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00783.x/abstract https://repub.eur.nl/pub/21602 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20825618 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301511718344 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82114221.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00783.x,20825618,10.1111/j.1524-4733.2010.00783.x,2155224812,,0,000-113-741-381-180; 007-484-909-003-94X; 008-232-855-984-206; 009-173-701-938-871; 009-577-577-067-749; 010-743-035-974-99X; 011-147-007-763-664; 013-207-306-538-744; 017-422-516-426-553; 023-919-696-772-760; 033-058-621-457-935; 033-172-725-147-949; 035-252-253-486-071; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-841-468-209-106; 041-141-612-502-359; 042-262-850-601-237; 045-277-151-976-68X; 062-783-280-287-096; 063-863-517-456-537; 067-368-098-474-497; 070-022-364-335-159; 072-231-542-835-88X; 077-145-255-358-874; 077-467-148-718-776; 085-138-376-626-614; 098-583-005-710-291; 100-660-177-576-507; 103-301-031-992-422; 105-031-973-581-817; 115-267-489-063-51X; 118-020-403-059-275; 120-182-063-810-977; 128-315-979-589-27X; 129-987-310-974-174; 137-985-907-570-544; 138-718-729-855-212; 144-865-091-737-280; 164-260-106-908-120; 178-452-162-913-148,99

An initial competence framework extracted from the existing literature was decomposed into a hierarchical structure for analytic hierarchy process (AHP) analysis. AHP through pairwise comparisons by 11 experts was utilized to determine weight values of competences pertaining to the development of a content-based English-medium educational program for international MICE professionals. The overall prioritization of competences solicited by AHP provided practical and research implications for prioritizing training needs with consideration to contextually-specific factors of a different setting under investigation.,15,,34,49,Competence (human resources); Pairwise comparison; Pedagogy; Intercultural competence; Educational program; Communicative competence; English for specific purposes; Competence model; Computer science; Knowledge management; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,National Science Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/82578823 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/412325 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473837614000124 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1473837614000124 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82578823.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jhlste.2014.04.001,,10.1016/j.jhlste.2014.04.001,1966541572,,0,001-513-495-370-150; 002-635-763-688-977; 002-695-399-983-72X; 003-448-683-979-830; 004-108-513-926-184; 004-737-077-146-924; 005-418-218-668-602; 005-760-543-822-03X; 006-061-973-365-901; 007-756-132-817-122; 008-356-842-318-372; 008-991-568-613-258; 010-207-572-331-990; 010-553-331-778-240; 011-527-827-737-132; 012-312-433-924-785; 014-027-299-036-161; 016-027-335-594-009; 018-787-568-918-259; 020-009-668-223-965; 020-931-407-596-020; 022-072-729-957-036; 022-750-888-655-246; 024-939-629-498-882; 026-101-943-669-604; 026-103-828-236-239; 026-540-705-725-169; 027-776-489-957-631; 028-454-054-636-147; 028-801-995-271-315; 029-846-575-358-794; 032-495-499-582-351; 033-009-237-934-628; 033-009-700-255-644; 033-370-187-577-614; 034-223-665-179-431; 034-763-096-886-749; 034-851-446-934-457; 036-773-839-831-311; 039-872-566-277-206; 042-918-245-419-161; 045-044-588-010-071; 045-652-684-257-372; 049-816-920-118-731; 050-364-922-014-443; 051-287-394-674-009; 051-454-615-781-875; 051-507-248-256-038; 052-840-587-628-700; 054-207-936-432-570; 054-515-531-416-235; 055-112-357-210-003; 056-051-145-350-469; 057-596-544-949-037; 065-317-286-637-211; 065-706-440-859-664; 065-860-266-171-906; 067-380-387-726-082; 069-099-255-726-302; 072-820-893-887-943; 072-847-114-700-116; 074-342-848-743-384; 075-486-648-220-609; 080-206-582-269-822; 080-631-860-960-486; 081-738-992-823-500; 084-743-242-989-70X; 085-154-892-102-307; 085-544-716-870-968; 089-217-238-712-89X; 089-735-215-419-674; 090-487-798-060-688; 093-754-224-241-028; 094-292-053-335-734; 096-135-179-288-375; 098-249-957-225-572; 098-470-933-854-545; 099-245-429-796-88X; 099-780-895-442-987; 112-458-063-124-154; 116-557-622-355-039; 119-056-506-829-27X; 119-491-509-975-033; 122-261-506-995-826; 125-321-672-784-849; 134-659-460-844-146; 135-758-328-994-008; 141-520-817-482-06X; 144-226-177-958-841; 145-555-660-938-393; 148-282-867-989-903; 148-747-622-937-58X; 151-223-261-639-536; 151-495-456-415-523; 151-932-745-917-178; 156-826-128-520-821; 158-896-899-037-746; 162-989-491-707-088; 165-303-115-459-631; 171-982-737-135-580; 176-079-167-876-926; 179-430-900-699-382; 197-952-817-307-035,17

In keeping with the government’s rhetoric of evidence-based policy, a plethora of different research reports on specific youth sport initiatives were commissioned. The purpose of this study was to synthesise relevant reports to better understand the implementation of Labour’s youth sport policies and to consider the extent to which insights drawn from these reports could extend understanding of effective approaches to improving young people’s participation in sport and physical activity. Inspired by a ‘realist synthesis’ approach, the research methodology focused attention towards the mechanisms, contexts and outcomes of youth sport initiatives.

To ensure standards are kept ‘constant’ is essentially a process of comparison rather than measurement. In this chapter four examples are presented to show how Thurstone’s method of comparative judgement can be used to maintain standards, especially in the more ‘difficult’ cases involving extended writing, performances, or other complex activities. In particular, it describes how analysis of the residuals from fitting Rasch parameters to the data can be used to monitor the quality of the equating procedure.",,,279,298,Rasch model; Equating; Mathematics education; Thurstone scale; Judgement; Professional judgement; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-50856-6_16,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-50856-6_16,,10.1007/978-3-319-50856-6_16,2592076467,,0,013-941-623-206-969; 021-707-061-329-872; 033-072-283-451-880; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 058-357-262-233-370; 062-546-879-061-051; 098-950-277-295-601; 102-955-514-174-383,0

In the method of paired comparisons, objects are presented in pairs to the judges. The Bradley-Terry model for paired comparisons is considered for Bayesian analysis. The prior distribution for the parameters of the model is supposed to be belonged to the member of the Dirichlet family and the method for elicitation of hyperparameters is based on the prior predictive distribution. For Bayesian analysis, the posterior distribution of the parameters is derived, the preference probabilities using the posterior means and the predictive probabilities for pairwise comparisons in a single future comparison are obtained. The posterior probabilities for the hypotheses of comparing two parameters are also computed.

Tyler; Steven L. Blader,"Previous research has shown that people's self-esteem and their group-oriented behavior are influenced by their judgments about the status of the groups to which they belong (pride) and assessments of their status within those groups (respect). These findings are important to justice researchers because the key antecedent of such status judgments is typically found to be the assessment of the fairness of group procedures (i.e., procedural justice). Research suggests that (1) procedural justice shapes status and that (2) status shapes self-esteem and group-oriented behavior. The paper reports the results of three studies comparing two different forms of these status judgments. The first form are autonomous judgments of pride and respect that are linked to the characteristics associated with membership in different groups. People link such judgments to inclusion or membership in the group. The second are comparative judgments of pride and respect that are linked to comparisons of one's status to the status of other people or groups. The results indicate that, within groups, people are influenced primarily by autonomous assessments of status based on their internal standards, which develop from the status associated with prototypical characteristics linked to inclusion in a group. People are less strongly influenced by comparisons of their status to the status of external comparison standards. Further, justice-based status inferences are shown to be primarily autonomous, and not comparative, in nature.",89,1,813,838,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Procedural justice; Pride; Social psychology,,,,,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2002-06032-002 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jobhdp/v89y2002i1p813-838.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597802000316 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jobhdp:v:89:y:2002:i:1:p:813-838 http://cess.nyu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/AutonomousComparative.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0749-5978(02)00031-6,,10.1016/s0749-5978(02)00031-6,2019162241,,0,004-131-309-943-003; 004-691-805-242-607; 005-410-868-804-93X; 005-495-093-612-996; 005-658-473-643-552; 007-349-845-017-637; 009-096-568-658-195; 010-948-752-350-839; 012-242-744-593-337; 012-290-987-213-139; 014-310-370-138-261; 014-462-580-599-210; 014-602-011-287-948; 015-933-424-186-128; 016-772-838-744-953; 017-076-317-707-986; 018-830-802-503-897; 019-303-532-604-20X; 019-387-803-539-27X; 022-529-505-818-712; 023-017-893-722-719; 025-099-539-746-843; 026-646-274-108-972; 026-878-699-329-60X; 028-427-530-911-821; 031-608-318-659-826; 033-735-592-275-934; 033-891-003-974-505; 039-226-233-360-144; 046-406-093-355-678; 046-603-927-038-39X; 047-366-757-498-878; 053-085-939-027-539; 054-599-553-082-273; 056-888-105-032-700; 058-533-037-604-649; 059-935-350-092-932; 060-052-432-545-102; 063-301-589-503-326; 066-253-934-199-819; 078-714-720-934-448; 085-438-658-499-910; 086-352-532-245-092; 090-036-839-566-739; 091-021-092-175-688; 094-112-039-690-982; 094-547-037-831-06X; 102-033-994-183-244; 108-223-231-718-031; 109-002-202-371-611; 110-167-195-442-258; 118-700-725-177-580; 120-482-784-044-736; 124-534-477-833-062; 128-508-908-670-522; 131-176-475-261-984; 131-425-700-797-326; 135-488-494-231-607; 141-599-025-163-997; 145-559-457-872-198; 151-032-881-697-815; 152-487-433-031-566; 159-465-812-137-384; 160-075-226-158-002; 162-826-918-690-056; 163-093-153-517-219; 164-163-496-288-996; 164-548-615-185-955; 170-028-228-901-34X; 173-186-997-651-51X; 178-463-503-959-675; 190-086-181-064-265; 197-741-498-967-748,195

Several reasons justify its study such as the implication on the news media quality or the possible association with people’s media consume. This paper examines the Spanish public opinion about the news media with the greatest credibility. The association with variables such as gender, age, education, media preference for news, level of news exposure, level of diversity in news media diet, and pattern of news consumption is explored. We analyzed data from a survey conducted in 2010 to a representative sample (n= 1,205) of the Spanish population. The paper concludes that the majority of the sample thinks that the television is the most credible media. However, findings depend on the individual traits of the individuals. The opinion about the most credible news media is mainly associated with education level. The association with pattern of news consumption and media preference suggests that people attribute more credibility to the media they use more often; therefore, relative credibility indicates a signal of affectivity rather than a comparative judgment about the veracity of news contents.",,,,,Advertising; Public opinion; Political science; Credibility; Spanish population; News media; Social psychology; Correlation and dependence,,,,,,,,,1508990202,,0,000-132-518-211-676; 001-732-710-527-676; 005-113-414-510-450; 011-399-487-495-195; 013-998-551-395-840; 020-987-338-625-221; 025-492-998-505-708; 025-662-120-613-048; 027-741-544-231-375; 029-241-373-559-115; 029-807-385-208-881; 030-242-276-399-703; 037-021-955-654-652; 037-853-880-895-938; 047-908-823-582-191; 055-889-634-403-608; 064-282-376-172-936; 069-918-774-649-341; 077-339-455-815-49X; 079-337-268-900-158; 083-854-569-425-434; 091-663-474-359-671; 115-193-082-686-038; 117-295-997-364-547; 120-143-378-929-17X; 135-697-793-999-932; 149-649-511-143-055; 154-195-615-227-12X; 168-037-364-725-099,0

Orth; Pavel Krŝka,"Abstract Producers of bottled wine have their products evaluated at various wine exhibitions for the purpose of receiving awards that can be displayed on the bottles. This contribution introduces an approach for retailers and producers to estimate optimal prices for wine exhibition awards. A case study has been employed in cooperation with a major Czech wine company to investigate the practical application of the method. Wine exhibition awards are found to be among the important factors affecting consumer preferences for bottled wine. A Conjoint experiment allowed for estimating the relative importance of selected wine exhibitions as award origins and for determining the partial utilities of selected awards (medals). Calculating the individual price equivalents for those awards and three selected wines enables the estimation of prices for maximum turnover. According to the approach, price equivalents and markups can be estimated based on consumer preferences.

First, all words that can be used in both mass and count syntax (e.g., rock, string, apple, water) always denote individuals when used in count syntax but never when used in mass syntax (e.g. too many rocks vs. too much rock). Second, some mass nouns denote individuals (e.g., furniture) while others do not (e.g., water). In this article, we show that no current theory of mass-count semantics can capture these two facts and argue for an alternative theory that can. We propose that lexical roots are not specified as mass or count. Rather, a root becomes a mass noun or count noun by combining with a functional head. Some roots have denotations with individuals while others do not. The count head is interpreted as a function that maps denotations without individuals to those with individuals. The mass head is interpreted as an identity function making the interpretation of a mass noun equivalent to the interpretation of the root. As a result, all count nouns have individuals in their denotation, whereas mass counterparts of count nouns do not. Also, some roots that have individuals in their denotations can be used as mass nouns to denote individuals.",26,3,217,252,Noun; Semantics; Generalization; Denotation; Count noun; Mass noun; Identity function; Mathematics; Linguistics; Syntax,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/BALTIO-33 https://core.ac.uk/display/100736247 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jsemantics/jsemantics26.html#BaleB09 https://academic.oup.com/jos/article/26/3/217/1662179 https://osf.io/skraa/#! https://doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffp003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/jos/ffp003,,10.1093/jos/ffp003,2138528053,,0,001-916-638-323-420; 004-153-754-767-340; 004-498-919-202-481; 006-953-359-522-536; 007-858-744-914-342; 012-007-995-598-140; 012-115-577-463-065; 015-853-537-323-037; 016-396-846-071-852; 018-596-850-088-664; 019-875-907-077-164; 026-241-348-242-811; 031-216-222-663-473; 032-097-184-092-899; 040-758-334-650-266; 045-097-620-646-598; 049-389-656-085-366; 051-191-838-808-973; 052-018-398-756-811; 058-258-899-449-044; 059-612-631-084-502; 062-828-219-658-202; 063-904-509-879-407; 064-435-563-334-499; 069-651-416-017-387; 075-605-310-388-745; 083-157-193-019-580; 084-637-916-451-684; 087-898-715-867-880; 093-497-459-464-555; 094-628-766-892-457; 094-898-091-730-985; 099-793-917-311-535; 101-682-214-088-494; 106-551-244-182-82X; 107-843-548-326-029; 113-182-570-670-637; 118-705-084-545-672; 122-366-971-442-769; 127-308-018-399-846; 133-682-753-618-360; 140-205-173-915-547; 148-155-305-642-930; 150-171-456-193-169; 152-766-048-327-629; 153-706-569-198-764; 158-082-141-366-041; 158-830-536-104-514; 165-262-049-800-396,89

Smith; Varun Kilaru; Mehmet Kocak; Lynn M. Almli; Kristina B. Mercer; Kerry J. Ressler; Frances A. Tylavsky; Karen N. Conneely,"Individual genotypes at specific loci can result in different patterns of DNA methylation. These methylation quantitative trait loci (meQTLs) influence methylation across extended genomic regions and may underlie direct SNP associations or gene-environment interactions. We hypothesized that the detection of meQTLs varies with ancestral population, developmental stage, and tissue type. We explored this by analyzing seven datasets that varied by ancestry (African American vs. Caucasian), developmental stage (neonate vs. adult), and tissue type (blood vs. four regions of postmortem brain) with genome-wide DNA methylation and SNP data. We tested for meQTLs by constructing linear regression models of methylation levels at each CpG site on SNP genotypes within 50 kb under an additive model controlling for multiple tests. Most meQTLs mapped to intronic regions, although a limited number appeared to occur in synonymous or nonsynonymous coding SNPs. We saw significant overlap of meQTLs between ancestral groups, developmental stages, and tissue types, with the highest rates of overlap within the four brain regions. Compared with a random group of SNPs with comparable frequencies, meQTLs were more likely to be 1) represented among the most associated SNPs in the WTCCC bipolar disorder results and 2) located in microRNA binding sites. These data give us insight into how SNPs impact gene regulation and support the notion that peripheral blood may be a reliable correlate of physiological processes in other tissues.",15,1,145,145,Genome-wide association study; SNP; Nonsynonymous substitution; Single-nucleotide polymorphism; DNA methylation; Population; Genetics; Quantitative trait locus; Locus (genetics); Biology,,"Adult; Cluster Analysis; CpG Islands; DNA Methylation; Epigenesis, Genetic; Evolution, Molecular; Female; Gene Expression Regulation; Gene-Environment Interaction; Genome-Wide Association Study; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Organ Specificity/genetics; Polymorphism, Single Nucleotide; Quantitative Trait Loci",,NICHD NIH HHS (HD055462) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH071537) United States; Howard Hughes Medical Institute United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH085806) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (HD060713) United States; NIMH NIH HHS (MH096764) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4028873 https://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-145 https://core.ac.uk/display/81919803 https://paperity.org/p/57070627/methylation-quantitative-trait-loci-meqtls-are-consistently-detected-across-ancestry https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1471-2164-15-145 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/9fe2b1eb-b94b-3e6f-9996-8320f5fb1c8f/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24555763 https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:rq3p8/ https://0-bmcgenomics-biomedcentral-com.brum.beds.ac.uk/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-15-145 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81919803.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1471-2164-15-145,24555763,10.1186/1471-2164-15-145,2016113637,PMC4028873,0,002-611-641-949-896; 003-685-712-771-49X; 005-585-375-342-460; 006-418-453-149-809; 007-813-368-228-146; 009-723-890-112-30X; 011-076-534-151-883; 012-780-067-456-48X; 014-199-595-146-366; 015-830-397-252-377; 019-263-411-041-400; 020-530-962-582-106; 020-711-413-521-995; 021-721-168-225-716; 024-534-446-715-893; 024-767-935-623-727; 026-415-504-250-889; 029-083-603-314-631; 031-542-797-624-962; 032-122-220-782-718; 035-306-129-598-317; 035-999-686-252-890; 036-240-040-224-80X; 036-801-308-114-810; 038-411-602-616-554; 043-061-763-672-569; 044-497-397-883-430; 047-910-864-296-063; 050-221-286-435-782; 052-345-635-924-304; 052-632-188-917-170; 054-438-550-995-432; 059-495-775-603-500; 059-508-099-879-228; 067-175-195-886-783; 067-485-543-518-471; 068-620-352-483-777; 076-879-997-611-003; 078-405-502-230-291; 080-252-931-183-558; 083-904-371-938-755; 089-916-464-364-670; 091-963-483-382-069; 095-756-927-287-833; 105-386-195-970-527; 107-058-859-665-489; 112-050-963-223-511; 119-250-810-947-253; 129-886-532-132-818; 137-681-546-523-001; 152-313-615-159-27X; 166-768-025-321-74X; 174-040-152-566-588; 181-160-037-797-700; 196-234-369-799-490,160

Expectations may pertain to either the features of each separate object or their simultaneous occurrence in all relevant objects. Two experiments demonstrate that inducing expectations by varying the frequency with which a component occurs, as well as the frequency with which it is shared by the compared objects, results in augmented weighting of unexpected components. Expectations can arise not only from experienced frequencies but also from an inferred set of alternatives. Features of cohesive stimuli are shown to be more expected than features of noncohesive stimuli, in the latter sense. The relatively higher weighting of distinctive features in cohesive stimuli, as well as the higher weight assigned to structurally aligned differences, could thus reflect modifications in feature expectedness. Further experiments show how task-dependent weighting interacts, with expectations to produce asymmetries between similarity and difference judgments. Finally, it is argued that changes in expectations regarding objects' attributes can explain context effects across different domains, including some types of preference reversals.",107,2,345,357,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Weighting; Context effect; Social psychology,,Cognition/physiology; Humans; Judgment; Surveys and Questionnaires,,,http://pluto.mscc.huji.ac.il/~msiritov/RitovRoleExpectations.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10789199,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0033-295x.107.2.345,10789199,10.1037/0033-295x.107.2.345,2003591531,,0,001-533-579-767-081; 005-068-413-076-373; 008-014-197-430-942; 008-463-918-023-209; 014-477-778-845-298; 021-324-283-938-712; 023-243-509-953-738; 025-877-912-695-043; 026-565-940-138-31X; 027-020-174-178-916; 028-736-000-408-347; 029-172-041-978-827; 033-434-459-390-168; 040-464-529-994-09X; 041-202-184-970-389; 043-271-342-349-398; 049-344-490-551-742; 049-724-419-560-392; 053-490-183-218-448; 056-241-449-825-475; 062-326-168-370-62X; 065-051-538-200-644; 068-978-860-714-320; 084-354-099-779-611; 090-023-370-872-145; 103-255-108-685-478; 114-164-792-099-12X; 115-614-270-678-660; 119-647-878-140-945; 133-362-129-384-449; 135-251-130-353-720; 137-186-252-095-12X; 140-090-749-158-466; 143-567-959-105-826; 166-190-539-338-866; 173-100-440-714-165; 184-410-161-919-208; 187-777-116-643-003; 190-086-181-064-265; 193-220-386-311-809,17

We identified genes that encode the proteins responsible for the precipitation and aggregation of the aragonite skeleton on which the organisms live, and revealed a network of environmental sensors that coordinate responses of the host animals to temperature, light, and pH. Furthermore, we describe a variety of stress-related pathways, including apoptotic pathways that allow the host animals to detoxify reactive oxygen and nitrogen species that are generated by their intracellular photosynthetic symbionts, and determine the fate of corals under environmental stress. Some of these genes arose through horizontal gene transfer and comprise at least 0.2% of the animal gene inventory. Our analysis elucidates the evolutionary strategies that have allowed symbiotic corals to adapt and thrive for hundreds of millions of years.",5,,,,Comparative genomics; Genome; Coral; Ecology; Genomics; Hermatypic coral; Anthozoa; Coral reef; Biology; Phylogenetics,biomineralization; corals; ecology; evolutionary biology; genomics; horizontal gene transfer; stress response; symbiosis,"Adaptation, Physiological/genetics; Animals; Anthozoa/classification; Biological Evolution; Calcification, Physiologic/genetics; Calcium Carbonate/chemistry; Coral Reefs; Gene Transfer, Horizontal; Genome; Genomics/methods; Hydrogen-Ion Concentration; Light; Metabolic Networks and Pathways/genetics; Photosynthesis/physiology; Phylogeny; Reactive Nitrogen Species/metabolism; Reactive Oxygen Species/metabolism; Stress, Physiological; Symbiosis/physiology; Temperature",Reactive Nitrogen Species; Reactive Oxygen Species; Calcium Carbonate,NIGMS NIH HHS (P20 GM103466) United States; NIMHD NIH HHS (P20 MD006084) United States; NIMHD NIH HHS (U54 MD007584) United States,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554%2FeLife.13288 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/107357 https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/50776 https://researchonline.jcu.edu.au/48388/ https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4878875 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27218454 https://academicworks.cuny.edu/bb_pubs/275/ https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/xmlui/handle/1957/59361 https://elifesciences.org/articles/13288 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/bitstream/1885/107357/1/01_Bhattacharya_Comparative_Genomics_2016.pdf https://academicworks.cuny.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1263&context=bb_pubs https://ir.library.oregonstate.edu/downloads/js956h86g https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3q90j601 https://dx.doi.org/10.7554%2FeLife.13288 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132731026.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/elife.13288,27218454,10.7554/elife.13288,2395058975,PMC4878875,0,000-180-797-000-324; 001-014-386-352-803; 001-054-922-470-376; 001-150-252-595-427; 004-114-029-179-835; 005-533-006-660-557; 005-891-753-509-172; 006-871-699-752-048; 007-392-366-703-692; 007-547-222-336-321; 007-842-333-307-664; 008-183-631-639-00X; 008-951-060-067-181; 011-616-009-472-034; 011-967-817-018-416; 012-154-065-691-20X; 013-044-664-386-61X; 013-180-958-885-162; 014-210-299-364-013; 015-797-034-816-725; 016-445-567-007-426; 016-710-375-180-202; 017-469-633-151-227; 017-631-689-502-340; 018-395-422-115-207; 018-513-711-091-445; 018-797-363-505-484; 019-966-926-913-731; 020-407-757-278-523; 020-675-192-548-979; 022-368-594-985-904; 022-373-450-023-796; 024-342-262-264-745; 025-511-449-522-012; 026-216-754-806-876; 026-664-393-760-276; 027-500-249-934-441; 027-546-346-524-798; 027-608-946-492-33X; 027-813-117-908-345; 027-839-176-036-829; 027-970-236-946-431; 028-564-131-440-867; 028-623-662-962-282; 030-536-711-949-487; 032-364-164-377-903; 032-391-416-954-310; 032-859-430-872-582; 033-786-713-572-602; 035-872-392-905-552; 036-558-996-168-865; 036-713-360-346-301; 037-378-143-177-469; 038-278-668-224-350; 038-530-229-563-360; 039-576-464-454-228; 039-584-881-552-240; 040-045-024-617-153; 040-099-737-777-353; 041-036-308-972-714; 043-664-917-589-26X; 044-779-822-758-864; 046-969-263-175-653; 048-306-352-495-996; 049-254-994-816-223; 053-926-877-225-030; 054-146-949-664-972; 055-272-372-883-567; 056-201-471-905-934; 056-976-334-518-683; 057-371-429-368-846; 058-348-552-858-155; 059-412-858-210-52X; 059-682-253-389-395; 060-451-684-695-527; 062-404-551-090-381; 062-443-471-020-000; 063-097-626-410-554; 066-779-323-981-699; 069-314-536-628-476; 069-702-173-688-107; 071-431-810-432-682; 072-517-598-674-222; 072-535-278-366-043; 074-184-190-260-819; 075-059-752-333-885; 075-732-569-838-057; 077-311-998-527-57X; 078-351-477-184-527; 079-092-826-448-758; 084-954-779-112-393; 086-330-947-514-752; 086-934-341-884-73X; 087-567-531-662-390; 088-355-583-749-641; 088-392-848-699-399; 090-863-558-925-482; 094-390-372-783-963; 096-737-052-128-057; 098-245-541-956-242; 098-801-899-277-476; 099-001-979-918-457; 100-177-686-741-910; 100-482-984-758-877; 100-825-307-201-539; 101-255-132-878-496; 103-081-737-651-089; 104-591-153-208-83X; 105-269-408-920-214; 106-528-938-812-771; 107-509-645-466-29X; 111-400-539-655-826; 115-745-486-897-619; 119-107-530-101-921; 119-286-543-233-196; 120-021-583-231-066; 121-332-933-297-482; 126-306-266-563-419; 130-250-594-066-678; 131-733-986-656-290; 138-689-931-268-943; 141-944-113-268-03X; 142-243-816-973-16X; 161-991-059-580-854; 165-454-336-330-311; 167-484-608-893-282; 169-529-014-446-29X; 171-779-538-403-622,128

Seth Bordner,"Comparative judgments abound in sports. Fans and pundits bandy about which of two players or teams is bigger, faster, stronger, more talented, less injury prone, more reliable, safer to bet on, riskier to trade for, and so on. Arguably, of most interest are judgments of a coarser type: which of two players or teams is, all-things-considered, just plain better? Conventionally, it is accepted that such comparisons can be appropriately captured and expressed by sports rankings. Rankings play an important role in sports arguably because of the conventional acceptance that rankings capture and express all-things-considered relations between the ranked teams or players. Standard ranking practices rely on a number of widely held assumptions. I discuss three of the most important and argue that at least one of them must be false.

Fleming; Matthew Manning,"In Australia, as in many other parts of the world, open access is the default policy setting for most protected natural areas, including World Heritage Sites. This is despite considerable evidence that unrestrained levels of visitation can be unsustainable in terms of the impact on the environment and recreational experience. This paper seeks to answer two questions. First, to what extent are visitors willing to forego access to publicly owned protected natural areas in order to ensure less crowding and/or better environmental outcomes? And second, if access were restricted, how would visitors like remaining access rights to be allocated? The results show that visitors are, in general, willing to trade off some degree of access rights for better environmental outcomes and reduced crowding; particularly the former. It is clear that peak pricing is not supported, whereas visitor caps have broad support.",21,5,995,1014,Recreation; Crowding; Applied economics; Economics; Marketing; Tourism; Rationing; Visitor management; Choice modelling; Visitor pattern,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.5367/te.2014.0388 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5210900 http://teu.sagepub.com/lookup/doi/10.5367/te.2014.0388 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20153397496 https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/63726 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20153397496.html http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.5367/te.2014.0388 https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/103305 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143901478.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5367/te.2014.0388,,10.5367/te.2014.0388,1952554302,,0,005-406-883-777-157; 009-640-943-837-213; 022-616-578-204-194; 022-880-424-878-113; 032-303-806-819-592; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-141-612-502-359; 053-003-647-981-062; 064-955-609-602-348; 067-789-105-462-933; 082-860-592-244-417; 087-974-888-230-206; 089-876-832-494-177; 090-738-237-848-225; 093-149-980-450-604; 095-334-267-108-974; 096-327-964-864-020; 113-592-033-096-926; 135-175-612-175-689; 146-832-021-032-068; 150-887-654-392-488,3

The design of the study also allowed a comparison of models based on raw or untransformed VAS values with values transformed at the level of the respondent and at the aggregate level.,4,1,29,29,Public economics; Econometrics; Economics; Valuation (finance); Respondent; EQ-5D; Health care management; Aggregate level; Orthogonal array; Exploratory research,,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4502078 https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13561-014-0029-z https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26208929 https://core.ac.uk/display/81915564 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-014-0029-z https://paperity.org/p/52372039/results-from-an-exploratory-study-to-test-the-performance-of-eq-5d-3l-valuation-subsets https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80046866.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13561-014-0029-z,26208929,10.1186/s13561-014-0029-z,2171641122,PMC4502078,0,007-470-484-846-951; 011-147-007-763-664; 013-225-323-906-421; 014-583-327-992-386; 020-300-477-631-169; 024-483-119-393-877; 034-475-655-028-446; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-110-611-111-858; 042-033-411-761-475; 053-713-658-650-53X; 054-658-089-684-904; 062-589-327-486-393; 094-492-417-882-170; 112-582-751-916-014; 115-267-489-063-51X; 120-080-285-932-016; 120-600-362-232-723; 131-348-799-027-658; 184-731-547-945-721,2
034-518-461-341-01X,Three Ways in Which Midline Regions Contribute to Self-Evaluation,2013-08-02,2013,journal article,Frontiers in human neuroscience,16625161,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Taru Flagan; Jennifer S. Beer,"An integration of existing research and newly-conducted psychophysiological interaction (PPI) connectivity analyses suggest a new framework for understanding the contribution of midline regions to social cognition. Recent meta-analyses suggest that there are no midline regions that are exclusively associated with self-processing. Whereas medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) is broadly modulated by self-processing, subdivisions within MPFC are differentially modulated by the evaluation of close others (ventral MPFC: BA 10/32) and the evaluation of other social targets (dorsal MPFC: BA 9/32). The role of DMPFC in social cognition may also be less uniquely social than previously thought; it may be better characterized as a region that indexes certainty about evaluation rather than previously considered social mechanisms (i.e., correction of self-projection). VMPFC, a region often described as an important mediator of socioemotional significance, may instead perform a more cognitive role by reflecting the type of information brought to bear on evaluations of people we know well. Furthermore, the new framework moves beyond MPFC and hypothesizes that two other midline regions, ventral anterior cingulate cortex (VACC: BA 25) and medial orbitofrontal cortex (MOFC: BA 11), aid motivational influences on social cognition. Despite the central role of motivation in psychological models of self-perception, neural models have largely ignored the topic. Positive connectivity between VACC and MOFC may mediate bottom-up sensitivity to information based on its potential for helping us evaluate ourselves or others the way we want. As connectivity becomes more positive with striatum and less positive with middle frontal gyrus (BA 9/44), MOFC mediates top-down motivational influences by adjusting the standards we bring to bear on evaluations of ourselves and other people.",7,,450,450,Socioemotional selectivity theory; Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognition; Orbitofrontal cortex; Psychophysiological Interaction; Anterior cingulate cortex; Middle frontal gyrus; Prefrontal cortex; Social cognition,frontal lobe; motivation; optimistic bias; person perception; self; self-projection; social cognition,,,,https://europepmc.org/article/MED/23935580 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3731671 http://core.ac.uk/display/26679232 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00450/full http://homepage.psy.utexas.edu/HomePage/Group/BeerLAB/flagan%20and%20beer%20fnhum-07-00450.pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00450/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82835032.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2013.00450,23935580,10.3389/fnhum.2013.00450,2171613096,PMC3731671,0,000-090-458-316-333; 000-125-181-498-310; 001-699-812-980-074; 002-396-921-784-425; 003-103-573-735-452; 007-778-725-444-103; 010-004-037-468-477; 011-489-994-664-968; 012-419-306-168-454; 012-869-979-535-894; 018-757-245-440-011; 020-419-379-272-121; 023-459-652-549-183; 025-431-387-793-748; 028-262-911-719-830; 028-570-819-332-021; 028-633-799-586-379; 028-702-227-659-292; 028-798-600-345-443; 030-428-139-842-604; 031-136-752-436-374; 031-672-019-523-79X; 032-134-074-082-50X; 034-520-222-312-601; 035-080-809-966-460; 039-900-956-980-496; 040-101-192-715-362; 041-127-020-287-05X; 043-630-561-204-617; 043-935-327-751-230; 046-125-420-535-318; 047-139-330-487-686; 047-975-913-480-711; 048-701-155-303-481; 050-846-070-459-195; 053-957-345-985-647; 054-031-855-085-128; 054-508-094-753-886; 055-376-995-899-991; 057-282-335-615-805; 062-022-911-967-711; 063-325-395-878-388; 064-740-565-468-977; 065-688-149-501-185; 066-255-227-146-08X; 066-773-426-238-227; 069-104-481-684-167; 070-161-938-384-022; 071-637-558-385-75X; 072-786-297-450-378; 075-224-366-403-116; 080-649-347-048-061; 082-662-120-833-072; 082-679-495-631-62X; 084-265-483-140-375; 086-711-040-036-739; 087-405-723-224-502; 088-666-654-739-335; 091-622-417-034-204; 093-432-811-238-075; 096-964-521-741-752; 097-702-087-584-622; 098-270-332-446-910; 100-221-707-987-385; 105-583-418-831-173; 105-902-036-518-531; 112-572-847-909-135; 116-385-893-669-170; 124-714-309-513-842; 124-885-415-450-562; 132-937-990-592-892; 140-201-106-613-540; 141-183-596-550-369; 144-792-882-463-568; 155-219-342-663-670,47

Data sources The Cochrane Incontinence Group Specialised Register, electronic databases and the websites of relevant professional organisations and manufacturers, and the following databases: CINAHL, EMBASE, BIOSIS, Science Citation Index and Social Science Citation Index, Current Controlled Trials, ClinicalTrials.gov and the UKCRN Portfolio Database. Study selection The study comprised three distinct elements. (1) A survey of 188 women with SUI to identify outcomes of importance to them (activities of daily living; sex, hygiene and lifestyle issues; emotional health; and the availability of services). (2) A systematic review and meta-analysis of non-surgical treatments for SUI to find out which are most effective by comparing results of trials (direct pairwise comparisons) and by modelling results (mixed-treatment comparisons - MTCs). A total of 88 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) and quasi-RCTs reporting data from 9721 women were identified, considering five generic interventions [pelvic floor muscle training (PFMT), electrical stimulation (ES), vaginal cones (VCs), bladder training (BT) and serotonin-noradrenaline reuptake inhibitor (SNRI) medications], in many variations and combinations. Data were available for 37 interventions and 68 treatment comparisons by direct pairwise assessment. Mixed-treatment comparison models compared 14 interventions, using data from 55 trials (6608 women). (3) Economic modelling, using a Markov model, to find out which combinations of treatments (treatment pathways) are most cost-effective for SUI. Data extraction Titles and abstracts identified were assessed by one reviewer and full-text copies of all potentially relevant reports independently assessed by two reviewers. Any disagreements were resolved by consensus or arbitration by a third person. Results Direct pairwise comparison and MTC analysis showed that the treatments were more effective than no treatment. Delivering PFMT in a more intense fashion, either through extra sessions or with biofeedback (BF), appeared to be the most effective treatment [PFMT extra sessions vs no treatment (NT) odds ratio (OR) 10.7, 95% credible interval (CrI) 5.03 to 26.2; PFMT + BF vs NT OR 12.3, 95% CrI 5.35 to 32.7]. Only when success was measured in terms of improvement was there evidence that basic PFMT was better than no treatment (PFMT basic vs NT OR 4.47, 95% CrI 2.03 to 11.9). Analysis of cost-effectiveness showed that for cure rates, the strategy using lifestyle changes and PFMT with extra sessions followed by tension-free vaginal tape (TVT) (lifestyle advice-PFMT extra sessions-TVT) had a probability of greater than 70% of being considered cost-effective for all threshold values for willingness to pay for a QALY up to 50,000 pounds. For improvement rates, lifestyle advice-PFMT extra sessions-TVT had a probability of greater than 50% of being considered cost-effective when society's willingness to pay for an additional QALY was more than 10,000 pounds. The results were most sensitive to changes in the long-term performance of PFMT and also in the relative effectiveness of basic PFMT and PFMT with extra sessions. Limitations Although a large number of studies were identified, few data were available for most comparisons and long-term data were sparse. Challenges for evidence synthesis were the lack of consensus on the most appropriate method for assessing incontinence and intervention protocols that were complex and varied considerably across studies. Conclusions More intensive forms of PFMT appear worthwhile, but further research is required to define an optimal form of more intensive therapy that is feasible and efficient for the NHS to provide, along with further definitive evidence from large, well-designed studies.",14,40,1,215,Physical therapy;

Dougherty; J. Isaiah Harbison; Eddy J. Davelaar,"Recent years have seen an increased interest in understanding memory-retrieval dynamics and, in particular, what makes a person decide to terminate the memory-search process. We review research that has employed the open-ended retrieval paradigm (Dougherty & Harbison, 2007) and focus on the behavioral regularities it has revealed. The main finding of this research is that people’s memory-search behavior follows a lawful pattern of a convex decreasing relation between exit latency, or the time between the final retrieval and the decision to terminate search, and the number of items retrieved. Theoretical work has converged on a stopping rule that treats the retrieval process as a costly cognitive process that is truncated on the basis of a comparative judgment of perceived relative benefit.

The aim of the present study is to examine whether listeners with varying degrees of experience with (HI) children’s speech perceive a difference in the overall speech quality of seven-year-old NH children and their HI peers who received a device before the age of two. Method Short speech samples of seven children with NH, seven children with an acoustic hearing aid (HA) and seven children with a cochlear implant (CI) were judged by three groups of listeners (audiologists, primary school teachers and inexperienced listeners) in a comparative judgement task. In this task, listeners compared stimuli in pairs and decided which stimulus sounded better, leading to a ranking of the stimuli according to their overall speech quality. Results The ranking showed that the overall speech quality differed considerably for HI and NH children. The latter group had a significantly higher overall speech quality than HI children. In the group of HI children, children with CI were ranked higher than children with HA. Moreover, length of device use was found to have a significant effect in the group of children with CI: longer device experience led to better ratings. This effect was significantly less strong in HA children. No significant differences were found between the three groups of listeners. Conclusion Listeners agree that the speech of NH children sounds better than the speech of HI children. This result indicates that even after almost seven years of device use, the speech of HI children still differs from the speech of NH children. The overall speech quality of CI children was better than that of HA children, and this effect increased with longer device use. No effect of listeners’ experience with (NH and/or HI) children’s speech was established.",83,,105969,105969,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cochlear implant; Hearing aid; Speech quality; Device use; School teachers; Hearing impaired; Audiology; Language acquisition,Children with a cochlear implant; Children with an acoustic hearing aid; Comparative judgement; Dutch; Language acquisition; Overall speech quality,,,Research Foundation – Flanders,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31838317 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/31838317 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0021992418302119,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcomdis.2019.105969,31838317,10.1016/j.jcomdis.2019.105969,2992592525,,0,001-130-100-277-202; 001-754-164-523-164; 004-696-217-321-299; 006-719-044-652-648; 007-831-422-429-707; 011-105-391-999-886; 012-369-512-836-668; 013-144-232-373-899; 013-593-615-284-782; 015-557-768-911-489; 017-720-006-170-792; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-359-811-030-096; 020-713-368-659-029; 023-274-837-583-184; 025-876-548-391-398; 033-496-665-869-296; 034-292-989-156-93X; 034-916-355-837-98X; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-966-099-589-64X; 041-210-265-147-079; 048-151-229-726-003; 050-033-593-645-124; 054-431-844-896-470; 056-629-638-645-562; 057-256-104-389-821; 059-887-122-426-490; 068-082-537-772-027; 075-150-794-733-673; 075-572-320-002-166; 077-919-469-703-553; 089-006-008-308-736; 093-994-167-513-21X; 095-680-007-728-052; 100-082-039-286-526; 101-848-247-761-283; 119-844-918-979-554; 134-406-767-462-091; 136-025-635-303-850; 150-325-162-873-23X; 167-275-555-617-549,1
034-886-594-115-891,Decision Making under Uncertainty and Complexity : A study of young investors’ decision to buy warrants,,2009,,,,,,Marie Karlsson; Linda Kraufvelin,"Background: A warrant is a derivative that is normally issued over stocks. During the last financial crisis, the trading of warrants reached new records. The high leverage and the complexity of the product make the warrant a risky investment. Financial products such as warrants therefore imply a significant purchase decision for an individual and the consequences of making a poorly thought-out choice can be of considerable importance. Financial products require a high degree of involvement since the decision process is characterized by uncertainty of outcome and complexity of the product. Traditional theories on consumer decision making build on the assumptions of self-interest and rationality. In the context of financial services, the rationality of the decision process has been questioned within the field of behavioral economics, a field that suggests that the consumer is unable to make rational decisions as well as comparative judgments. Purpose: With a theoretical basis in the traditional consumer decision process, the purpose of this thesis is to examine and describe the decision making of young investors that buy warrants. Methodology: The study can be described as abdicative, since the subject of this thesis is based on an empirical problem observed in reality as well as based on existing theories on the subject. The thesis is furthermore a mixed qualitative and quantitative study. The empirical information was gathered using an Internet survey that was sent out to young investors that are members or are connected to financial associations or societies at different universities. Results: The study is considered to show that the decision making of young investors can be described as neither optimal nor rational when buying warrants. The respondents seldom seem to make efficient and as rational decisions as the traditional decision process model implies. Instead, individual characteristics and attitudes of the young investors affect their decision making.",,,,,Behavioral economics; Decision engineering; Financial services; Business; Decision fatigue; Actuarial science; Decision analysis; Rationality; Decision field theory; Business decision mapping,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:286551,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:286551,,,647417067,,0,,0

Milfont; Robert Thomson,"The spatial and temporal reach of contemporary environmental problems are unparalleled. Collective efforts to address global environmental problems are required but actions to tackle these problems demand initial recognition of their seriousness. Cross-cultural research has shown a reliable bias in comparative judgements about the severity of environmental problems for geographically distant places, with environmental issues perceived to be more severe “there” than “here.” The robustness of this effect may have unwarranted consequences since perceiving environmental problems as being worse elsewhere might lead individuals to not take actions in their locality. We conducted a within-country study to test whether this spatial bias would emerge for samples from all Brazilian states (k = 27, N = 4,265; 85% female; Age M = 24; Age SD = 9.67). Providing further support for a biased comparative judgement, we observed that the severity of environmental problems was judged as worse at the country level than at the state level (mean spatial bias score among Brazilian states = 0.54). Only 2% of the variation in spatial bias was attributable to across-state differences. By replicating cross-cultural findings within a single nation, our findings provide further support for the prevalence and generalizability of biased comparative judgements about the severity of environmental problems.

Breneiser; David M. Monetti; Katharine S. Adams,"The present study examines the above-average effect (Chambers & Windschitl, 2004; Moore & Small, 2007) in assessments of task performance. Participants completed self-estimates of performance and group estimates of performance, before and after completing a task. Participants completed a task individually and in groups. Groups were self-selected by participants, or randomly assigned by the researchers. Previous research examined the above-average effect in performance self-estimates for individuals, but little has been done examining the above-average effect in group performance. Results indicated robust above-average effects for both individual and group estimates of performance, and these effects were not limited by group type. Furthermore, above-average effects were observed for estimates of performance both before and after completion of the task, suggesting that participants were not more accurate in their post-task estimates. In addition to these data, results of a group-work survey administered to participants are disseminated, suggesting some practical applications for group work in the college classroom setting.The Nexus between the Above-Average Effect and Cooperative Learning in the ClassroomInstructors often hear students express the belief that their own academic performance is superior relative to their peers. In fact, there is a body of literature diat describes the general tendency for individuals to overestimate skills, abilities, and/or personal attributes as compared to ottiers within a variety of contexts (Moore & Small, 2007). This phenomenon is often referred to as the above-average (or better than average) effect (Chambers & Windschiti, 2004; Moore & Small, 2007; Hamamura, Heine, & Takemoto, 2007; Kanten & Teigen, 2008).There are numerous reasons why students may hold above-average beliefs regarding their academic performance. One explanation is that individuals are motivated to selfenhance, or believe they are better than the average person because it serves as a protective factor by promoting successful coping and personal wellbeing (Chambers & Windschitl, 2004; Taylor & Brown, 1988). Other researchers describe above-average effects as differentially weighted selfevaluations without meaningful comparison to the referent other (Chambers & WindschitL 2004; Klar & Guadi, 1999). Still other research suggests that above-average effects are influenced by differing amounts of comparative information available to those making evaluative judgments (Moore & Small, 2007). With more information about self, individuals make more informed estimates of their performance. With less information about others, individuals make comparative judgments based on their estimates of average group performance. These estimates, in the absence of diagnostic information (such as the performance abilities of others) are posited to be at least partially responsible for the aboveaverage effect (Moore & Small, 2007).It is important for educators to consider the potential positive and negative implications of the above-average effect in the classroom setting specifically. One potential benefit for educators and parents would be if the above-average effect positively influences self-esteem. Research indicates that individuals with high self-esteem tend to report being happier (Baumesiter, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2003). Another educationally relevant benefit involves the connection between having high self-efficacy and the types of academic challenges that a student would be willing to attempt and the amount of effort they are willing to exert in those tasks (Bandura, 1989). Obviously, there are also instances where the above-average effect could potentially be problematic. The most troubling outcome might be that the high, self-regard could result in increased narcissism. Narcissists tend to respond negatively when their ideas or behaviors are questioned (Rhodewalt & Morf, 1998). …",36,2,43,62,Psychology; Group work; Referent; Self-concept; Academic achievement; Narcissism; Cooperative learning; Coping (psychology); Social psychology; Protective factor,,,,,http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1061943.pdf https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3030686511/the-nexus-between-the-above-average-effect-and-cooperative https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1061943.pdf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1061943,http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1061943.pdf,,,72503416,,0,,1

Theoretical considerations are accompanied by a few numerical examples demonstrating how the selected heuristics can be used in practice.",133,4,367,386,Algorithm; Heuristics; Matrix (mathematics); Estimation theory; Heuristic; Weight; Pairwise comparison; Computer science; Numerical analysis; Mathematical optimization; Heuristics; Matrix (mathematics); Heuristic; Weight; Pairwise comparison; Mathematics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0386 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1309.0386 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1309.0386K/abstract http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-f7edef45-1fc2-45bf-ab3f-e7943212ae3c https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1309.html#Kulakowski13 https://content.iospress.com/articles/fundamenta-informaticae/fi133-4-03 http://arxiv.org/abs/1309.0386,http://dx.doi.org/10.3233/fi-2014-1081,,10.3233/fi-2014-1081,3105005508; 1755529572,,0,001-251-477-004-192; 006-292-024-020-432; 006-715-600-922-621; 009-881-393-198-900; 013-712-346-579-265; 020-499-240-517-983; 026-358-629-546-378; 028-454-054-636-147; 030-614-604-627-790; 031-167-148-604-214; 032-096-904-158-91X; 033-747-503-599-071; 037-431-789-266-612; 038-523-104-433-065; 038-722-503-769-828; 040-257-386-082-621; 040-520-796-156-684; 047-108-373-485-451; 048-606-985-433-968; 050-276-604-535-681; 051-525-616-582-208; 052-840-587-628-700; 057-038-371-738-322; 061-703-176-018-76X; 061-931-316-245-759; 067-143-980-711-210; 067-293-544-741-847; 078-797-661-745-239; 078-991-814-764-860; 090-134-173-730-262; 090-838-470-941-82X; 091-681-693-508-242; 103-674-775-092-816; 105-630-535-649-855; 125-513-366-485-249; 154-556-244-657-593; 164-064-718-436-744; 170-987-579-156-787,16

Assistive technology,17483115; 17483107,Taylor and Francis Ltd.,United Kingdom,Ghassan Kbar; Akshay Bhatia; Mustufa Haider Abidi; Ibraheem Al-Sharawy,"This study presents a novel method for evaluating the scientific research papers in the field of assistive technologies pertaining to different impairment conditions. The objectives are to understand the technologies used for addressing the needs of PWD by identifying relevant criteria for the assessment, explore the implications of these technologies in their lives and identify the gaps among certain technologies in assisting PWD. In this article, we reviewed around 40 research scientific papers in relation to the technologies used to assist PWD in their daily activities. A novel quantitative assessment methodology based on Multi-weighted Scoring Model (MWSM) has been developed. It is based on the judgement of clinical experts according to thirteen well-defined criteria. The proposed method is useful because it assesses the scientific studies related to PWD qualitatively according to efficient research coverage, as well as quantitatively in order to have good comparative judgment. Moreover, this method recognizes the research gap or areas which need further investigation and identifies the research papers that have good coverage of the respective criteria. Implications for Rehabilitation Human computer interface (HCI) solutions are critical for addressing the main issues facing people with disabilities (PWD) in their life. Assessment of scientific research papers according to well-defined criteria that address PWD needs would assist in verifying their suitability for PWDs. Novel quantitative assessment methodology is used for assessing these research papers using judgment of experienced researchers according to 13 well-defined criteria that have been weighted according to relevancy to different impairment groups. Identifying research papers that have good coverage of defined criteria and knowing the research area that needs further investigation by researchers and developers, would ultimately address the rehabilitation needs for PWD.",12,1,3,20,Engineering; Judgement; Rehabilitation; Self-Help Devices; Quantitative assessment; Assistive technology; Hearing impaired; Multimedia; Scientific method; Applied psychology; Activities of daily living,Assistive technology; hearing impaired; multi-weighted scoring method; person with disabilities; quantitative survey; speaking impaired,Correction of Hearing Impairment/instrumentation; Disabled Persons/rehabilitation; Humans; Motor Disorders/rehabilitation; Self-Help Devices; Speech Disorders/rehabilitation; User-Computer Interface; Vision Disorders/rehabilitation,,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26882961 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26882961 https://core.ac.uk/display/149971687 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.3109/17483107.2015.1129456,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/17483107.2015.1129456,26882961,10.3109/17483107.2015.1129456,2342989028,,0,001-451-848-222-620; 002-425-977-914-305; 010-436-683-090-156; 013-159-035-306-218; 013-404-721-881-876; 015-484-038-485-655; 017-141-229-695-418; 021-994-858-485-535; 023-658-804-007-95X; 024-086-786-855-300; 024-347-123-858-132; 030-537-995-801-007; 037-249-463-635-894; 043-868-687-016-080; 047-813-505-080-303; 048-134-912-264-347; 051-115-668-004-483; 063-501-170-583-730; 065-071-061-348-542; 065-667-776-876-16X; 067-273-951-151-766; 079-757-248-687-522; 081-547-256-855-879; 083-710-700-409-243; 084-273-046-840-111; 087-981-778-347-716; 096-501-306-595-245; 103-094-726-275-324; 113-263-403-396-348; 121-050-057-162-530; 126-052-916-794-474; 138-012-035-831-625; 165-149-997-140-020; 172-456-916-784-89X; 175-444-242-470-501,7

Una es un enfoque principalmente centradoen- el-agente, que se concentra en el razonamiento practico y la inteligibilidad de la accion y presta atencion a las inclinaciones y tendencias humanas. El otro enfoque, mas tradicional y principalmente centrado-en-el-mundo, se concentra en la metafisica del bien, mediante un analisis de la naturaleza humana y sus facultades y del modo en que ha de ser estructurado el bien, a fi n de convertirse en un objeto nuestro de busqueda, y mas especifi camente, en un fundamento de la toma de decisiones morales. En este articulo, adopto un enfoque centrado-en-el-mundo respecto a cuestiones fundamentales de contenido y estructura. Mirando, en primer lugar, a algunos ejemplos tipicos de las listas de bienes basicos, elaboradas por los teoricos de la ley natural, analizo diversos candidatos (propuestos por ellos) a la lista correcta. Luego, me centro en cuestiones relativas a como hay que estructurar la ley natural, en particular, si la lista de bienes basicos es fi nita, si hay un bien supremo o superordenador y que tipos de relaciones jerarquicas han de existir �en el interior de los bienes basicos y entre ellos�, a fi n de que los bienes basicos sirvan como fundamento para el razonamiento practico sobre la moralidad. Las conclusiones generales que extraigo son: en primer lugar, que hay que tomar en serio la ontologia y evitar los errores categoriales, al identifi car los bienes basicos; en segundo lugar, que la estructura del bien exige un sistema de principios que hagan posible los diversos tipos de juicios comparativos en el interior de los bienes basicos y entre ellos, a fi n de que la teoria de la ley natural sirva como base para guiar decisiones morales concretas. EnglishThere are two methodologically distinct but complementary ways of approaching natural law theory. One is a mainly agent-centred approach, focusing on practical reasoning and the intelligibility of action, paying attention to human tendencies and inclinations. Th e other, more traditional and mainly world-centred approach, focuses on the metaphysics of the good by means of an analysis of human nature and human faculties, and of the way in which the good must be structured for it to be an object of human pursuit, more specifi cally, a foundation for moral decision- making. In this paper I take a primarily world-centred approach to fundamental questions of content and structure. First, looking at some typical examples from natural law theorists of lists of the basic goods, I analyse various members that they have proposed to see what the correct list must contain. Next, I look at questions concerning how the natural law must be structured, in particular whether the list of basic goods is fi nite, whether there is a supreme or superordinate good, and what kinds of hierarchical relations within and across goods must exist in order for the basic goods to serve as a foundation for practical reasoning about morality. Th e general conclusions I draw are, fi rst, that ontology must be taken seriously, and miscategorization avoided, when identifying basic goods; secondly, that the structure of the good requires a system of principles enabling various kinds of comparative judgment within and across goods, in order for natural law theory to serve as a basis for guiding concrete moral decisions.",,2,9,12,,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/5625408.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5625408,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5625408,,,2555692910,,0,,0

The speech sounds of short sentences, each including three to five stressed syllables, spoken by 20 native speakers were used. The following definitions of the rhythm segment were adopted for comparative judgment: a stressed syllable and succeeding weak syllable sequence; preceding weak syllable sequence and a stressed syllable; a stressed syllable and a half of preceding and succeeding weak syllable sequences; and the interval between adjacent stressed syllables. The measurement based on the detailed acoustical analysis showed that the duration of each segment by the native speakers was distributed around a peak at about 0.7 second, which was considered to be a target rhythmic period. Some segments, which include the secondary stressed syllables, were distributed separately around a half of the target period. However, they could not be put closer to the main distribution, by exchanging the secondary stressed syllable for the primary one or weak syllable. For the universal description of the rhythm structure, the duration of the rhythm segment was approximated by a series of the target periods into which a half period was interpolated irregularly.",131,4,060006,3347,Syllable; Rhythm; Stress (linguistics); Acoustics; Speech recognition; Rhythm segment; Speech sounds; Mathematics,,,,,https://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/poma/15/1/10.1121/1.4887489 https://asa.scitation.org/doi/abs/10.1121/1.4887489,http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4708541,,10.1121/1.4708541,2088721236,,0,,0

Dean; Alicia C Lizarraga-Blackard,"Timber-harvesting operations, especially clearcutting (that is, harvesting operations where all of the trees in a given area are removed), have been criticized for many reasons, not least of which is their unsightly appearance. Forest managers have recognized this, and have attempted to place clearcuts in locations with limited viewsheds. In order to find such locations, forest managers have made extensive use of standard geographical information system (GIS) viewshed operations. The use of conventional viewshed operations ignores the possibility that the aesthetic impacts of clearcuts might be diminished by the screening effects of intervening vegetation, or the possibility that impacts simply decrease with increasing distance. In this study we found evidence that the aesthetic impacts of clearcuts do in fact diminish in these ways. Photograph transects were performed around ten clearcuts. Each transect produced a series of pictures showing the clearcut from increasing distances into the surrounding forest. The Law of Comparative Judgments (LCJ) technique was used to develop perceived-scenic-beauty rankings for each photograph. Statistical analyses showed aesthetic impacts do in fact diminish with viewing distance through screening vegetation. A modified viewshed algo- rithm was then developed not just to identify areas where clearcuts are visible, but also to map localized aesthetic impacts of clearcuts. The approach presented here could be used to develop similar models that map the aesthetic impacts of any proposed environmental modification.",,,,,Vegetation; Clearcutting; Geography; Viewshed analysis; Statistical analyses; Cartography; Transect,,,,,,,,,2384715985,,0,002-995-675-892-125; 003-656-666-537-471; 012-945-000-808-033; 014-340-912-764-273; 015-791-635-523-752; 021-144-766-372-612; 035-531-390-735-726; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-279-096-759-501; 039-684-580-137-623; 063-028-669-480-190; 070-161-551-181-909; 094-802-007-570-247; 128-462-880-218-479; 128-694-008-363-449; 135-498-570-969-013; 140-358-718-082-985; 151-583-760-533-209; 166-771-600-379-049; 187-307-065-356-402,0

Cutrone; David J. Heeger; Marisa Carrasco,"We investigated the attentional repulsion effect-stimuli appear displaced further away from attended locations-in three experiments: one with exogenous (involuntary) attention, and two with endogenous (voluntary) attention with different attention-field sizes. It has been proposed that differences in attention-field size can account for qualitative differences in neural responses elicited by attended stimuli. We used psychophysical comparative judgments and manipulated either exogenous attention via peripheral cues or endogenous attention via central cues and a demanding rapid serial visual presentation task. We manipulated the attention field size of endogenous attention by presenting streams of letters at two specific locations or at two of many possible locations during each block. We found a robust attentional repulsion effect in all three experiments: with endogenous and exogenous attention and with both attention-field sizes. These findings advance our understanding of the influence of spatial attention on the perception of visual space and help relate this repulsion effect to possible neurophysiological correlates.",18,6,8,8,Stimulus (physiology); Neurophysiology; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Visual space; Perception; Visual spatial attention; Disgust; Rapid serial visual presentation; Field size,,Adult; Attention/physiology; Cues; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Psychophysics; Reaction Time; Space Perception/physiology; Visual Fields/physiology,,NEI NIH HHS (P30 EY013079) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016200) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY019693) United States,https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/on-spatial-attention-and-its-field-size-on-the-repulsion-effect https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2685930 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30029219,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/18.6.8,30029219,10.1167/18.6.8,2883049645,PMC6012187,0,001-848-278-850-013; 001-966-795-917-308; 002-258-993-227-876; 002-739-234-229-894; 002-896-959-329-533; 003-198-583-089-698; 003-807-659-093-556; 005-332-982-210-093; 006-352-736-103-115; 006-890-882-656-98X; 008-239-446-486-873; 010-087-841-033-008; 011-601-854-227-368; 013-365-280-541-681; 014-568-640-265-841; 014-669-165-389-53X; 014-893-281-836-583; 015-378-253-108-079; 016-619-705-994-528; 018-644-983-172-951; 018-727-872-285-105; 018-989-769-655-163; 019-070-518-571-38X; 019-129-524-380-591; 019-928-047-798-143; 019-946-074-456-201; 020-858-712-838-577; 021-087-443-798-16X; 021-131-458-001-390; 021-509-708-837-636; 021-653-625-766-728; 021-706-576-030-98X; 022-037-109-194-206; 023-330-044-212-555; 023-396-011-016-330; 024-215-699-434-354; 026-139-329-819-899; 028-078-043-397-826; 028-782-439-311-83X; 029-228-556-200-221; 030-617-721-349-404; 034-996-904-827-702; 035-102-834-324-464; 035-600-460-328-488; 036-257-588-268-34X; 038-684-900-397-664; 039-137-725-040-740; 040-315-054-207-195; 041-001-417-980-49X; 041-893-010-281-781; 042-339-635-956-53X; 043-200-255-816-148; 043-418-701-057-420; 046-189-498-065-646; 048-825-702-677-162; 049-197-886-671-284; 054-226-703-954-451; 054-436-170-943-164; 054-472-182-870-394; 054-514-647-022-073; 054-689-512-080-190; 055-072-483-497-320; 056-058-144-104-41X; 056-141-522-259-193; 056-728-868-141-654; 057-590-452-747-502; 057-733-635-312-697; 059-424-379-092-456; 063-649-103-050-425; 065-237-377-955-397; 065-554-170-416-862; 071-375-876-033-947; 075-663-388-719-976; 076-957-332-678-757; 077-959-033-476-579; 078-155-644-930-518; 079-881-549-962-928; 081-862-490-349-739; 086-625-592-557-646; 088-827-300-195-697; 090-896-584-839-562; 091-670-027-508-175; 094-795-066-310-768; 096-155-872-966-355; 097-073-724-823-181; 097-250-909-662-702; 099-133-268-910-664; 101-263-675-754-713; 109-176-012-201-937; 110-183-437-083-746; 110-355-899-054-841; 110-546-023-473-621; 112-951-565-313-763; 113-366-679-301-057; 115-721-182-645-213; 118-584-061-971-371; 121-593-252-566-54X; 122-350-119-801-088; 126-674-176-598-123; 130-344-843-887-512; 132-100-364-569-455; 141-291-237-140-737; 153-799-434-217-513; 163-307-707-970-578; 198-167-120-363-048,10

A two-stage survey process is used to ask the experts to first identify and then evaluate the management issues. To develop effective-management priorities, these issues are evaluated in terms of their importance, urgency, achievability, and effectiveness, based on experts’ comparative and absolute judgments. A pairwise comparison process is used to help the experts make comparative judgments, while a linguistic rating method is used for absolute judgments. To reflect the inherent imprecision involved in the survey process, experts’ assessments are represented by triangular fuzzy numbers.

036-332-523-995-180,NIPS - Finite Sample Prediction and Recovery Bounds for Ordinal Embedding,2016-06-01,2016,conference proceedings,,,,,Lalit Jain; Kevin G. Jamieson; Robert D. Nowak,"The goal of ordinal embedding is to represent items as points in a low-dimensional Euclidean space given a set of constraints like ``item $i$ is closer to item $j$ than item $k$''. Ordinal constraints like this often come from human judgments. The classic approach to solving this problem is known as non-metric multidimensional scaling. To account for errors and variation in judgments, we consider the noisy situation in which the given constraints are independently corrupted by reversing the correct constraint with some probability. The ordinal embedding problem has been studied for decades, but most past work pays little attention to the question of whether accurate embedding is possible, apart from empirical studies. This paper shows that under a generative data model it is possible to learn the correct embedding from noisy distance comparisons. In establishing this fundamental result, the paper makes several new contributions. First, we derive prediction error bounds for embedding from noisy distance comparisons by exploiting the fact that the rank of a distance matrix of points in $\R^d$ is at most $d+2$.

Carson,"We briefly review and discuss traditional conjoint analysis (CA) and discrete choice experiments (DCEs), widely used stated preference elicitation methods in several disciplines. We pay particular attention to the origins and basis of CA, and show that it is generally inconsistent with economic demand theory, and is subject to several logical inconsistencies that make it unsuitable for use in applied economics, particularly welfare and policy assessment. We contrast this with DCEs that have a long-standing, well-tested theoretical basis in random utility theory, and we show why and how DCEs are more general and consistent with economic demand theory.

Brown,"While contemporary civil engineering projects are increasingly complex, the cognitive abilities of the decision maker remain limited. There is a conflict between the complexity that is required to describe a scenario with all its relevant properties and the limited number of ideas that can be included in rational considerations and decisions.

In this paper, a systems approach provides a general decisionmaking scheme that makes involvement in broadly based decisions accessible. This scheme is valid at all scales and in all classes of problems. This paper establishes a practical method for generating systems that contain all features relevant to a professional decision. The criterion of decision invariance is offered as a guide for establishing the size of the system model considered by the decision maker.

Sailor; Edward J. Shoben,"Models of comparative judgment have assumed that relative magnitude is computed from knowledge about absolute magnitude rather than retrieved directly. In Experiment 1, participants verified the relative size of part-whole pairs (e.g.,tree-leaf ) and unrelated controls (e.g.,tree-penny). The symbolic distance effect was much smaller for part-whole pairs than for unrelated controls. In two subsequent experiments, participants determined either which of two objects was closer in size to a third object or which of two pairs had a greater difference in the size of its constituents. In contrast to the paired comparison task in Experiment 1, judgments of part-whole items were more sensitive to the influence of symbolic distance than were unrelated controls. The fact that the part-whole relation attenuates the effects of symbolic distance in a paired comparison task but not in tasks that require an explicit comparison of size differences suggests that the part-whole relation provides a source of information about relative magnitude that does not depend on knowledge about absolute magnitude.",28,4,585,596,Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; The Symbolic; Distance effect; Relative magnitude; Paired comparison; Part whole; Absolute magnitude; Magnitude (mathematics); Social psychology,,Adult; Concept Formation; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Recall; Paired-Associate Learning; Problem Solving; Size Perception,,NIGMS NIH HHS (S06GM08225) United States,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.3758/BF03201249.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10946542 https://paperity.org/p/17455061/the-role-of-part-whole-information-in-reasoning-about-relative-size https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/BF03201249,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/bf03201249,10946542,10.3758/bf03201249,2019141855,,0,000-554-668-882-790; 003-375-024-877-035; 011-794-460-334-72X; 013-621-028-229-557; 014-304-423-897-683; 016-000-197-860-064; 025-971-418-331-624; 027-806-144-236-77X; 027-974-037-266-255; 039-183-865-928-263; 046-243-812-882-439; 047-116-933-879-118; 049-219-036-575-071; 054-107-644-853-391; 058-610-642-082-320; 061-556-739-571-730; 069-344-951-519-071; 072-028-777-560-506; 072-107-014-286-807; 090-473-073-536-194; 094-087-384-386-015; 094-898-738-351-936; 101-778-629-528-62X; 102-439-680-363-787; 110-055-879-281-073; 113-597-147-012-180; 117-754-333-941-321; 124-257-870-583-335; 125-382-726-486-898; 129-283-270-268-631; 164-313-414-317-839; 166-688-877-483-052; 175-397-495-157-485; 176-017-510-665-867,2

In previous studies, the comparison and same-different task were most frequently used to investigate this distance effect. Recently, it was questioned whether the non-symbolic distance effects derived from these tasks originate at the same level. In the current study, we examined the behavioral and neural distance effects of the comparison and same-different task to assess potential differences between both tasks. Participants were first year university students. Each participant completed both tasks, while their reaction time, accuracy and brain activity on predefined components was measured. The early N1-P2p transition and the P2p component on temporo-occipital and inferior parietal electrode groups were considered, as well as the late P3 component on a central electrode group. The results showed that the behavioral distance effects from both tasks were comparable, although participants’ performance was worse on the same-different task. The neural results revealed similar effects of distance on the mean amplitudes for the early components for both tasks (all p’s < .02) and an additional effect of task difficulty on the mean amplitudes of these components. Similar as in previous studies, we found a (marginally) significant increase in mean amplitude of the later P3 component with increasing distance for the comparison (p = .07), but not for the same-different task. Apparently, the initial stages of number processing are comparable for both tasks, but an additional later stage is only present for the comparison task.

037-094-759-392-621,PICS - Comparative Analysis of Bradley-Terry and Thurstone-Mosteller Paired Comparison Models for Image Quality Assessment.,,2001,book,,,,,John C. Handley,"In image quality assessment, preference for various image processing algorithms or treatments is often determined using paired comparisons. In this experimental design, pairs of images processed by different algorithms or “treatments” are presented to a judge. The preferred treatment is selected and a tally is kept of the number of times each treatment is preferred to another. It is possible to estimate an interval scale for treatments in a hypothetical psychological space using this method. There are two dominate paired comparison statistical models: Thurstone-Mosteller Case V (TM) (corresponding to Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment, Case V) and Bradley-Terry (BT). Although TM is used almost exclusively in the imaging literature, the BT formulation is more mathematically developed. Owing to its parsimony, it provides tractable maximum-likelihood estimators for scales, simultaneous confidence intervals and hypothesis tests for model fit, uniformity, and differences among populations of judges. In practice, TM and BT yield nearly identical scale estimates for complete data. In some experimental designs, many treatments are compared. Owing to the large number of possible treatment pairs, not every comparison is made, leading to an incomplete matrix of preference counts. Unlike TM, BT model applies directly to incomplete data under mild restrictions We compare and critique TM and BT models. Statistical analyses, many not available under TM, are demonstrated. An argument is made that BT offers overwhelming advantages to the imaging community and should be used instead of TM. Introduction This paper compares two well-known paired comparison models: the Thurstone-Mosteller (TM) model (by which we mean Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment, Case V) and the Bradley-Terry (BT) model. (Mosteller’s name is included in TM due to his work on the statistical analysis of Thurstone’s model). We argue here that BT model should be used in place of TM because presently the former is more developed mathematically than the latter. In particular, easy formulas exist for maximum likelihood estimates (mle) of scale parameters. The asymptotic theory of mle’s yields estimators for confidence regions and test statistics based on likelihood ratios for hypothesis testing. TM is privileged within the imaging community ostensibly owing to its origins in psychophysics. Yet it is universally acknowledged that TM and BT yield similar scale estimates. The theory (and software) for generalized linear models can produce mle’s yet BT, with its roots in experimental design and consumer choice modeling, offers numerically easier statistical procedures. We present no new research although we do show an alternative analysis to previously published data. Our intent is to provide the imaging community with a general context for paired comparisons, compare and contrast the two models, and demonstrate the advantages of BT. The Linear Model TM and BT models are both linear models of paired comparisons. In such models, probabilities of preference can be mapped to scales. Formally (following David, 1988 [4]), let i V and j V represent “merits” of objects i A and j A , respectively. In a psychophysics setting, the i V might represent sensation magnitudes on a scale. We represent the observed merit of object i A by random variable i X owing to observation-to-observation variation. A linear model takes the form ( ) ( ) i j i j ij P X X H V V π > ≡ = − (1) where H is a monotonic, increasing function such that ( ) 0 H −∞ = , ( ) 1 H +∞ = , and ( ) 1 ( ) H x H x − = − . There are obviously an infinite number of choices for function H, the two of concern here are the Thurstone-Mosteller model where H is the normal cumulative distribution function with zero mean and the Bradley-Terry model where [ ] 1 ( ) 1 tanh( / 2) 2 H x x = + (2) The task is to produce estimates i v of i V , 1, , i m = . If the function H has additional parameters, we need to estimate those as well. Assume without loss of generality 1 0 m i i V = = ∑ and define ij i j V V δ = − . Estimation proceeds by tallying ij α , the number of times object i A is preferred to object j A after ij n comparisons. A sample estimate of ij π is / ij ij ij p n α = . We define ( ) ij ij H d p = and compute merit or scale estimates i v by ij i j d v v = − , i j ≠ , , 1, , i j m = . It can be shown that a least squares estimate of i V is 1 m i ij i j v d m ≠ = ∑ (3) This estimate holds regardless of H and is the usual method for Thurstone’s Case V model. Assume that each pair is observed a fixed (but possibly unequal) number of times. That is, the sums ij n are fixed and the tallies ij α are binomial random variables: ( ) (1 ) , 0,1, , ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij ij n n P n α α α π π α α − = − =       (4) Owing to independence, the likelihood function is",,,108,112,Cumulative distribution function; Statistics; Combinatorics; Random variable; Linear model; Law of comparative judgment; Without loss of generality; Interval Scale; Computer science; Generalized linear model; Likelihood function,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Handley/publication/2930678_Comparative_Analysis_of_Bradley-Terry_and_Thurstone-Mosteller_Paired_Comparison_Models_for_Image_Quality_Assessment/links/0912f50da44c853131000000.pdf?origin=publication_detail https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pics/pics2001.html#Handley01,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/pics/pics2001.html#Handley01,,,257469455,,0,043-741-941-481-335; 065-906-991-595-286; 088-185-235-230-617; 109-490-821-576-320; 113-278-954-446-219; 117-352-939-718-472; 136-510-755-969-787; 166-585-827-428-918; 178-422-975-780-285,40

The culture medium composition was optimized to increase the capability of 3B-2 for producing biosurfactant. The produced biosurfactant was characterized in terms of protein concentration, surface tension and oil-displacement efficiency. The optimal medium for biosurfactant production contained: 0.5% lactose, 1.1% yeast extract, 2% sodium chloride and 0.1% disodium hydrogen phosphate. Under optimal conditions (28°C), the surface tension of crude biosurfactant could be reduced to 41 from 71.5 mN/m (water), while its protein concentration was increased to up to 6.5 g/L and the oil displacement efficiency was improved dramatically at 6.5 cm. Two glycoprotein fractions with the molecular masses of 22 and 40 kDa were purified from the biosurfactant, which held great potential for applications in microbial enhanced oil recovery and bioremediation.",6,,976,976,Yeast extract; Bioremediation; Vibrio; Lactose; Vibrio alginolyticus; Microbial enhanced oil recovery; Food science; Bacteria; Sodium; Biology; Microbiology,Vibrio alginolyticus; glycoproteins; microbial biosurfactant; optimal production; surface tension,,,,http://ir.yic.ac.cn/handle/133337/17091 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00976/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26441908 http://ir.yic.ac.cn/bitstream/133337/17091/1/2015-%3f%3f%3fFront.%20Microbiol%20.pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00976/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00976/pdf http://www.irgrid.ac.cn/handle/1471x/1095391 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4585178 https://core.ac.uk/display/71573128 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82848588.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fmicb.2015.00976,26441908,10.3389/fmicb.2015.00976,1835759956,PMC4585178,0,001-179-861-024-40X; 002-424-204-533-995; 002-638-038-422-029; 003-538-207-759-801; 010-944-398-171-249; 011-610-859-449-802; 011-804-341-518-055; 014-969-728-399-93X; 018-238-424-033-548; 019-279-961-407-098; 019-753-102-587-735; 023-592-408-217-606; 027-325-239-797-695; 029-023-036-149-814; 030-905-362-141-295; 045-114-162-177-895; 048-871-968-386-693; 050-320-015-840-544; 050-624-208-575-890; 055-742-101-052-909; 057-454-518-306-472; 057-535-056-879-288; 058-182-911-255-093; 059-071-164-167-667; 059-327-817-586-946; 059-514-587-033-134; 069-766-900-161-081; 072-169-301-121-494; 074-833-598-469-015; 085-444-274-608-058; 088-262-116-669-041; 090-401-101-673-899; 102-763-146-962-493; 108-718-912-787-950; 128-115-814-101-882; 134-420-579-368-509; 138-593-120-153-767; 169-069-739-194-742; 194-009-354-371-607,18

One important issue concerns whether consumers process price information in a similar way to that found in numerical cognition research. Since numerical processing is a learned, primarily automatic process, whether such processing interferes with or facilitates the processing of price information is an important question. It is important because a better understanding of how people process price information has implications for how managers should establish and communicate prices.

When separate assessments were compared with an integrated assessment using a kinetic model of a hypothetical randomized trial of antiplatelet agents in patients with acute coronary syndrome, the former showed treatment A to be superior to treatment B, whereas the latter showed treatment B to be superior to treatment A. In conclusion, comparative judgments regarding the balance between efficacy and safety depend on the model chosen for analysis; kinetic models are particularly suited to the integrated assessment of efficacy and safety relative to regulatory decisions, public policy, guideline development, and clinical care. 2014",,,,,Public policy; Professional association; Randomized controlled trial; Physical therapy; Alternative medicine; Acute coronary syndrome; Kinetic model; In patient; Clinical trial; Medicine,,,,,,,,,2338532406,,0,000-531-575-236-19X; 002-245-806-523-686; 003-532-274-878-408; 003-711-547-593-875; 008-370-899-184-281; 011-378-373-051-024; 015-567-817-927-719; 016-690-927-218-024; 017-669-059-346-578; 020-002-359-441-051; 021-266-293-196-932; 023-058-959-818-635; 026-364-983-309-798; 030-985-392-425-363; 035-105-101-576-836; 044-589-321-908-716; 046-113-666-570-65X; 052-961-296-551-193; 054-287-490-536-545; 059-960-857-085-277; 064-919-589-697-002; 087-655-452-396-67X; 109-041-235-734-898; 112-491-920-263-138; 134-369-073-039-192; 136-622-044-919-544; 159-564-351-000-230,0

Burr; Maria Concetta Morrone,"Psychophysical studies have shown that numerosity is a sensory attribute susceptible to adaptation. Neuroimaging studies have reported that, at least for relatively low numbers, numerosity can be accurately discriminated in the intra-parietal sulcus. Here we developed a novel rapid adaptation paradigm where adapting and test stimuli are separated by pauses sufficient to dissociate their BOLD activity. We used multivariate pattern recognition to classify brain activity evoked by non-symbolic numbers over a wide range (20-80), both before and after psychophysical adaptation to the highest numerosity. Adaptation caused underestimation of all lower numerosities, and decreased slightly the average BOLD responses in V1 and IPS. Using support vector machine, we showed that the BOLD response of IPS, but not in V1, classified numerosity well, both when tested before and after adaptation. However, there was no transfer from training pre-adaptation responses to testing post-adaptation, and vice versa, indicating that adaptation changes the neuronal representation of the numerosity. Interestingly, decoding was more accurate after adaptation, and the amount of improvement correlated with the amount of perceptual underestimation of numerosity across subjects. These results suggest that numerosity adaptation acts directly on IPS, rather than indirectly via other low-level stimulus parameters analysis, and that adaptation improves the capacity to discriminate numerosity.",143,,364,377,Brain activity and meditation; Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Neuroscience; Parietal lobe; Communication; Brain mapping; Posterior parietal cortex; Sensory system,Adaptation; Multivariate decoding; Number perception; Parietal cortex; fMRI,"Adaptation, Physiological/physiology; Adult; Brain Mapping/methods; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Parietal Lobe/diagnostic imaging; Pattern Recognition, Automated/methods; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Psychophysics/methods; Support Vector Machine; Young Adult",,Seventh Framework Programme,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage143.html#CastaldiATBM16 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5139983 https://core.ac.uk/display/82416196 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27622396 https://moh-it.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/effects-of-adaptation-on-numerosity-decoding-in-the-human-brain https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916304839 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811916304839 https://arpi.unipi.it/handle/11568/841136 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.09.020 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82416196.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.09.020,27622396,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2016.09.020,2521025716,PMC5139983,0,002-795-160-076-683; 004-030-636-268-081; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-509-606-504-240; 005-797-468-767-542; 006-720-642-879-031; 006-990-774-660-71X; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-697-446-644-27X; 013-254-779-044-236; 016-265-831-493-710; 017-037-552-101-413; 018-224-534-275-858; 019-640-192-172-363; 020-744-163-497-427; 026-617-630-691-234; 026-753-324-107-120; 027-977-770-698-804; 028-138-337-971-768; 030-452-089-893-867; 031-316-795-276-233; 032-188-208-040-57X; 032-346-912-513-239; 035-402-974-768-248; 036-822-695-173-820; 037-331-117-946-211; 037-436-823-090-386; 038-741-726-616-443; 039-555-369-773-746; 041-067-189-502-518; 041-096-611-048-369; 041-398-777-156-814; 041-442-979-711-770; 042-366-406-891-692; 047-240-103-551-891; 047-440-067-968-409; 048-140-321-419-731; 048-315-250-693-603; 049-007-929-029-76X; 051-065-078-444-590; 054-674-417-361-62X; 059-101-961-837-779; 062-537-064-413-234; 066-451-801-924-025; 071-011-326-519-531; 072-603-939-753-887; 078-743-910-357-373; 078-824-478-971-992; 079-652-959-557-811; 082-391-920-356-292; 082-636-988-384-700; 089-161-519-736-812; 090-991-808-447-687; 092-307-014-407-121; 092-491-995-641-38X; 095-706-794-082-846; 098-223-097-606-416; 099-432-075-001-835; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-936-931-089-579; 110-878-263-543-335; 115-962-254-198-270; 116-953-283-915-381; 122-423-243-764-899; 129-827-356-327-594; 130-220-778-507-792; 148-109-547-289-212; 168-155-571-377-143,35

Schupp; Britta Renner,"People often view themselves more favorably than others, displaying unrealistic optimism. In the present study, we investigated whether people perceive their reasons for eating as better than those of others. Furthermore, we investigated which mechanisms of inaccuracy might underlie a possible bias when perceiving why people eat what they eat. In Study 1, 117 participants rated the social desirability of eating motives. In Study 2, 772 participants provided information on their own and others’ motives for eating behavior. In Study 1, particularly desirable motives were eating because of hunger, health reasons, and liking. Particularly undesirable motives were eating to make a good impression, to comply with social norms, and to regulate negative affect. Study 2 revealed that for socially desirable motives, participants perceived their own motives to be stronger; for undesirable motives, the opposite pattern emerged, with others being attributed stronger motives. Moreover, the perception of others’ emotional and social motives varied with participants’ own healthy eating behavior. Since the perception of eating motives of others should be independent of one’s own behavior, this pattern of results indicates a relative inaccuracy in the perception of others’ eating motives. In conclusion, there is evidence for unrealistic optimism in eating motives. For social and emotional motives, this self-favoring view seems to be driven by a relatively inaccurate perception of others.",8,,209,209,Norm (social); Psychology; Optimism; Self-assessment; Perception; Healthy eating; Self other; Eating behavior; Affect (psychology); Social psychology,eating motives; healthy eating; optimistic bias; peer-perception; self-favoring bias; self-other bias; self-perception; unrealistic optimism,,,Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung; Bundesministerium für Bildung und Forschung,https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/38587 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00209/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00209/pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5309212 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28261140 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00209/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82870057 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82870057.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00209,28261140,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00209,2589024639,PMC5309212,0,000-111-710-035-921; 002-597-966-013-414; 003-079-530-678-577; 003-498-762-032-886; 003-708-115-592-927; 005-284-116-789-218; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-011-825-039-140; 010-493-681-523-780; 012-419-306-168-454; 012-711-607-971-687; 013-607-207-066-633; 014-122-070-250-771; 014-250-530-986-293; 017-672-929-943-884; 018-067-778-035-125; 019-106-817-258-651; 020-680-434-310-434; 021-764-644-202-057; 023-926-631-266-07X; 024-048-245-935-167; 025-477-608-977-537; 027-079-605-951-20X; 027-739-741-326-610; 034-353-748-495-355; 036-452-385-471-317; 037-853-496-415-805; 040-800-003-046-511; 042-434-831-118-424; 043-461-975-829-006; 044-571-678-980-184; 047-917-719-811-219; 051-149-513-582-524; 053-094-204-458-439; 054-966-158-757-869; 056-980-563-499-465; 057-761-715-276-049; 061-142-370-003-855; 062-518-943-445-116; 062-637-514-391-537; 064-017-034-126-916; 069-871-400-863-612; 078-200-375-715-392; 096-263-274-382-286; 098-582-156-606-630; 100-693-821-641-957; 101-474-422-016-915; 103-855-444-710-723; 107-854-421-865-889; 121-237-009-832-86X; 127-800-985-139-059; 127-919-292-584-684; 137-849-501-622-862; 138-114-329-315-13X; 147-606-980-703-526; 162-413-360-501-029; 174-382-270-754-74X,13

Dweck,"Abstract Knowing what we don't yet know is critical for learning. Nonetheless, people typically overestimate their prowess—but is this true of everyone? Three studies examined who shows overconfidence and why. Study 1 demonstrated that participants with an entity (fixed) theory of intelligence, those known to avoid negative information, showed significantly more overconfidence than those with more incremental (malleable) theories. In Study 2, participants who were taught an entity theory of intelligence allocated less attention to difficult problems than those taught an incremental theory. Participants in this entity condition also displayed more overconfidence than those in the incremental condition, and this difference in overconfidence was mediated by the observed bias in attention to difficult problems. Finally, in Study 3, directing participants' attention to difficult aspects of the task reduced the overconfidence of those with more entity views of intelligence.

Keane,"In group decision making, multiple decision makers (DMs) aim to reach a consensus ranking of alternatives in a decision problem. The differing expertise, experience and, potentially conflicting, interests of the DMs will result in the need for some form of conciliation to achieve consensus. Pairwise comparisons are commonly used to elicit values of preference of a DM. The aggregation of the preferences of multiple DMs must additionally consider potential conflict between DMs and how these conflicts may result in a need for compromise to reach group consensus.We present an approach to aggregating the preferences of multiple DMs, utilizing multi-objective optimization, to derive and highlight underlying conflict between the DMs when seeking to achieve consensus. Extracting knowledge of conflict facilitates both traceability and transparency of the trade-offs involved when reaching a group consensus.Further, the approach incorporates inconsistency reduction during the aggregation process to seek to diminish adverse effects upon decision outcomes. The approach can determine a single final solution based on either global compromise information or through utilizing weights of importance of the DMs.Within multi-criteria decision making, we present a case study within the Analytical Hierarchy Process from which we derive a richer final ranking of the decision alternatives.",322,20,257,275,Decision problem; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Group decision-making; Mathematics; Operations research; Compromise; Management science; Multi-objective optimization; Analytic hierarchy process; Genetic algorithm,,,,Engineering and Physical Science Research Council,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isci/isci322.html#AbelMK15 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/group-aggregation-of-pairwise-comparisons-using-multiobjective-optimization(dac2204c-3761-4925-992c-0edd1791a3ec).html https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:270513 https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/group-aggregation-of-pairwise-comparisons-using-multi-objective-o https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.05.027 https://core.ac.uk/display/82021139 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020025515003862 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82021139.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2015.05.027,,10.1016/j.ins.2015.05.027,818659084,,0,000-541-797-292-217; 003-869-986-440-475; 009-881-393-198-900; 010-836-835-875-247; 011-413-419-355-412; 013-081-807-477-707; 015-050-303-686-75X; 021-600-961-282-686; 029-519-181-104-726; 032-096-904-158-91X; 032-927-889-153-145; 035-230-794-828-719; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-816-599-685-509; 050-893-547-167-002; 051-523-085-776-820; 061-703-176-018-76X; 068-097-817-047-550; 086-509-832-677-64X; 090-746-329-079-283; 092-561-349-524-139; 098-825-162-330-339; 100-077-915-060-556; 101-859-588-779-696; 102-075-874-525-735; 107-829-981-326-811; 115-636-539-007-569; 142-496-868-258-083; 153-949-656-659-051; 159-895-211-930-977; 171-660-160-459-318; 184-932-775-129-823; 198-414-136-379-98X,12

General,19392222; 00221015; 00963445,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Luca Rinaldi; Marco Marelli,"It has been suggested that the origins of number words can be traced back to an evolutionarily ancient approximate number system, which represents quantities on a compressed scale and complies with Weber's law. Here, we use a data-driven computational model, which learns to predict 1 event (a word in a text corpus) from associated events, to characterize verbal behavior relative to number words in natural language, without appeal to perception. We show that the way humans use number words in spontaneous language reliably depends on numerical ratio-a clear signature of Weber's law-thus, perfectly mirroring the human and nonhuman psychophysical performance in comparative judgments of numbers. Most notably, the adherence to Weber's law is robustly replicated in a wide range of different languages. Together, these findings suggest that the everyday use of number words in language rests upon a preverbal approximate number system, which would affect the handling of numerical information not only at the input level but also at the level of verbal production.

A number of tools and methodological frameworks are available — such as rating systems, traditional decision-making techniques, checklists, and different evaluation frameworks and models. While these tools are highly valuable, some practical issues remain unsolved. There is also a need for more standardized tools to appraise the sustainability of transport projects. This paper is a presentation of a review on the current assessment tools of sustainability applied to transport infrastructure projects. The preliminary part of the paper is an explanatory and comparative analysis of the tools and methods in terms of their effectiveness to appraise sustainability. The analysis is a critical evaluation of the current state of the art to identify the limitations of existing approaches, point out new areas of research, and propose a sustainability appraisal agenda for the fu...",35,5,622,649,Engineering management; Engineering; Sustainability organizations; Sustainability appraisal; Transport infrastructure; Management science; Sustainable development; Sustainability,,,,European Investment Bank; Spanish Ministry of Economy and Competitiveness,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1041435 https://ideas.repec.org/a/taf/transr/v35y2015i5p622-649.html http://oa.upm.es/46364/ https://trid.trb.org/view/1365339 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:taf:transr:v:35:y:2015:i:5:p:622-649 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01441647.2015.1041435 https://core.ac.uk/display/84139324 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/84139324.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01441647.2015.1041435,,10.1080/01441647.2015.1041435,1784888296,,0,000-184-841-580-185; 000-438-019-158-219; 001-935-136-426-909; 002-179-777-627-618; 002-701-421-677-103; 003-550-080-967-321; 004-484-928-902-474; 004-800-534-286-113; 007-732-128-197-251; 007-852-641-594-633; 008-744-489-829-415; 010-549-757-602-566; 013-070-066-407-520; 014-236-677-819-78X; 020-784-494-634-496; 025-401-185-672-756; 025-651-796-528-157; 025-964-357-327-57X; 027-351-242-419-993; 027-983-087-652-36X; 028-160-591-938-091; 029-662-702-439-081; 030-763-093-847-239; 030-954-348-625-817; 033-549-271-966-938; 033-961-617-436-577; 034-462-943-992-667; 035-856-503-090-828; 037-204-759-242-433; 038-611-005-116-048; 039-503-930-970-274; 040-996-914-154-502; 043-240-999-748-738; 046-424-665-300-98X; 047-908-717-061-325; 048-673-874-680-675; 050-110-046-730-019; 050-990-114-308-927; 051-897-532-529-853; 053-409-735-697-15X; 056-209-179-299-224; 059-705-109-049-387; 060-762-002-913-67X; 061-339-659-412-990; 062-191-413-204-401; 066-507-373-417-608; 072-071-215-652-381; 072-196-745-765-251; 072-312-913-401-605; 074-251-629-639-380; 075-492-681-549-685; 076-587-483-803-88X; 077-233-860-885-664; 078-698-609-680-921; 079-923-613-348-723; 081-216-958-958-948; 085-665-148-159-748; 085-744-534-553-298; 088-366-466-708-051; 089-465-934-740-635; 091-090-897-760-162; 092-879-068-353-337; 097-233-101-936-227; 101-981-737-101-328; 106-614-260-389-543; 112-667-021-416-117; 113-896-038-008-342; 115-816-894-879-597; 117-296-178-972-674; 117-426-856-640-509; 118-067-384-847-943; 119-449-204-542-959; 123-276-057-396-42X; 127-728-228-173-838; 128-837-766-804-245; 129-337-023-506-373; 129-689-172-755-436; 129-711-669-548-027; 131-377-745-508-176; 131-560-261-404-552; 135-196-467-654-44X; 135-915-992-532-676; 136-144-284-923-397; 138-180-747-646-519; 144-093-386-478-848; 145-065-827-268-001; 145-914-070-042-185; 150-667-002-735-014; 152-008-897-252-294; 158-279-600-096-693; 162-046-398-657-334; 170-774-171-214-737; 170-993-023-137-346; 183-678-182-751-740; 192-698-884-638-501; 195-923-040-055-696,51

The proposed methodology reverses the pairwise coupling and employs the Bradley–Terry formulation for estimating pairwise comparison models. This methodology was implemented through relevant models in Agent-Based Dynamic Activity Planning and Scheduling (ADAPTS) and aims for solving pairwise activity conflicts. At one step of the framework, given the default algorithm, agents have to make a choice between in-home and out-of-home activities. At this time step, the reverse pairwise comparison models are called to investigate the agents’ resources and conditions for making the most probable decision about which activity to engage in. This work was conducted in conjunction with an earlier effort to incorporate in-home activities into ADAPTS, and the models proposed provide a behavioral decision-making process for this purpose.",2566,2566,41,54,Scheduling (computing); Pairwise comparison; Activity scheduling; Pairwise coupling; Time step; Computer science; Real-time computing; Theoretical computer science,,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view/1393986 https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/public/201702290615740412 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3141/2566-05 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.3141/2566-05,https://trid.trb.org/view/1393986,,,2562400057,,0,000-108-263-335-246; 001-390-294-611-467; 013-856-960-566-280; 014-130-560-893-251; 018-211-014-689-579; 034-061-128-076-577; 046-761-690-220-436; 068-949-556-372-271; 074-236-783-515-946; 074-506-843-122-456; 103-467-606-760-666; 126-806-352-582-959; 129-417-646-960-097,6

Goodale,"Traditionally, research on vision focused on its role in perception and our cognitive life. Except for the study of eye movements, which have been regarded as an information-seeking adjunct to visual perception, little attention was paid to the way in which vision is used to control our actions, particularly the movements of our hands and limbs. Over the last 25 years all of that has changed. Researchers are now actively investigating the way in which vision is used to control a broad range of complex goal-directed action - and are exploring the neural substrates of that control. A new model of the functional organization of the visual pathways in the primate cerebral cortex has emerged, one that posits a division of labor between vision-for-action (the dorsal stream) and vision-for-perception (the ventral stream). In this review, I examine some of the seminal work on the role of vision in the control of manual prehension and on the visual cues that play a critical role in this important human skill. I then review the key evidence for the perception-action model, particularly with reference to the role of the dorsal stream in the control of manual prehension, touching on recent work that both reinforces and challenges this account of the organization of the visual system.",51,13,1567,1587,Sensory cue;

Flynn; Julien E. Forder; Beryl Wall,"Objective The aim of this study was to develop a measure of social care outcome, an equivalent to the quality-adjusted life year (QALY) in health, which could be used in a range of circumstances. Design The project drew on previous and parallel work developing the Adult Social Care Outcome Toolkit and the national Adult Social Care Survey. We developed and tested an instrument designed to reflect service users' social care-related quality of life (SCRQoL) and tested it with 30 service users from a variety of user groups and 300 older home care service users. In parallel, we explored discrete choice experiment (DCE) and best-worst scaling (BWS) approaches to preference elicitation with 300 members of the general population, and cognitively tested these with service users. We also cognitively tested a computer-aided time trade-off (TTO) exercise using SCRQoL attributes with members of the general population. In the second phase, using the finalised instruments, BWS interviews were conducted with 500 members of the general population, TTO interviews with a follow-up sample of 126 of these respondents, and BWS interviews with 458 people using equipment services. Main outcome measures The final measure had eight domains: personal cleanliness and comfort, accommodation cleanliness and comfort, food and drink, safety, social participation and involvement, occupation, control over daily life and dignity. In addition to measuring current SCRQoL, the instrument includes questions used to establish service users' views of their 'expected' SCRQoL in the absence of services. The difference between a person's current and 'expected' SCRQoL provides an indicator of service impact. Results There was good evidence for the validity of the descriptive system and the validity of the current, expected and SCRQoL gain scales. The DCE and BWS approaches yielded similar results and, once introductions made clear, were understood by service users. BWS was used for the main stages, as it had technical and cognitive advantages. The computer-aided approach to TTO worked well, and respondents found questions acceptable and understandable. There were no substantive differences in the preferences of service users and the general population. The key domain was control over daily life, with the lowest and highest levels strongly estimated in all models. After allowing for observable heterogeneity, service users' preferences appeared to be more closely associated with their own SCRQoL than with those of the general population. The consistency of the results with the results of a previous study allowed the final model to be based on the preferences of 1000 members of the general population. A formula based on the relationship between TTO and BWS values was estimated for a social care QALY, with '0' equivalent to 'being dead' and '1' being the 'ideal' SCRQoL state. Members of the population experienced significantly higher SCRQoL than service users. Conclusions Although further work is needed, particularly to develop an equivalent measure for informal carers and to explore the links with health QALYs, the measure has considerable potential. A number of methodological advances were achieved, including the first application of TTO in a social care context and use of BWS to establish service user preferences.

It has been shown that prosodically packaging together parts of a sentence that are interpreted together facilitates processing of the sentence. This applies not only to explicit prosody but also implicit prosody. The present work hypothesizes that a line break in a written text induces an implicit prosodic break, which, in turn, should result in a processing bias for interpreting English wh-questions. Two experiments – one self-paced reading study and one questionnaire study – are reported. Both supported the “line break” hypothesis mentioned above. The results of the self-paced reading experiment showed that unambiguous wh-questions were read faster when the location of line breaks (or frame breaks) matched the scope of a wh-phrase (main or embedded clause) than when they did not. The questionnaire tested sentences with an ambiguous wh-phrase, one that could attach either to the main or the embedded clause. These sentences were interpreted as attaching to the main clause more often than to the embedded clause when a line break appeared after the main verb, but not when it appeared after the embedded verb.",7,,1465,,Dependent clause; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Verb; Sentence; Sentence processing; Line Break; Questionnaire study; Processing bias; Computer science; Linguistics; Prosody,implicit prosody; inner voice; line breaks; sentence comprehension; sentence processing; silent reading; wh-questions; written text,,,Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,https://jglobal.jst.go.jp/en/detail?JGLOBAL_ID=201902205221600240 https://ir.library.carleton.ca/pub/10489 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01465/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01465/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27774072 https://ir.library.carleton.ca/pub/10489/fpsyg-07-01465.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/87928741 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82866812.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01465,27774072,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.01465,2529078353,PMC5054017,0,000-116-382-329-391; 000-524-259-503-81X; 004-609-665-522-977; 006-715-167-340-822; 007-240-209-763-648; 011-861-960-923-034; 016-220-111-730-424; 019-850-428-870-113; 020-458-084-826-571; 022-841-292-829-413; 031-533-653-211-945; 031-962-159-774-991; 034-068-096-247-23X; 037-411-129-484-317; 044-336-977-912-341; 044-972-124-881-309; 049-673-575-918-037; 054-515-102-791-037; 058-998-549-193-302; 064-650-175-553-51X; 065-919-915-823-091; 071-908-301-398-207; 077-312-935-857-218; 090-154-886-725-058; 104-620-781-341-738; 104-803-992-562-372; 107-365-252-374-626; 111-249-897-552-668; 112-223-809-990-74X; 115-966-294-871-747; 125-126-510-447-82X; 129-562-919-370-975; 137-679-409-557-376; 145-177-048-115-993; 155-893-052-086-531; 159-433-887-234-14X; 169-019-459-551-359; 173-854-419-421-799; 187-566-259-512-211; 189-839-523-413-778,0
039-224-560-064-423,Numerical synesthesia is more than just a symbol-induced phenomenon,2013-11-14,2013,journal article,Frontiers in psychology,16641078,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Limor Gertner; Isabel Arend; Avishai Henik,"Synesthesia is a peculiar condition that involves an atypical binding between two seemingly independent sensory modalities or within the same one. All synesthetic bindings are characterized by an inducing stimulus (i.e., inducer) and a subjective sensation triggered concurrently (i.e., concurrent). Synesthetic inducers can be sensory (e.g., sound) or conceptual (e.g., graphemes, time units) while the concurrent sensation is, in the majority of cases, a sensory one (e.g., smell, touch).; ; In numerical synesthesia, numbers (i.e., inducer) automatically and consistently trigger an ancillary experience of color, texture, spatial location, or personification (i.e., concurrent). For example, for a given synesthete, an audition of the number 5 may trigger a sensation of the color shiny yellow, be mapped on a vertical meridian above four and beneath six in his/her peripersonal space or elicit a cognitive awareness of “a young man, ordinary, and common in his tastes and appearance …” (Simner et al., 2011).; ; Until recently, numerical synesthesia was almost unquestionably viewed as a symbolic-based phenomenon. This was mainly because most synesthetes report their synesthetic experience is elicited solely by symbolic content (i.e., Arabic numbers) but not by non-symbolic ones (i.e., size, quantity) (Cohen Kadosh and Gertner, 2011). Furthermore, some researchers showed that non-symbolic magnitudes (i.e., random clusters of dots) or less familiar symbolic numerals (i.e., Roman numbers) were ineffective in evoking the synesthetic concurrent (Ramachandran and Hubbard, 2001, Experiment 3; Ward and Sagiv, 2007), suggesting that Arabic numbers per se (i.e., their form, ordinality, etc.) and not their semantic meaning or numerosity are the critical factors for inducing synesthetic experience (Hubbard et al., 2009).; ; However, when considering two main findings in the domain of numerical cognition—(a) that symbolic content is intimately associated with non-symbolic dimensions (e.g., size, quantity, brightness) (e.g., Schwarz and Heinze, 1998; Fias et al., 2003; Pinel et al., 2004; Ansari, 2008; Cohen Kadosh et al., 2008a), and (b) that magnitude is assumed to be automatically activated whenever we are presented with numbers (Dehaene et al., 1993; Dehaene and Akhavein, 1995)—one must wonder whether synesthetic experience can also be elicited by different magnitude dimensions.; ; In this opinion paper we present some recent observations from the literature on numerical synesthesia indicating that magnitude representation may play a role in mediating synesthetic effects found under experimental settings. Based on this evidence we suggest that synesthetic experiences induced by numbers may be produced also by non-symbolic magnitudes, due to the cognitive and neuronal overlap of these two dimensions. In other words, we propose that numerical synesthesia is more than a symbol-induced phenomenon per se. Furthermore, we speculate that this suggested association between a non-symbolic inducer and a synesthetic concurrent may manifest at different levels of awareness, resulting in an explicit, reportable experience for some synesthetes but a more non-conscious or implicit representation in others.; ; Before presenting our arguments, it is important to note that we use the phrase “numerical synesthesia” to include the subtypes of synesthesia that share numerical inducers (i.e., number-color and number-space synesthesia). We acknowledge that in spite of a common inducer (i.e., number), different mechanisms may mediate the various inducer-concurrent associations (Novich et al., 2011), yet we argue that both types discussed here illustrate the suggested involvement of magnitude representation in inducing synesthetic concurrents (i.e., color, spatial location).",4,,860,860,Symbol; Sensation; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Numeral system; Stimulus modality; Synesthesia; Numerical cognition; Communication; Arabic numerals,non-symbolic magnitude comparison; number-color synesthesia; number-space synesthesia; numerical cognition; symbolic numbers,,,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24348435 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00860/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00860/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/82849700 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82849700.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00860,24348435,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00860,2168644799,PMC3827548,0,000-495-638-642-502; 000-720-201-572-044; 001-244-253-407-376; 003-756-834-371-246; 004-079-468-869-677; 024-114-150-202-764; 029-241-606-502-92X; 029-671-588-588-052; 029-915-293-337-721; 037-830-415-445-42X; 038-370-615-027-726; 047-571-584-151-480; 060-748-407-187-900; 060-894-660-677-28X; 062-470-916-712-549; 065-432-243-884-865; 069-593-985-303-866; 079-302-318-300-653; 081-959-110-762-240; 088-849-249-876-733; 104-898-249-163-45X; 109-899-292-094-572; 116-953-283-915-381; 140-620-082-925-684; 157-248-771-050-27X,4

A Simple and Effective Approach to Active Preference Learning,2015-02-19,2015,,arXiv: Machine Learning,,,,Lucas Maystre; Matthias Grossglauser,"We address the problem of learning a ranking by using adaptively chosen pairwise comparisons. Our goal is to recover the ranking accurately but to sample the comparisons sparingly. If all comparison outcomes are consistent with the ranking, the optimal solution is to use an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quicksort. But how do sorting algorithms behave if some comparison outcomes are inconsistent with the ranking? We give favorable guarantees for Quicksort for the popular Bradley-Terry model, under natural assumptions on the parameters. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that sorting algorithms lead to a very simple and effective active learning strategy: repeatedly sort the items. This strategy performs as well as state-of-the-art methods (and much better than random sampling) at a minuscule fraction of the computational cost.",,,,,Introsort; Sorting algorithm; Machine learning; Ranking SVM; Artificial intelligence; Preference learning; Hybrid algorithm; Ranking; Quicksort; Computer science; sort,,,,,https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05556 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05556.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1502.05556 https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05556 https://ru.arxiv.org/abs/1502.05556,https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1502.05556,,,2624688904,,0,027-088-240-338-262; 031-830-169-787-740; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-622-562-339-932; 075-376-671-118-947; 081-370-959-105-221; 091-666-780-893-50X; 113-278-954-446-219; 124-130-648-743-168; 141-664-268-210-645; 161-247-307-055-667; 172-520-776-223-903; 181-375-967-075-390; 196-686-533-213-568,4

C. Harrison; Francesco Caprini; Amy Fancourt,"Musical abilities and active engagement with music have been shown to be positively associated with many cognitive abilities as well as social skills and academic performance in secondary school students. While there is evidence from intervention studies that musical training can be a cause of these positive relationships, recent findings in the literature have suggested that other factors, such as genetics, family background or personality traits, might also be contributing factors. In addition, there is mounting evidence that self-concepts and beliefs can affect academic performance independently of intellectual ability. Students who believe that intelligence is malleable are more likely to attribute poor academic performances to effort rather than ability, and are more likely to take remedial action to improve their performance. However, it is currently not known whether student's beliefs about the nature of musical talent also influence the development of musical abilities in a similar fashion. Therefore, this study introduces a short self-report measure termed ""Musical Self-Theories and Goals,"" closely modeled on validated measures for self-theories in academic scenarios. Using this measure the study investigates whether musical self-theories are related to students' musical development as indexed by their concurrent musical activities and their performance on a battery of listening tests. We use data from a cross-sectional sample of 313 secondary school students to construct a network model describing the relationships between self-theories and academic as well as musical outcome measures, while also assessing potential effects of intelligence and the Big Five personality dimensions. Results from the network model indicate that self-theories of intelligence and musicality are closely related. In addition, both kinds of self-theories are connected to the students' academic achievement through the personality dimension conscientiousness and academic effort. Finally, applying the do-calculus method to the network model we estimate that the size of the assumed causal effects between musical self-theories and academic achievement lie between 0.07 and 0.15 standard deviations.",6,,1702,1702,Musicality; Musical development; Psychology; Conscientiousness; Active listening; Cognitive psychology; Personality; Academic achievement; Big Five personality traits; Musical; Social psychology,academic performance; musical ability; personality; self-concepts; theory of intelligence; theory of musicality,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01702/abstract http://research.gold.ac.uk/17200/ http://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/23492 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01702/full https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/23492 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26594189 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26594189/ https://core.ac.uk/display/42388273 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82873856.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01702,26594189,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01702,2125549884,PMC4633492,0,000-360-514-408-29X; 000-361-165-863-036; 004-296-162-639-300; 005-656-005-721-290; 005-937-518-496-560; 009-052-346-337-850; 009-445-825-703-659; 011-125-127-129-740; 011-531-373-317-02X; 013-980-134-326-742; 014-544-247-205-870; 015-430-629-160-920; 016-013-678-756-826; 016-102-112-800-255; 019-153-977-878-747; 020-496-292-347-062; 020-825-780-670-832; 022-146-332-023-453; 022-427-146-749-681; 023-096-350-414-494; 025-374-061-826-484; 025-947-448-229-014; 026-288-647-309-869; 026-959-442-637-273; 028-454-407-476-872; 028-505-400-918-209; 029-213-571-248-301; 029-241-900-138-727; 029-373-804-401-972; 030-635-491-479-818; 033-547-409-976-081; 034-358-215-833-780; 034-591-256-259-667; 035-664-391-494-580; 035-994-985-400-280; 037-585-348-671-833; 038-431-277-031-453; 039-158-645-474-875; 039-843-788-142-697; 041-357-786-190-845; 045-603-304-671-694; 046-695-270-559-350; 046-912-284-300-030; 048-437-563-585-350; 048-776-188-650-080; 048-865-784-262-927; 049-385-043-529-528; 050-644-307-805-442; 052-252-063-293-54X; 055-284-632-827-86X; 055-345-586-188-628; 055-856-681-658-178; 060-248-627-613-421; 060-706-190-453-108; 062-171-526-167-776; 063-870-283-834-413; 064-573-380-653-10X; 064-605-568-407-924; 065-155-166-679-274; 071-785-176-482-436; 073-024-523-668-785; 074-067-983-562-742; 075-299-045-186-719; 075-323-052-789-726; 075-592-151-491-824; 075-762-626-681-517; 076-056-075-050-839; 076-660-840-363-156; 078-712-828-867-444; 091-728-772-982-685; 092-361-093-166-676; 093-855-349-966-279; 094-855-358-428-065; 096-558-181-910-949; 099-772-356-001-568; 108-203-294-988-217; 109-563-099-967-993; 110-483-501-803-299; 110-839-570-102-28X; 113-529-763-832-882; 114-576-352-253-796; 116-224-158-386-273; 118-114-349-964-588; 119-578-238-780-446; 120-905-058-978-931; 121-798-277-347-107; 121-989-576-820-218; 126-601-881-655-683; 129-541-686-523-99X; 132-048-953-520-830; 135-596-178-674-375; 136-479-400-471-602; 138-351-028-496-482; 144-561-338-845-265; 144-566-398-124-905; 151-064-219-452-713; 153-615-435-866-188; 158-146-365-049-707; 162-417-221-546-970; 168-365-136-800-598; 173-756-296-652-562; 196-891-259-696-351; 198-580-939-648-585,16

Holmes; Candelaria Alcat; Stella F. Lourenco,"Accumulating evidence suggests that different magnitudes (e.g., number, size, and duration) are spatialized in the mind according to a common left-right metric, consistent with a generalized system for representing magnitude. A previous study conducted by two of us (Holmes & Lourenco, ) provided evidence that this metric extends to the processing of emotional magnitude, or the intensity of emotion expressed in faces. Recently, however, Pitt and Casasanto () showed that the earlier effects may have been driven by a left-right mapping of mouth size rather than emotional magnitude, and they found no evidence for an emotional magnitude mapping when using words as stimuli. Here, we report two new experiments that further examine these conclusions. In Experiment 1, using face stimuli with mouths occluded, we replicate the original finding: Less emotional faces were associated with the left and more emotional faces with the right. However, we also find that people can reliably infer the sizes of the occluded mouths, and that these inferred mouth sizes can explain the observed left-right mapping. In Experiment 2, we show that comparative judgments of emotional words yield a left-right mapping of emotional magnitude not attributable to stimulus confounds. Based on these findings, we concur with Pitt and Casasanto that faces pose challenges for isolating the forces driving spatialization, but we suggest that emotional magnitude, when assessed using unconfounded stimuli in a sufficiently sensitive task, may indeed be spatialized as originally proposed. Suggestions for further research on the spatialization of emotional magnitude are discussed.",43,4,e12727,,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Spatialization; Replicate; Emotional words; Magnitude (mathematics),Emotion; Faces; General magnitude system; Intensity; Magnitude; Space; Valence; Words,Emotions/physiology; Facial Expression; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time/physiology; Social Perception,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/HOLIEM-3 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31001883 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31001883/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/cogs.12727,31001883,10.1111/cogs.12727,2929347431,,0,001-244-253-407-376; 001-995-708-037-242; 003-756-834-371-246; 004-620-151-855-747; 004-811-983-040-534; 015-264-055-000-686; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-096-212-135-705; 017-482-443-226-618; 029-915-293-337-721; 034-798-899-076-555; 036-436-671-612-600; 038-395-026-012-885; 055-179-738-728-97X; 066-608-905-207-154; 074-017-562-218-104; 082-896-379-655-836; 090-043-017-153-236; 090-989-588-538-874; 093-804-332-695-898; 096-167-391-482-040; 114-587-299-904-10X; 114-992-167-812-755; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-791-951-129-93X; 122-503-390-079-752; 123-593-345-103-90X; 167-275-555-617-549,5

Housel,This study tests a model of how auditors make decisions when presented with environmental risk information in the context of a task that requires their professional opinion on a company's forecasted information. Auditing provided a small-world context where declarative and procedural knowledge have been well documented in terms of the rules for analysing financial information. This research uses a conceptual modelling approach to determine auditors' perceptions of environmental risk information and the effects on their judgement and decision choices when issuing an examination report supporting forecasted financial statements. Auditors were provided with environmental risk information that they had to process and integrate in their decision-making. The results demonstrated that auditors act on unfamiliar declarative knowledge using their standard procedural knowledge.

Food colour affects growth performance and feed efficiency in captive fishes. This study determined the food colour preference of the juveniles of the African catfish Clarias gariepinus under natural light in a roofed hatchery. A group of 20 juveniles were held in a transparent aquarium whose background colour was made white, blue, green, red, or black. The test food was diced shrimp flesh dyed blue, green, red, and yellow, with non-dyed natural flesh as the white control. In the food colour preference test, the catfish were presented the shrimp flesh in a pair of different colours at a time. The colour of the food that was first approached and ingested, i.e., the first response, was recorded. All the 10 possible food colour pairs were tested against five background colours. Quantitative analysis of the frequency of first response was done by χ 2 test and Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment. The juveniles exhibited clear food colour preference that varied with the background colours. Against the black background, the first response was significantly biased to red shrimp flesh. Against the red and blue backgrounds, red and blue shrimp flesh were significantly preferred. Against the white and green backgrounds, no significant color preference was detected. Overall, juvenile African catfish preferred red and blue coloured shrimp flesh. This distinct preference for red and blue food could not be explained by associative learning (brown feed in the hatchery) and seemed innate.",196,,119,122,Juvenile; Flesh; Shrimp; Catfish; Preference test; Hatchery; Clarias gariepinus; Associative learning; Fishery; Biology; Zoology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168159117301909,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.013,,10.1016/j.applanim.2017.06.013,2731508995,,0,003-065-940-585-704; 006-371-595-572-72X; 006-440-548-863-192; 006-604-218-915-664; 017-021-238-144-697; 019-834-072-055-141; 026-929-229-413-265; 033-187-834-898-030; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-694-383-100-254; 041-017-007-630-207; 044-119-351-811-978; 048-918-633-434-396; 055-752-584-530-635; 058-729-264-307-921; 063-115-307-278-492; 067-670-418-864-273; 070-703-003-345-62X; 070-836-067-442-241; 091-311-484-321-90X; 098-791-853-755-819; 100-558-026-818-774; 103-793-866-418-756; 105-167-210-667-906; 112-643-193-320-799; 121-268-223-896-532; 125-377-880-109-437; 126-605-607-340-695; 134-685-400-672-505; 139-816-385-016-815; 155-246-484-983-85X; 198-144-869-311-053,6

More specifically, the paper makes use of the three-step structuring process for decision analysis proposed by von Winterfeldt and Edwards: (1) identifying the problem; (2) selecting an appropriate analytic approach; and (3) developing a detailed analytic structure. For illustration of the approach a case study dealing with the assessment task of prioritising and selecting initiatives and projects from a public pool with limited funds is examined throughout the paper. The process is embedded in a Decision Support System (DSS) making use of the REMBRANDT technique for pair wise comparisons to determine project rankings. A procedure for limiting the number of pair wise comparisons to be made in the process is in this connection presented.

The conventional methods for landfill location selection are insufficient in dealing with the vague or imprecise nature of linguistic assessment. To resolve this problem, fuzzy multi-criteria decision-making methods are proposed. The aim of this paper is to use fuzzy TODIM (the acronym for Interactive and Multi-criteria Decision Making in Portuguese) and the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (AHP) methods for the selection of landfill location. The proposed methods have been applied to a landfill location selection problem in the region of Casablanca, Morocco. After determining the criteria affecting the landfill location decisions, fuzzy TODIM and fuzzy AHP methods are applied to the problem and results are presented. The comparisons of these two methods are also discussed.",5,1,501,501,Decision problem; Fuzzy ahp; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Computer science; Operations research; Acronym; Fuzzy logic; Analytic hierarchy process,Fuzzy AHP; Fuzzy TODIM; Fuzzy logic; Landfill location selection; Multi-criteria decision-making,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4840156/ https://springerplus.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7?site=springerplus.springeropen.com https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40064-016-2131-7.pdf https://paperity.org/p/76108005/comparison-of-fuzzy-ahp-and-fuzzy-todim-methods-for-landfill-location-selection https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7/fulltext.html http://www.europepmc.org/articles/PMC4840156/ https://core.ac.uk/display/81799245 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1352648 https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81799245.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7,27186465,10.1186/s40064-016-2131-7,2336151868,PMC4840156,0,000-757-628-055-635; 001-612-402-730-721; 001-900-923-122-330; 003-923-798-610-339; 004-416-042-228-930; 004-819-428-856-290; 006-758-369-093-807; 008-242-824-275-246; 010-812-941-614-60X; 013-456-459-335-267; 014-021-360-826-246; 015-997-067-308-854; 018-379-525-070-195; 022-654-238-488-79X; 026-313-648-343-737; 030-733-094-692-470; 031-072-952-164-748; 032-387-051-753-644; 037-423-792-391-123; 039-765-131-976-418; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-171-037-578-472; 047-307-709-087-863; 047-660-487-387-971; 047-922-814-401-177; 057-103-896-997-894; 057-655-655-087-30X; 058-920-486-630-498; 062-224-203-288-174; 062-407-000-882-335; 066-234-121-638-585; 067-330-182-546-592; 067-341-125-020-782; 068-136-369-828-781; 069-604-346-895-747; 071-501-420-538-845; 073-668-641-516-145; 074-275-760-092-743; 078-946-939-736-414; 087-072-202-288-583; 091-337-456-604-457; 091-643-286-863-370; 093-585-771-535-506; 097-063-573-866-90X; 100-805-428-454-315; 102-756-897-401-245; 104-452-245-564-161; 105-027-020-577-526; 105-969-007-133-006; 110-256-835-399-177; 110-428-718-074-769; 113-902-896-993-383; 115-485-666-354-146; 126-815-650-179-433; 128-811-108-734-374; 131-161-724-039-419; 138-076-088-924-369; 140-392-610-070-682; 144-321-733-210-734; 148-797-443-547-004; 150-148-618-415-700; 151-944-928-203-563; 156-536-382-034-719; 157-906-843-361-31X; 158-435-536-678-358; 162-905-963-707-852; 170-523-633-086-199; 176-034-938-020-693; 187-509-726-412-009,26

Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Paul C. Price; Nicole M. Kimura; Andrew R. Smith; Lindsay D. Marshall,"Previous research has shown that people exhibit a sample size bias when judging the average of a set of stimuli on a single dimension. The more stimuli there are in the set, the greater people judge the average to be. This effect has been demonstrated reliably for judgments of the average likelihood that groups of people will experience negative, positive, and neutral events (Price, 2001; Price, Smith, & Lench, 2006)and also for estimates of the mean of sets of numbers (Smith & Price, 2010). The present research focuses on whether this effect is observed for judgments of average on a perceptual dimension. In 5 experiments we show that people’s judgments of the average size of the squares in a set increase as the number of squares in the set increases. This effect occurs regardless of whether the squares in each set are presentedsimultaneously or sequentially; whether the squares in each set are different sizes or all the same size; and whether the response is a rating of size, an estimate of area, or a comparative judgment. These results are consistent with a priming account of the sample size bias, in which the sample size activates arepresentation of magnitude that directly biases the judgment of average.",40,5,1321,1331,Statistics; Sample size determination; Psychology; Cognition; Visual perception; Perception; Poison control; Priming (psychology); Magnitude (mathematics); Robust statistics,,Attention/physiology; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Photic Stimulation; Probability; Sample Size; Size Perception/physiology,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24749965 http://www.appstate.edu/~smithar3/articles/Price_et_al-2014-Perceptual_averages.pdf https://www.learntechlib.org/p/160943/share https://www.learntechlib.org/p/160943/ https://libres.uncg.edu/ir/asu/listing.aspx?id=19449 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1057443,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0036576,24749965,10.1037/a0036576,2022258332,,0,003-103-431-474-664; 005-768-129-737-362; 014-175-100-464-076; 016-227-375-936-145; 018-051-287-827-615; 020-328-989-578-60X; 024-306-285-412-917; 024-595-422-424-118; 028-183-827-153-760; 035-143-942-540-296; 038-395-026-012-885; 040-269-259-341-705; 042-740-819-358-295; 048-924-036-705-953; 051-401-883-099-064; 052-441-952-615-003; 053-399-987-654-061; 059-975-734-862-12X; 063-793-155-762-965; 075-731-589-633-142; 078-474-590-257-88X; 078-479-099-650-852; 080-287-610-251-548; 104-898-249-163-45X; 107-854-421-865-889; 111-265-079-047-31X; 120-204-913-104-353; 122-201-974-023-37X; 126-930-373-221-974; 129-827-356-327-594; 147-279-280-835-709,10

Beer; David S. Chester; Brent L. Hughes,"Abstract Has self-enhancement been too heavily emphasized as a motivating factor in social comparisons? Recently, researchers have argued that some types of social-comparative judgments may differ in important ways from other self-evaluative phenomena typically offered as evidence of self-enhancement motivation. In contrast to a large body of research showing that self-esteem threat affects other self-evaluative processes, the literature remains silent on how self-esteem threat affects social comparisons between self and an average peer. Furthermore, whereas social comparisons appear to be self-favoring (i.e. ‘better than average’) in many domains, they are predictably self-deprecating (i.e., ‘worse than average’) in others. As a result, recent models of social-comparative judgment posit that cognitive efficiency, rather than self-enhancement, may more typically account for the manner in which people compare themselves to peers. The current research addresses this controversy by investigating how the tension between self-enhancement and need for cognitive efficiency is resolved in social comparison. Two experiments examined the crossed effects of self-esteem threat and cognitive load on social comparisons of personality traits (Experiment 1) and likelihood of future events (Experiment 2a–b). Both self-esteem threat and cognitive load increased the self-favoring nature of social comparisons including those otherwise characterized by self-deprecation. The findings show that self-enhancement does significantly influence social comparison with peers and, in fact, most parsimoniously accounts for these social-comparative judgments when cognitive resources are limited. Furthermore, self-deprecating social comparisons are attenuated in the face of self-esteem threat and, therefore, do not provide a substantial challenge to the role of self-enhancement in social comparison.",49,4,706,711,Cognitive resource theory; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Self-enhancement; Self-esteem; Big Five personality traits; Self deprecation; Cognitive load; Social psychology; Social cognition,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002210311300053X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.017,,10.1016/j.jesp.2013.02.017,2136667832,,0,003-258-105-238-013; 005-553-153-856-945; 008-431-264-895-983; 012-419-306-168-454; 015-313-050-467-541; 015-691-727-300-523; 019-464-159-707-530; 020-419-379-272-121; 021-740-218-019-640; 028-633-799-586-379; 031-672-019-523-79X; 034-166-452-633-508; 036-862-088-802-679; 039-044-601-310-689; 039-449-261-362-065; 043-935-327-751-230; 050-022-088-568-865; 057-282-335-615-805; 062-022-911-967-711; 063-325-395-878-388; 064-169-233-606-050; 065-688-149-501-185; 071-431-768-982-102; 071-637-558-385-75X; 073-798-217-206-223; 075-061-020-174-463; 080-649-347-048-061; 082-662-120-833-072; 088-666-654-739-335; 096-792-630-788-615; 097-702-087-584-622; 103-787-390-665-573; 109-760-962-476-435; 110-386-797-414-836; 114-590-207-496-477; 134-492-987-292-729; 138-125-904-381-699; 148-223-435-969-407; 152-493-150-029-758; 156-616-292-247-526; 167-230-937-189-317; 173-390-710-223-111; 181-166-614-027-51X,24

Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Katja Corcoran; Kai Epstude; Lysann Damisch; Thomas Mussweiler,"People constantly have to make efficient use of their limited cognitive resources. Recently, T. Mussweiler and K. Epstude (2009) demonstrated that comparative thinking simplifies information processing and increases the efficiency of judgment. However, there are different types of comparative thinking. While comparing 2 entities, people may focus on either similarities or dissimilarities between target and standard. The authors propose that these 2 comparative thinking styles differ in their efficiency. Specifically, the authors hypothesize that comparisons with a focus on similarities lead to more focused information processing and faster judgments than comparisons with a dissimilarity focus. In line with these hypotheses, the authors demonstrate that participants are indeed faster at judging the similarity of 2 stimuli (Study 1) and that they search for less target information in a comparative judgment task (Study 2) if they focus on similarities rather than dissimilarities. Focusing on similarities thus appears to be the more efficient comparative thinking style.",37,5,1280,1286,Cognitive resource theory; Cognitive style; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Conceptual combination; Thinking skills; Assimilation (phonology); Social psychology; Information processing,,"Analysis of Variance; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Mental Recall/physiology; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Students; Thinking/physiology; Universities",,European Science Foundation,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21707213 https://www.rug.nl/research/portal/en/publications/fast-similarities(7d8a46c1-d71a-458d-b811-0d090b356634).html http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0023922 https://core.ac.uk/display/148236997 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.rug.nl%3Apublications%2F25aabd26-676a-444a-9985-885f08b1adaf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ945330 http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/fast_similarities_-_efficiency_advantages_of_similarity-focused_comparisons.pdf https://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0023922,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0023922,21707213,10.1037/a0023922,2030343577,,0,001-682-322-425-878; 002-859-126-526-281; 006-709-435-342-031; 006-827-050-668-134; 007-002-863-763-665; 022-817-416-915-787; 023-302-949-320-253; 026-078-481-455-595; 029-091-639-120-134; 031-836-398-929-308; 034-660-938-108-643; 037-900-263-203-114; 040-464-529-994-09X; 041-452-323-177-957; 041-472-632-336-42X; 041-762-629-780-98X; 042-409-780-248-530; 045-898-374-016-004; 051-329-397-927-297; 054-748-247-945-380; 058-439-300-602-587; 059-099-350-871-388; 064-456-199-498-915; 066-550-373-156-464; 068-978-860-714-320; 069-875-059-782-816; 070-310-665-962-718; 080-045-639-939-15X; 080-840-720-981-411; 085-487-428-282-784; 088-801-352-707-919; 090-023-370-872-145; 098-022-154-748-39X; 098-533-377-871-349; 106-820-254-065-793; 108-903-956-505-657; 121-853-096-503-528; 127-150-330-961-234; 142-942-676-497-976; 148-223-435-969-407; 180-816-675-714-917,13

In numerical cognition, the ordinal-cardinal distinction has been scarcely addressed, whereas the size-magnitude distinction has been studied extensively, with the surprising demonstration of an interaction between semantic magnitude and physical size (Besner & Coltheart, 1979). The present work used coins to study the intricate relations between these meanings. In two experiments, Israeli observers (Experiment 1) and American observers (Experiment 2) performed numerical and physical comparative judgments of coins. Consensual markers of magnitude activation (e.g., the size congruity effect and the distance effect) were obtained. The results of the two experiments converged on the same conclusions. Comparisons of value were governed by ordinal magnitude. Magnitude interfered with comparisons of size, but size did not affect value. The results provided a set of clear dissociations between cardinal and ordinal magnitude and between value and size of coins. They highlight the important role played by ordinal information in magnitude processing.",17,6,889,894,Statistics; Psychology; Magnitude processing; Distance effect; Numerical cognition; Dissociation (neuropsychology); Magnitude (mathematics); Ordinal number,,Humans; Judgment; Mathematics; Photic Stimulation; Size Perception; Time Factors,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/PBR.17.6.889 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-2262782071/dissociating-between-cardinal-and-ordinal-and-between http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21169585 https://paperity.org/p/10227156/dissociating-between-cardinal-and-ordinal-and-between-the-value-and-size-magnitudes-of,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/pbr.17.6.889,21169585,10.3758/pbr.17.6.889,2060237678,,0,000-040-572-921-961; 000-554-668-882-790; 003-375-024-877-035; 014-304-423-897-683; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-925-668-440-954; 016-227-375-936-145; 019-777-112-821-405; 035-402-974-768-248; 041-564-846-407-535; 041-744-175-231-513; 048-929-605-184-493; 060-778-427-738-113; 061-665-841-149-002; 085-325-978-974-863; 086-214-041-467-250; 088-849-249-876-733; 090-872-228-365-667; 112-094-327-005-665; 124-257-870-583-335; 137-692-088-641-994; 175-397-495-157-485,12

Gilmore; Matthew Inglis; Ian Jones,"The importance of improving students’ understanding of core concepts in mathematics is well established. However, assessing the impact of different teaching interventions designed to improve students’ conceptual understanding requires the validation of adequate measures. Here we propose a novel method of measuring conceptual understanding based on comparative judgement (CJ). Contrary to traditional instruments, the CJ approach allows test questions for any topic to be developed rapidly. In addition, CJ does not require a detailed rubric to represent conceptual understanding of a topic, as it is instead based on the collective knowledge of experts. In the current studies, we compared CJ to already established instruments to measure three topics in mathematics: understanding the use of p-values in statistics, understanding derivatives in calculus, and understanding the use of letters in algebra. The results showed that CJ was valid as compared to established instruments, and achieved high reliability. We conclude that CJ is a quick and efficient alternative method of measuring conceptual understanding in mathematics and could therefore be particularly useful in intervention studies.",2,2,141,164,Rubric; Psychology; Judgement; Alternative methods; Intervention studies; Management science; Collective intelligence,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9368609 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/11972 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40753-016-0024-3.pdf https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/20444 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3 https://paperity.org/p/76526064/measuring-conceptual-understanding-using-comparative-judgement https://www.rasch.org.uk/assets/papers/9/cj.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9368609 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42484555.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3,,10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3,2293494073,,0,004-257-050-498-919; 017-720-121-667-139; 019-372-839-061-325; 020-097-247-590-604; 020-326-308-142-423; 021-386-533-570-898; 025-815-512-671-284; 026-126-511-819-948; 026-140-166-599-34X; 027-043-806-375-152; 033-896-251-435-132; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-995-191-505-48X; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 059-517-253-696-88X; 066-908-670-161-319; 078-596-058-399-553; 091-354-181-661-739; 103-589-015-928-645; 106-166-641-836-689; 109-604-178-712-209; 122-718-932-710-050; 136-468-250-342-464; 179-817-776-513-638; 197-534-306-708-732,11

Experiment 1 used comparative judgment of numerals, and it was found that in physical comparisons (e.g., 3-5 vs. 3-5) the dyscalculia group showed a significantly smaller congruity effect than did the dyslexia and the control groups. Experiment 2 used Navon figures (D. Navon, 1977) in Hebrew, and participants were asked to name the large or the small letters. Phoneme similarity modulated performance of the control and the dyscalculia groups and showed a very small effect in the dyslexia group. This suggests that the dyscalculia population has difficulties in automatically associating numerals with magnitudes but no problems in associating letters with phonemes, whereas the dyslexia population shows the opposite pattern.",98,4,854,867,Developmental psychology; Association (psychology); Learning disability; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Acalculia; Dyscalculia; Population; Developmental Dyscalculia; Dyslexia; Dissociation (neuropsychology),,,,,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2006-21055-014 http://langnum.haifa.ac.il/articles/rubin/Double%20dissociation%20of%20functions%20in%20developmental%20dyslexia%20and%20dyscalculia.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5887838 http://doi.apa.org/journals/edu/98/4/854.html https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ746514,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-0663.98.4.854,,10.1037/0022-0663.98.4.854,2132667131,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 000-850-020-577-511; 001-244-253-407-376; 001-350-521-339-47X; 004-088-951-403-791; 004-335-435-517-755; 005-552-384-721-816; 006-335-327-688-066; 007-396-120-137-676; 008-814-726-817-823; 009-513-242-292-757; 010-740-008-133-649; 012-451-202-559-768; 013-621-298-749-675; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-074-345-874-333; 018-519-312-543-325; 018-625-858-864-445; 019-777-112-821-405; 019-860-778-949-357; 021-044-935-314-440; 021-390-249-913-568; 021-802-455-857-69X; 022-098-618-753-271; 023-061-745-833-650; 024-843-824-931-155; 025-902-904-052-699; 027-609-082-104-508; 029-660-290-040-509; 029-899-356-397-821; 031-541-539-785-70X; 034-499-549-109-767; 035-749-101-191-438; 037-054-632-717-760; 041-091-026-773-241; 043-170-720-788-118; 043-555-151-912-525; 047-949-982-406-946; 048-830-545-060-535; 048-917-364-533-710; 049-578-805-420-248; 050-445-728-339-345; 050-926-272-253-558; 051-456-721-176-715; 052-281-268-279-613; 053-754-170-312-538; 055-026-521-300-430; 055-263-793-850-099; 057-115-550-640-095; 057-641-100-487-003; 060-290-302-293-721; 060-645-206-905-070; 060-748-407-187-900; 061-170-893-361-027; 062-656-252-133-557; 062-691-052-997-020; 063-314-964-834-008; 063-613-578-276-837; 064-385-111-633-946; 066-089-489-617-442; 067-120-322-451-291; 067-402-786-755-256; 067-583-756-505-85X; 072-519-846-908-69X; 072-812-190-202-696; 073-116-718-209-499; 078-677-734-349-776; 078-699-018-002-285; 079-215-076-003-684; 079-224-041-509-479; 083-665-507-689-714; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-849-249-876-733; 091-944-102-337-296; 104-898-249-163-45X; 109-899-292-094-572; 116-057-314-572-751; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-172-224-687-037; 117-752-793-668-902; 122-092-984-924-278; 123-237-690-393-097; 133-955-649-624-278; 136-396-369-365-647; 138-607-199-904-731; 148-043-544-952-446; 151-343-736-115-258; 155-991-294-360-264; 160-243-638-226-569; 177-015-691-281-199; 183-534-006-641-347; 187-510-755-292-489; 189-964-429-526-197; 191-992-821-981-194,71
040-636-934-574-740,The perception of gloss: A review,2014-11-08,2014,journal article,Vision research,18785646; 00426989,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,A.C. Chadwick; Robert W. Kentridge,"Gloss is a relatively little studied visual property of objects’ surfaces. The earliest recorded scientific reference to gloss appears to have been by Ingersoll in 1921: studies at this time were based on the assumption that gloss could be understood as an inherent physical property of a surface, and the priority was to devise a satisfactory method and scale to measure it reliably. As awareness of the complexity of perception grew, efforts were made to distinguish different types of gloss, although these generally still took the form of a search for objective physical measures to be solved within the visual system by means of inverse optics. It became more widely recognised approximately 20 years ago that models of gloss perception based on inverse optics were intractable and failed to explain experimental findings adequately. A temporary decline in the number of published studies followed; however the last decade or so has seen a renewal of interest in the perception of gloss, in an effort to map what is now understood to be a complex interaction of variables including illumination, surface properties and observer. This appears to have been driven by a number of factors, as the study of gloss re-emerged from research into other surface properties such as colour and texture, with technological advances paving the way for new experimental techniques and measurements. This review describes the main strands of research, tracking the changes in approach and theory which have triggered new avenues of research, to the current state of knowledge.",109,,221,235,Cognitive psychology; Perception; Gloss (annotation); Visual property; Computer science; Observer (quantum physics),Gloss; Materials; Perception; Vision,"Cues; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Psychophysics; Surface Properties; Visual Perception/physiology",,"Durham University and Procter & Gamble, Technical Centres",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698914002594 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/15559/ https://core.ac.uk/display/42126624 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448119 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698914002594 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82392312.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2014.10.026,25448119,10.1016/j.visres.2014.10.026,2057788268,,1,000-889-285-212-68X; 001-060-521-763-259; 001-281-280-236-499; 001-740-766-105-501; 002-235-282-611-87X; 004-273-381-418-960; 005-106-437-816-609; 005-594-408-235-94X; 010-440-297-837-137; 011-231-961-118-102; 011-554-784-863-502; 012-415-225-403-397; 014-136-157-239-951; 014-617-435-588-906; 014-678-747-012-753; 014-959-595-091-886; 015-059-238-164-963; 015-356-781-115-89X; 015-377-641-815-870; 016-407-932-485-93X; 016-909-110-659-726; 017-440-219-046-764; 019-611-258-648-73X; 019-675-775-690-824; 020-227-716-553-279; 022-686-731-308-250; 024-008-016-105-729; 025-962-850-904-466; 029-036-998-845-637; 029-682-934-418-755; 030-945-177-930-272; 031-099-917-394-118; 033-544-571-821-842; 033-785-715-909-067; 034-055-612-612-932; 036-222-477-471-353; 037-294-563-396-758; 038-730-238-120-592; 040-617-022-137-579; 043-102-304-781-051; 043-270-431-809-670; 044-659-581-120-248; 044-838-921-044-899; 047-830-189-254-889; 048-647-652-745-657; 051-099-535-076-304; 051-971-676-538-516; 053-849-676-025-706; 054-631-058-087-998; 055-329-988-615-426; 059-164-060-943-724; 060-963-638-617-762; 061-878-397-223-77X; 062-214-408-732-33X; 063-477-238-634-497; 069-640-089-256-765; 069-669-678-660-968; 070-891-514-486-548; 073-055-423-181-218; 074-247-831-141-269; 076-205-948-665-880; 079-194-398-896-999; 084-149-492-732-884; 084-173-407-708-805; 090-407-633-886-77X; 095-587-847-736-219; 096-922-153-864-285; 098-469-909-527-853; 102-568-007-518-006; 104-610-593-352-254; 109-163-419-534-466; 116-036-012-870-072; 116-210-576-740-805; 117-724-967-342-710; 117-953-750-568-451; 144-477-353-644-523; 150-025-633-144-240; 152-138-932-463-878; 154-466-203-098-861; 156-180-185-089-062; 157-577-491-411-621; 161-021-076-909-95X; 171-155-037-102-80X; 180-026-374-133-231; 185-333-747-621-492,60

These are effective to measure teachers’ reasoning but are inadequate to measure noticing in an uninfluenced way. Video-based comparative judgement (CJ) is presented as a holistic alternative to measure teachers’ noticing. This study investigates the validity of a CJ misfit measure as an indicator of teachers’ noticing.

Drawing on the inclusion/exclusion model (Schwarz & Bless, 2007), the authors argue that (a) a recently observed athlete endorser impacts consumer judgment of subsequently presented endorsers, and (b) the valence of the impact depends on brand category membership of the consecutively presented endorsers. A 2 (representative endorser activation: present vs. absent) × 2 (brand category membership: membership vs. nonmembership) between-subjects design was administered across three experiments. Results demonstrated that the presence of a representative endorser increased a subsequently presented endorser’s perceived expertise when that subsequent endorser represented the same brand category.

041-233-921-657-387,Comparative Expectations,2014-08-01,2014,journal article,Studia Logica,00393215; 15728730,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Netherlands,Arthur Paul Pedersen,"I introduce a mathematical account of expectation based on a qualitative criterion of coherence for qualitative comparisons between gambles (or random quantities). The qualitative comparisons may be interpreted as an agent's comparative preference judgments over options or more directly as an agent's comparative expectation judgments over random quantities. The criterion of coherence is reminiscent of de Finetti's quantitative criterion of coherence for betting, yet it does not impose an Archimedean condition on an agent's comparative judgments, it does not require the binary relation reflecting an agent's comparative judgments to be reflexive, complete or even transitive, and it applies to an absolutely arbitrary collection of gambles, free of structural conditions (e.g., closure, measurability, etc.). Moreover, unlike de Finetti's criterion of coherence, the qualitative criterion respects the principle of weak dominance, a standard of rational decision making that obliges an agent to reject a gamble that is possibly worse and certainly no better than another gamble available for choice. Despite these weak assumptions, I establish a qualitative analogue of de Finetti's Fundamental Theorem of Prevision, from which it follows that any coherent system of comparative expectations can be extended to a weakly ordered coherent system of comparative expectations over any collection of gambles containing the initial set of gambles of interest. The extended weakly ordered coherent system of comparative expectations satisfies familiar additivity and scale invariance postulates (i.e., independence) when the extended collection forms a linear space. In the course of these developments, I recast de Finetti's quantitative account of coherent prevision in the qualitative framework adopted in this article. I show that comparative previsions satisfy qualitative analogues of de Finetti's famous bookmaking theorem and his Fundamental Theorem of Prevision.; ; The results of this article complement those of another article (Pedersen, Strictly coherent preferences, no holds barred, Manuscript, 2013). I explain how those results entail that any coherent weakly ordered system of comparative expectations over a unital linear space can be represented by an expectation function taking values in a (possibly non-Archimedean) totally ordered field extension of the system of real numbers. The ordered field extension consists of formal power series in a single infinitesimal, a natural and economical representation that provides a relief map tracing numerical non-Archimedean features to qualitative non-Archimedean features.",102,4,811,848,Ordered field; Mathematical economics; Transitive relation; Fundamental theorem; Representation theorem; Hahn embedding theorem; Decision theory; Mathematics; Binary relation; Infinitesimal,,,,,http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2663076,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11225-013-9539-7,,10.1007/s11225-013-9539-7,2911234257,,0,002-554-544-390-965; 006-806-086-620-72X; 006-809-372-314-962; 008-816-601-485-22X; 008-933-947-544-269; 010-845-810-303-837; 010-859-536-703-180; 013-219-547-022-800; 019-935-736-230-209; 021-163-793-684-308; 024-666-159-312-500; 026-425-111-103-30X; 029-380-883-238-338; 032-015-209-258-882; 032-470-970-362-57X; 035-298-452-403-519; 037-969-757-518-592; 038-773-630-046-462; 043-449-519-880-885; 049-839-479-315-84X; 051-937-143-545-693; 051-951-361-557-458; 057-770-684-695-842; 069-116-352-855-263; 071-333-783-733-957; 082-908-765-687-022; 084-751-768-312-744; 086-769-316-925-88X; 087-452-135-414-846; 088-861-135-379-896; 091-464-448-204-981; 092-630-953-307-735; 098-554-727-267-065; 098-795-100-311-242; 101-951-194-986-782; 103-311-465-611-403; 103-681-234-159-155; 105-384-480-257-115; 111-989-844-690-489; 129-716-385-948-240; 136-215-409-144-65X; 149-990-979-881-650; 161-072-412-154-26X; 162-111-056-207-454; 171-937-021-727-457; 175-923-966-544-121; 186-694-920-902-061; 191-043-723-272-664; 191-504-430-049-45X; 196-393-219-430-629; 196-752-561-267-89X; 198-784-306-702-558,7

Murrell,"The relationship between autobiographical memory, depression and quality of life (QoL) was investigated in a study of 30 persons with severe neurodisability resulting from multiple sclerosis. Sixty percent (n = 18) of patients were found to have deficits in autobiographical memory (AMI) for incidents in their earlier life; these deficits were associated with significant impairments in personal semantic memory of facts from their past life. Patients with impaired autobiographical memory who had been diagnosed for longer than 21 years reported significantly better QoL (SF-36: Role Physical) than those diagnosed more recently, or those with normal autobiographical memory; patients who had been diagnosed for longer were also significantly less depressed than patients diagnosed more recently. Patients with normal autobiographical memory reported the highest levels of depression (HADS) and the lowest levels of QoL (Role Physical). It is concluded that impairment of autobiographical memory affects perception of QoL; patients with deficits in autobiographical memory had impaired knowledge about their past QoL and may therefore be unable to make valid comparative judgements about the quality of their present life.",22,1,125,131,Quality of life; Psychiatry; Autobiographical memory; Psychology; Semantic memory; Perception; Memory disorder; Cognitive disorder; Multiple sclerosis; Neurodisability,,Adult; Aged; Depressive Disorder/diagnosis; Disability Evaluation; Female; Humans; Life Change Events; Male; Mental Recall; Middle Aged; Multiple Sclerosis/diagnosis; Quality of Life; Sick Role,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1076/1380-3395(200002)22:1;1-8;FT125 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10649551,http://dx.doi.org/10.1076/1380-3395(200002)22:1;1-8;ft125,10649551,10.1076/1380-3395(200002)22:1;1-8;ft125,2091350450,,0,,32

Kaas; Rainer Goebel; Avishai Henik; Alexander T. Sack,"People suffering from developmental dyscalculia encounter difficulties in automatically accessing numerical magnitudes [1-3]. For example, when instructed to attend to the physical size of a number while ignoring its numerical value, dyscalculic subjects, unlike healthy participants, fail to process the irrelevant dimension automatically and subsequently show a smaller size-congruity effect (difference in reaction time between incongruent [e.g., a physically large 2 and a physically small 4] and congruent [e.g., a physically small 2 and a physically large 4] conditions), and no facilitation (neutral [e.g., a physically small 2 and a physically large 2] versus congruent) [3]. Previous imaging studies determined the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) as a central area for numerical processing [4-11]. A few studies tried to identify the brain dysfunction underlying developmental dyscalculia but yielded mixed results regarding the involvement of the left [12] or the right [13] IPS. Here we applied fMRI-guided TMS neuronavigation to disrupt left- or right-IPS activation clusters in order to induce dyscalculic-like behavioral deficits in healthy volunteers. Automatic magnitude processing was impaired only during disruption of right-IPS activity. When using the identical paradigm with dyscalculic participants, we reproduced a result pattern similar to that obtained with nondyscalculic volunteers during right-IPS disruption. These findings provide direct evidence for the functional role of right IPS in automatic magnitude processing.",17,8,689,693,Facilitation; Neuroscience; Parietal lobe; Neuronavigation; Intraparietal sulcus; Dyscalculia; Developmental Dyscalculia; Magnitude processing; Brain dysfunction; Biology,,Adult; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematics; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Reaction Time; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207010652 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379521 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Acris.maastrichtuniversity.nl%3Apublications%2Fce2b3646-cef9-43e6-b88f-0289852e2a2e https://www.cell.com/current-biology/pdf/S0960-9822(07)01065-2.pdf https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/244594 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/2870/ https://dissem.in/p/11818578/virtual-dyscalculia-induced-by-parietal-lobe-tms-impairs-automatic-magnitude-processing https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207010652 http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/812053/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.056 https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822(07)01065-2 https://cris.maastrichtuniversity.nl/en/publications/virtual-dyscalculia-induced-by-parietal-lobe-tms-impairs-automati https://www.cell.com/current-biology/supplemental/S0960-9822(07)01065-2 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17379521 https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/244594 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82148350.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.056,17379521,10.1016/j.cub.2007.02.056,2132773392,,0,001-244-253-407-376; 002-949-355-564-360; 003-770-355-599-500; 007-396-120-137-676; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-320-830-897-747; 018-369-525-084-395; 023-335-866-068-946; 023-351-525-370-055; 028-617-436-328-143; 028-908-173-804-813; 030-665-044-131-315; 031-842-221-342-270; 033-039-347-567-168; 033-527-001-452-462; 033-843-519-722-206; 033-987-957-285-504; 037-054-632-717-760; 040-870-485-946-240; 046-313-665-115-379; 050-926-272-253-558; 051-456-721-176-715; 057-877-558-474-926; 059-424-379-092-456; 059-734-653-124-339; 060-206-521-997-513; 060-748-407-187-900; 061-503-605-759-480; 062-470-916-712-549; 063-314-964-834-008; 063-935-737-944-84X; 066-089-489-617-442; 071-879-952-650-138; 072-157-343-216-127; 080-227-732-765-024; 080-688-461-717-355; 081-070-226-181-206; 087-428-674-231-07X; 087-523-328-371-77X; 088-849-249-876-733; 089-161-519-736-812; 089-296-758-081-209; 091-797-704-790-111; 100-067-080-426-062; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-650-685-401-668; 114-289-292-312-317; 116-552-555-760-516; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-752-793-668-902; 120-891-934-941-617; 133-198-124-290-134; 148-043-544-952-446; 157-123-958-831-931; 187-510-755-292-489,174

According to realism, political philosophy must reveal the specific standards internal to the political practice of handling power appropriately and as it develops in actual circumstances. Framed in those terms, the debate evokes the idea that political power itself is lacking normativity until such time as norms are devised that govern its use. In contrast, this essay identifies a normative dimension internal to (the conquest and exercise of) power. Power depends on recognition and support in the form of belief.

It is motivated by policy problems. New causal parameters are defined and identified to address specific policy problems. Economists embrace a scientific approach to causality and model the preferences and choices of agents to infer subjective (agent) evaluations as well as objective outcomes. Anticipated and realized subjective and objective outcomes are distinguished. Models for simultaneous causality are developed.

However, developments in the physical simulation of clinical environments offer exciting, but relatively underexploited, opportunities for exploring nurses' judgements. Critical event risk assessment is an element of acute care practice which lends itself well to simulation and in which more clinical experience is often assumed to lead to better quality judgements. Objectives To model nurses' judgements of critical event risk using physical and paper simulation and to examine whether improving fidelity via physical clinical simulation impacts on the apparent benefits of clinical experience on nurses' judgement performance. Design A comparative clinical judgement analysis. Setting A university in Northern England. Methods Sixty-three nursing students and 34 experienced nurses made dichotomous risk assessment judgements (""at risk"" or ""not at risk"") in response to 25 paper and physical simulated scenarios. These were randomly generated from a dataset of real patient case records. Clinical outcomes (the judgement criteria) for a ‘correct' judgement were derived from the same case records. Logistic regression models were constructed to derive statistics for each nurse representing various measures of judgement performance: achievement ( r a ), consistency ( R s ) and clinical information use ( G ). These statistics were known as Lens Model statistics (from the psychological theory of Brunswik's Lens Model of judgement). Performance measures for novice and experienced nurses were compared. Results No significant differences in judgemental achievement ( r a ) between experienced nurses and students were observed in either paper or high fidelity clinical simulations. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the nurses' abilities to correctly match the ways they synthesised clinical information with the optimum synthesis required by the task (policy matching) ( G ). When faced with ""paper patients"" experienced nurses exercised more cognitive control/consistency ( R s ) than students ( P =0.04). However, this heightened control in experienced nurses was absent when those same nurses made judgements in the higher fidelity clinical simulation environment. Conclusion Clinical experience made no difference to nurses' judgement achievement (accuracy) in either the lower fidelity paper scenarios or the higher fidelity setting of the clinical simulation unit. The significant impact of clinical experience on judgement consistency was negated by the increases in fidelity offered through clinical simulation.",48,4,429,437,Risk assessment; Logistic regression; Cognition; Fidelity; Judgement; Acute care; Psychological Theory; Medicine; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Simulated patient,,England; Nurses; Risk Assessment,,,https://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489(10)00311-1/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20943223 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748910003111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.09.010,20943223,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.09.010,2012469528,,0,000-645-751-448-200; 001-136-720-724-197; 002-113-982-958-529; 003-103-431-474-664; 003-137-099-327-536; 003-374-204-626-722; 004-860-580-891-183; 005-553-153-856-945; 008-528-770-009-789; 011-479-043-571-011; 013-584-405-490-380; 019-330-009-722-264; 021-809-146-501-114; 023-322-924-956-376; 024-645-010-420-500; 024-909-552-405-854; 027-105-627-680-953; 027-534-274-534-103; 027-969-183-626-435; 028-005-187-875-797; 028-702-267-468-802; 029-559-062-367-562; 029-982-640-664-031; 033-520-463-196-553; 036-672-014-157-673; 036-905-294-612-240; 038-511-758-527-994; 040-714-141-223-423; 040-856-784-955-402; 041-346-082-360-961; 045-309-145-440-807; 053-937-194-579-503; 055-556-746-685-51X; 055-938-198-128-125; 057-635-746-537-806; 065-750-806-145-489; 066-717-399-850-907; 067-034-811-367-620; 067-508-790-495-042; 068-725-440-616-470; 069-433-596-880-560; 074-673-582-588-757; 079-186-794-748-250; 079-983-118-567-392; 080-563-843-899-028; 081-986-217-996-841; 082-644-667-674-977; 083-174-499-477-060; 084-799-292-394-467; 086-550-256-160-902; 088-221-686-800-039; 089-043-896-805-679; 089-130-310-469-555; 090-608-784-020-288; 094-065-241-429-80X; 094-573-329-693-323; 095-549-988-053-457; 097-732-051-560-271; 098-980-159-104-066; 100-361-246-135-255; 106-048-143-861-251; 116-790-084-500-26X; 119-113-819-818-430; 125-130-395-320-12X; 126-538-194-067-08X; 128-781-419-907-071; 132-870-760-929-441; 142-619-330-066-589; 147-311-910-110-057; 148-223-435-969-407; 162-315-235-973-255; 177-575-518-490-638; 184-127-711-354-368; 192-090-612-568-882,18

In what follows, I will focus on the second option and thus largely ignore the exegetical question to what extent Heath provides a fair reading of Habermas. This does not mean, however, that I will not make comparative judgements. On the contrary, my overall claim will be that Heath's new critical theory is more functionalist, and. partly as a result, less critical than Habermas's. Since lack of space does not permit me to argue this in accordance with the standards of detail that Heath's own book generally observes, my procedure may be justified by the attempt to provoke a clarificatory response from Heath.",44,2,351,362,Epistemology; Critical theory; Rational choice theory; Sociology; Ecological rationality; Communicative action; Rational agent; Functionalism (philosophy of mind); Causal decision theory; Rational expectations,,,,,http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0012217300006247 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/dialogue-canadian-philosophical-review-revue-canadienne-de-philosophie/article/new-critical-theory-based-on-rational-choice/0C8E1C2F5B6FC28B79A90F265682BC71,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0012217300006247,,10.1017/s0012217300006247,1975441658,,0,011-111-548-927-823; 011-531-263-336-641; 016-463-915-711-25X; 016-592-126-692-261; 056-451-306-514-800; 060-639-709-250-570; 068-955-679-775-178; 074-622-857-431-071; 080-860-017-532-84X; 113-569-994-189-309; 113-813-475-985-700; 119-850-389-695-898; 126-083-308-174-724; 130-603-492-608-991; 147-950-881-413-278; 163-541-241-987-09X; 188-295-774-298-461,0

The framework is based on an in-depth review of 76 empirical studies published in high-quality academic journals in the areas of accounting, operations, and strategy. The framework classifies the consequences of CPM into three categories: people's behaviour, organizational capabilities, and performance consequences. This paper discusses our current knowledge on the impact of CPM, highlighting inconsistencies and gaps as well as providing direction for future research.",23,2,79,119,Empirical research; Performance indicator; Performance measurement; Conceptual framework; Balanced scorecard; Computer science; Management science,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044500512000169 https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/1826/7498/1/Contemporary_performance_measurement_systems.pdf https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/7498 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044500512000169 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-6dc701f5-cd9c-3151-82d7-09a6ed0e7c98 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9637504.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mar.2012.04.001,,10.1016/j.mar.2012.04.001,3123861895,,0,007-374-272-894-724; 010-892-777-302-016; 011-112-614-977-912; 012-788-949-940-835; 013-289-383-881-927; 013-825-526-048-112; 015-106-740-693-982; 015-340-164-709-012; 016-102-451-280-039; 018-032-978-687-734; 020-897-215-164-526; 022-988-926-932-858; 023-059-575-461-336; 024-921-052-560-606; 025-222-651-676-153; 026-007-820-914-111; 026-377-529-633-232; 026-447-745-411-395; 026-511-592-371-989; 027-531-343-779-89X; 027-847-281-426-669; 028-358-749-840-291; 031-672-019-523-79X; 031-930-683-845-921; 032-516-752-094-221; 034-946-441-599-436; 035-086-920-750-104; 035-113-628-602-658; 035-327-439-230-633; 035-348-029-823-965; 035-843-224-416-669; 036-044-261-609-684; 036-185-720-084-493; 036-765-270-227-960; 037-402-910-470-816; 037-540-330-414-557; 039-718-959-680-287; 039-817-283-589-558; 041-799-743-183-352; 042-263-748-785-572; 043-237-760-250-279; 043-401-594-995-014; 043-593-152-879-795; 043-879-846-070-716; 044-642-100-569-714; 045-564-140-651-742; 046-434-310-284-73X; 047-041-130-014-002; 047-504-378-155-720; 047-512-650-562-393; 047-631-509-012-976; 051-069-876-508-622; 051-400-421-598-008; 053-362-623-409-285; 053-378-980-436-712; 055-122-756-950-083; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-754-701-104-236; 058-307-964-290-42X; 059-699-647-518-007; 059-946-947-278-143; 063-101-626-489-265; 063-632-778-626-33X; 063-758-537-978-83X; 063-884-128-799-395; 064-882-263-409-561; 065-711-418-552-371; 067-786-300-318-167; 070-193-889-878-304; 070-632-999-105-750; 071-738-220-832-914; 072-137-822-524-372; 072-779-164-090-553; 073-632-144-957-842; 074-446-735-521-343; 075-134-367-281-65X; 077-246-747-012-805; 077-752-240-158-41X; 079-407-290-883-797; 079-496-270-039-377; 081-529-840-037-972; 081-606-120-674-320; 083-775-328-324-362; 084-002-164-524-502; 085-074-300-529-770; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-127-364-580-849; 088-110-042-660-569; 089-046-443-883-31X; 089-091-324-875-969; 089-621-912-811-772; 091-053-354-822-248; 091-636-182-627-693; 091-807-190-695-526; 094-486-975-626-947; 095-170-318-757-184; 095-957-334-060-116; 096-200-851-830-520; 100-193-611-222-956; 101-872-083-790-888; 102-168-318-168-047; 103-618-801-089-674; 103-806-276-045-101; 104-818-410-245-652; 107-401-050-235-033; 107-622-336-385-335; 108-945-451-205-929; 109-982-040-671-094; 112-631-921-152-589; 113-185-442-425-905; 113-597-500-929-994; 117-115-940-340-13X; 117-507-454-447-292; 119-327-449-954-614; 125-608-448-628-17X; 126-969-394-173-498; 129-902-510-401-439; 133-615-216-407-672; 136-542-005-301-995; 136-822-307-552-104; 137-044-796-664-032; 138-137-688-402-464; 142-682-060-816-168; 144-092-352-074-090; 144-308-133-226-525; 146-167-634-889-710; 146-270-281-787-465; 148-197-205-275-286; 149-488-192-578-419; 149-736-663-059-026; 150-241-486-237-67X; 151-355-796-707-747; 151-539-420-210-915; 151-932-962-595-574; 153-513-344-454-834; 153-785-137-332-841; 158-410-514-616-817; 161-827-456-637-952; 170-491-136-739-781; 175-817-209-182-064; 176-241-134-682-896; 179-608-372-698-452; 180-581-963-499-488; 181-776-963-214-581; 184-128-128-711-000; 186-924-451-684-428; 187-793-942-887-763; 198-154-648-754-191,316

A formal model evaluation of the interplay between memory, fluency, and comparative judgments",,2011,journal article,"Journal of experimental psychology. Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Benjamin E. Hilbig; Edgar Erdfelder; Rüdiger F. Pohl,"A new process model of the interplay between memory and judgment processes was recently suggested, assuming that retrieval fluency-that is, the speed with which objects are recognized-will determine inferences concerning such objects in a single-cue fashion. This aspect of the fluency heuristic, an extension of the recognition heuristic, has remained largely untested due to methodological difficulties. To overcome the latter, we propose a measurement model from the class of multinomial processing tree models that can estimate true single-cue reliance on recognition and retrieval fluency. We applied this model to aggregate and individual data from a probabilistic inference experiment and considered both goodness of fit and model complexity to evaluate different hypotheses. The results were relatively clear-cut, revealing that the fluency heuristic is an unlikely candidate for describing comparative judgments concerning recognized objects.

Harris; Angela J. Langdon; Michael Breakspear,"Vibrotactile discrimination tasks involve perceptual judgements on stimulus pairs separated by a brief interstimulus interval (ISI). Despite their apparent simplicity, decision making during these tasks is biased by prior experience in a manner that is not well understood. A striking example is when participants perform well on trials where the first stimulus is closer to the mean of the stimulus-set than the second stimulus, and perform comparatively poorly when the first stimulus is further from the stimulus mean. This “time-order effect” suggests that participants implicitly encode the mean of the stimulus-set and use this internal standard to bias decisions on any given trial. For relatively short ISIs, the magnitude of the time-order effect typically increases with the distance of the first stimulus from the global mean. Working from the premise that the time-order effect reflects the loss of precision in working memory representations, we predicted that the influence of the time-order effect, and this superimposed “distance” effect, would monotonically increase for trials with longer ISIs. However, by varying the ISI across four intervals (300, 600, 1200 and 2400 ms) we instead found a complex, nonlinear dependence of the time-order effect on both the ISI and the distance, with the time-order effect being paradoxically stronger at short ISIs. We also found that this relationship depended strongly on participants’ prior experience of the ISI (from previous task titration). The time-order effect not only depends on participants’ expectations concerning the distribution of stimuli, but also on the expected timing of the trials.",7,,255,255,Interstimulus interval; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Working memory; Perception; Audiology; Stimulus control; Social psychology,bias; decision making; perceptual; prior; timing; vibrotactile,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871714/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angela_Langdon/publication/259628316_The_influence_of_prior_experience_and_expected_timing_on_vibrotactile_discrimination/links/53dc263f0cf2cfac9928ff5e.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3871714 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82856236.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255,24399927,10.3389/fnins.2013.00255,2126971738,PMC3871714,0,002-370-488-736-338; 004-990-129-191-647; 006-635-585-195-621; 006-776-808-910-215; 007-562-693-801-934; 009-273-174-068-947; 010-629-061-233-301; 012-987-257-553-318; 013-950-329-613-867; 015-850-737-875-422; 018-718-773-241-68X; 034-153-945-632-383; 041-663-521-893-233; 042-025-354-823-915; 042-773-220-708-405; 064-326-295-715-03X; 067-537-282-350-480; 090-264-277-472-582; 093-277-584-107-050; 107-022-923-209-783; 111-807-149-235-791; 123-323-955-812-48X; 127-930-296-287-932; 159-194-489-256-073,6

Uitdehaag; Antonio Criminisi,"Background: Measurement instruments used in the neurological examination, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), cannot report small changes in patient performance that may be needed to evaluate the clinical course of neurological diseases and the efficacy of treatment. For a more reliable and sensitive assessment of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) we are developing the ASSESS-MS system, which relies on the automated image analysis algorithm of defined recorded movements. To validate a more sensitive tool, a method to capture clinical judgement in a more discriminatory manner than ordinal scales is required. Therefore, we investigate the ability of experienced neurologists to evaluate motor dysfunction in MS patients via videobased paired comparisons. Objectives: To assess whether video-based paired comparisons of patient movements allow a reliable and finer-grained capture of clinical judgment of motor dysfunction in MS, than commonly used measurement instruments. Methods: Thirteen experienced neurologists were presented with pairs of video recordings of MS patients (EDSS 1-7) performing standardized movements like the finger nose test (FNT) and movements based on activities of daily living (ADL), such as drinking from a cup. The clinicians were asked to compare patients’ performance, evaluating as worse, equal or ‘judgement not possible, because of confounding factors’. The pairwise comparisons were evaluated and mapped onto a continuous scale using the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, a commonly applied model in the analysis of paired comparison data. The results were analysed for intra- an interrater reliability and were correlated with the matching EDSS subscores. Results: The paired gradings were significantly correlated with the matching subscores (e.g. Kendall’s tau for FNT was 0.5 with p Conclusions: Paired comparisons of video-captured defined movements of MS patients appear to reliably capture neurological judgment of motor dysfunction. By providing finer-grained differentiation, gradings based on paired comparisons may serve as an improved external validation in the development of more sensitive (automated) outcome measures.",,,,,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Neurological examination; Multiple sclerosis; Expanded Disability Status Scale; Computer science; Inter-rater reliability; Confounding; Activities of daily living; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/video-based-paired-comparison-ranking-a-validation-tool-for-fine-grained-measurements-of-motor-dysfunction-in-multiple-sclerosis/ https://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=231971,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/video-based-paired-comparison-ranking-a-validation-tool-for-fine-grained-measurements-of-motor-dysfunction-in-multiple-sclerosis/,,,2490612877,,0,,0

However, existing data are inconclusive with regard to comparative judgments of performance. In five experiments, participants in an easy condition gave more favorable comparative judgments than participants in a difficult condition. Participants judged their performance more favorably if they named colors of non-color words rather than non-matching color words (Experiment 1), if they had to generate six words of a category rather than 12 words (Experiment 2), if they had to run in place for 15 s rather than 2 min (Experiment 3), but the latter result holds only true if participants were not active in sports (Experiment 4).

Moreover, we discuss QoS mapping from application-level QoS to user-level QoS by principal component analysis and multiple regression analysis. In the assessment, we simulate the transmission of an audio-video stream over a loaded network. In order to investigate the effect of the contents on QoS mapping, we treat two types of audio-video streams.

Joore; T. van der Weijden; Carmen D. Dirksen,"Background There is full awareness of the urge to integrate patient perspectives in guidelines. Active patient participation in guideline development is advocated, the passive use of research results on patient preferences is rather limited. Objectives To explore ideas and opinions regarding potential barriers and facilitators for integrating research results on patient preferences in guideline development. Methods Eight interviews were held with patient representatives, guideline developers, policy-makers and researchers. Interviews were semi-structured along three themes: definition of patient preferences; consideration of research on patient preferences in guideline development and aspects of obtaining patient preferences through research. Results Most interviewees defined preferences broadly, using terms as ideas, values, wishes, needs, expectations and experiences. Others described preferences exclusively as comparative judgments. Interviewees had difficulties reflecting on considering patient preferences by using research results, instead of active participation. Although the general increasing focus on patient participation facilitates the use of research results, many barriers were mentioned: relevance of collective preference for individual decision-making; focus of evidence-based medicine on “hard evidence”; lack of reliable and valid data; unclear how to integrate research results into the development procedure.. Patient- and professional organisations often generate own evidence, with unclear scientific character. Discussion The results show which issues are important and need further clearance. Interviewees define patient preferences differently, do not believe in using such research results or do not know how to do it. Implications for Guideline Developers/Users Several issues need to be addressed to facilitate the integration of research results on patient preferences in guideline development.",22,Suppl 1,52,52,Patient participation; Guideline; Know-how; Patient representatives; Guideline development; In patient; Active participation; Patient preference; Medical education; Knowledge management; Medicine,,,,,https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/22/Suppl_1/52.1 https://qualitysafety.bmj.com/content/qhc/22/Suppl_1/52.1.full.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002293.154,,10.1136/bmjqs-2013-002293.154,2070142680,,0,,0

Baldo,"Comparative judgment is a crucial task in ecological settings, as well as in many experimental studies about basic aspects of perceptual processes. It has long been known that sequential comparison is prone to order effects. This phenomenon has received little attention and has often been discounted as a type of response bias. In the present study, we investigated brightness discrimination of two brief (100 ms) spatially disjoint luminance stimuli. In the first and second experiments, stimuli were presented against a dark background with a stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) from 0 to 200 ms, in a paradigm controlling for response bias. In the third experiment, stimuli were presented against a bright background. We demonstrate that the time interval between stimuli modulates and even inverts their perceived brightness difference, enhancing the second stimulus relative to the first. When the background is brighter than the target stimuli, the sign of the effect is inverted, suggesting that the underlying mechanism operates on contrast rather than brightness. The magnitude of this effect is shown to depend on SOA and average luminance level of the target stimuli.

However, little is known about the rapid adaptation to stimulus duration. In this study, we investigated whether the duration aftereffect could also be induced by short-term adaptation to stimuli of both sub- and supra-second durations. To control for the internal reference for duration judgment, participants were adapted to a stimulus of medium duration, and then tested with both longer and shorter stimuli. We found that the duration aftereffect was only observed after long-term adaptation to stimuli of both sub- and supra-second durations, which suggests that the exposure time to the adaptor is a fundamental factor in determining the duration aftereffect. Our findings offer further evidence of the duration aftereffect, which in this study was dissociated from the anchor effect and high-level aftereffects.",8,,491,,Developmental psychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Audiology,duration adaptation; duration aftereffect; duration of adaptation; duration perception; internal reference,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28424646 https://core.ac.uk/display/82860849 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00491/pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/LIDAD https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00491/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82860849.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00491,28424646,10.3389/fpsyg.2017.00491,2605251794,PMC5380747,0,000-189-716-949-775; 005-759-420-394-604; 005-764-564-405-145; 008-331-913-073-376; 008-957-623-803-697; 009-008-312-836-733; 011-783-771-606-311; 012-359-506-167-948; 013-749-983-651-273; 013-756-511-949-392; 016-958-855-662-98X; 018-092-790-878-47X; 018-883-263-979-616; 019-087-484-867-473; 020-165-660-372-880; 021-104-327-601-907; 022-518-399-721-613; 022-586-945-516-364; 023-751-636-774-418; 024-215-642-942-26X; 024-403-671-372-719; 026-322-519-796-814; 026-956-540-667-923; 031-698-015-641-102; 031-757-850-149-098; 032-463-273-683-604; 032-812-557-034-06X; 035-251-252-983-83X; 037-326-716-652-681; 039-272-226-673-019; 039-712-981-512-194; 041-344-597-573-457; 043-202-114-476-003; 044-777-879-974-331; 052-171-059-766-178; 056-619-448-208-67X; 056-636-854-611-370; 060-132-176-671-715; 060-592-183-244-487; 061-627-654-079-398; 065-493-707-282-846; 074-399-446-111-533; 090-081-442-058-800; 092-493-857-151-832; 094-388-504-655-910; 097-264-615-112-104; 097-649-832-039-369; 104-287-741-062-156; 105-441-783-720-697; 107-891-755-852-124; 109-926-695-208-803; 115-524-258-470-155; 115-879-149-784-406; 125-692-390-431-60X; 126-422-813-112-165; 126-575-849-836-322; 127-930-296-287-932; 140-575-894-318-791; 142-134-219-637-333,6

Lucas; Philipp Rohlfshagen,"Game competitions may involve different player roles and be score-based rather than win/loss based. This raises the issue of how best to draw opponents for matches in ongoing competitions, and how best to rank the players in each role. An example is the Ms Pac-Man versus Ghosts Competition which requires competitors to develop software controllers to take charge of the game's protagonists: participants may develop software controllers for either or both Ms Pac-Man and the team of four ghosts. In this paper, we compare two ranking schemes for win–loss games, Bayes Elo and Glicko. We convert the game into one of win–loss (“dominance”) by matching controllers of identical type against the same opponent in a series of pair-wise comparisons. This implicitly creates a “solution concept” as to what a constitutes a good player. We analyze how many games are needed under two popular ranking algorithms, Glicko and Bayes Elo, before one can infer the strength of the players, according to our proposed solution concept, without performing an exhaustive evaluation. We show that Glicko should be the method of choice for online score-based game competitions.",8,1,1,12,Combinatorial game theory; Solution concept; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Screening game; Game mechanics; Repeated game; Computer science; Non-cooperative game; Video game design; Sequential game,,,,,https://qmro.qmul.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/123456789/57807 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tciaig/tciaig8.html#SamothrakisLLR16 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/11984/ https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6873276 https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2014.2346242 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74370985.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tciaig.2014.2346242,,10.1109/tciaig.2014.2346242,1992065666,,0,001-838-429-450-73X; 004-384-289-533-503; 014-837-589-055-496; 018-859-803-714-556; 024-720-037-294-978; 038-623-689-326-641; 049-475-401-016-503; 061-028-651-699-570; 062-277-876-778-847; 064-176-452-338-805; 064-284-545-093-008; 065-655-968-317-33X; 067-417-335-935-292; 070-908-054-718-384; 076-571-846-667-72X; 081-370-959-105-221; 081-689-073-237-537; 085-311-194-590-821; 087-991-691-200-809; 100-092-259-619-002; 107-676-482-899-709; 112-714-330-059-351; 132-825-065-959-38X; 134-209-258-360-246; 152-343-149-563-220,10

Here, we report on a negative time-order effect (TOE) in this type of judgment: When nonsymbolic numerical stimuli are presented sequentially, the second stimulus is overestimated compared to the first. We examined this ""recent is more"" effect in two comparative judgment tasks: larger-smaller discrimination and same-different discrimination. Ideal-observer modeling revealed evidence for a TOE in 88.2% of the individual data sets. Despite large individual differences in effect size, there was strong consistency in effect direction: 87.3% of the identified TOEs were negative. The average effect size was largely independent of task but did strongly depend on both stimulus magnitude and interstimulus interval. Finally, we used an estimation task to obtain insight into the origin of the effect. We found that subjects tend to overestimate both stimuli but the second one more strongly than the first one. Overall, our findings are highly consistent with findings from studies on TOEs in nonnumerical judgments, which suggests a common underlying mechanism.

General,19392222; 00221015; 00963445,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Oliver Schweickart; Norman R. Brown,"How do people compare quantitative attributes of real-world objects? (e.g., Which country has the higher per capita GDP, Mauritania or Nepal?). The research literature on this question is divided: Although researchers in the 1970s and 1980s assumed that a 2-stage magnitude comparison process underlies these types of judgments (Banks, 1977), more recent approaches emphasize the role of probabilistic cues and simple heuristics (Gigerenzer, Todd, & The ABC Research Group, 1999). In this article, we review the magnitude comparison literature and propose a framework for magnitude comparison under uncertainty (MaC). Predictions from this framework were tested in a choice context involving one recognized and one unrecognized object, and were contrasted with those based on the recognition heuristic (Goldstein & Gigerenzer, 2002). This was done in 2 paired-comparison studies. In both, participants were timed as they decided which of 2 countries had the higher per capita gross domestic product (GDP). Consistent with the MaC account, we found that response times (RTs) displayed a classic symbolic distance effect: RTs were inversely related to the difference between the subjective per capita GDPs of the compared countries. Furthermore, choice of the recognized country became more frequent as subjective difference increased. These results indicate that the magnitude comparison process extends to choice contexts that have previously been associated only with cue-based strategies. We end by discussing how several findings reported in the recent heuristics literature relate to the MaC framework.",143,1,273,294,Statistics; Gross domestic product; Per capita; Heuristics; Econometrics; Psychology; Recognition heuristic; Distance effect; Lack of knowledge; Probabilistic logic; Magnitude (mathematics),,"Choice Behavior; Humans; Judgment; Knowledge; Reaction Time; Recognition, Psychology; Uncertainty",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0031451 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23317086 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23317086 http://core.ac.uk/display/23796235 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Brown2/publication/234132135_Magnitude_Comparison_Extended_How_Lack_of_Knowledge_Informs_Comparative_Judgments_Under_Uncertainty/links/02bfe51099117b8a64000000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0031451,23317086,10.1037/a0031451,2052329640,,0,000-296-044-768-210; 001-635-194-973-113; 002-696-178-113-354; 004-082-556-817-313; 006-064-785-394-75X; 006-240-462-825-885; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-060-749-004-206; 007-492-644-918-414; 008-484-658-695-107; 009-188-129-583-580; 010-432-476-671-646; 011-794-460-334-72X; 012-233-074-992-683; 012-310-025-696-630; 012-584-691-775-195; 012-712-480-459-313; 014-304-423-897-683; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-438-253-383-845; 016-613-594-721-06X; 018-169-036-496-712; 018-426-369-071-24X; 018-975-331-902-441; 019-567-702-794-034; 020-681-709-047-263; 022-833-223-856-223; 023-909-015-053-340; 025-206-322-285-127; 029-091-639-120-134; 030-356-908-454-981; 031-674-560-923-897; 031-680-458-053-590; 033-434-459-390-168; 035-061-927-263-746; 036-490-234-502-291; 037-743-862-202-918; 038-210-083-546-097; 039-183-865-928-263; 039-842-392-348-547; 040-037-773-080-760; 040-464-529-994-09X; 042-108-554-770-743; 042-288-351-307-856; 044-161-468-943-922; 044-729-100-505-384; 045-445-063-674-649; 047-116-933-879-118; 048-451-961-710-445; 048-889-201-158-674; 049-230-710-101-888; 050-050-769-884-407; 050-238-137-815-416; 051-262-764-422-271; 051-329-397-927-297; 054-577-250-506-991; 056-077-364-843-664; 057-349-983-849-38X; 058-571-827-675-115; 060-493-015-131-893; 061-934-855-450-018; 064-791-567-370-092; 065-762-052-067-91X; 066-410-055-478-754; 069-967-924-571-836; 071-028-242-003-715; 074-245-792-789-206; 075-390-915-011-670; 075-455-983-689-584; 076-538-809-196-696; 076-784-374-453-123; 078-531-917-031-005; 079-491-452-707-767; 082-869-904-742-660; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-866-171-771-342; 087-351-485-660-85X; 094-898-738-351-936; 098-804-277-492-271; 100-583-400-967-409; 105-445-045-192-413; 107-865-573-870-138; 109-926-662-069-886; 110-878-263-543-335; 113-067-244-251-003; 113-095-154-061-52X; 115-669-358-173-614; 117-754-333-941-321; 122-283-850-219-831; 124-533-351-959-896; 125-382-726-486-898; 137-590-660-706-289; 142-997-916-133-687; 144-773-793-667-047; 146-455-178-307-380; 147-144-905-632-234; 149-312-824-630-416; 161-103-874-353-086; 166-688-877-483-052; 171-430-553-845-718; 176-017-510-665-867; 178-535-113-631-236; 198-820-496-984-546,9

Results indicated that, contrary to what would be predicted by statistical averaging, the precision of mean size perception decreases with the number of judged elements. Since mean size discrimination was insensitive to how total size differences were distributed among individual elements, this suggests that the observer has a limited cognitive access to the size of individual elements pooled together in a compulsory manner before size information reaches awareness. Confirming the associative law of addition means, observers are indeed sensitive to the mean, not the sizes of individual elements. All existing data can be explained by an almost general theory, namely, the Noise and Selection (N&S) Theory, formulated in exact quantitative terms, implementing two familiar psychophysical principles: the size of an element cannot be measured with absolute accuracy and only a limited number of elements can be taken into account in the computation of the average size. It was concluded that the computation of ensemble characteristics is not necessarily a tool for surpassing the capacity limitations of perceptual processing.",83,,25,39,Statistics; Sensory threshold; Associative property; Cognition; Perception; Size Perception; General theory; Mathematics; Computation; Observer (quantum physics),,"Discrimination, Psychological/physiology; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Models, Theoretical; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Size Perception/physiology",,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81112203 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552#! http://psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik-Toom-etal-General-Theory_VR2013.pdf http://sys130.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik-Toom-etal-General-Theory_VR2013.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23499976 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81112203.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2013.02.018,23499976,10.1016/j.visres.2013.02.018,2039528732,,0,000-377-083-577-34X; 000-767-743-811-415; 001-529-878-461-937; 003-103-431-474-664; 003-117-529-078-237; 004-297-191-539-32X; 004-449-360-245-032; 005-589-187-502-728; 006-518-470-945-856; 006-791-051-768-178; 008-243-135-843-679; 008-531-871-132-038; 011-473-019-333-825; 013-064-393-085-978; 016-742-417-043-764; 018-051-287-827-615; 020-807-167-419-368; 024-306-285-412-917; 024-595-422-424-118; 024-673-786-111-666; 024-919-538-411-376; 025-351-543-577-386; 025-403-737-617-229; 028-183-827-153-760; 031-495-429-097-178; 031-547-776-718-970; 031-685-126-827-222; 032-278-554-207-722; 032-323-072-565-762; 032-471-285-806-958; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-198-059-523-21X; 040-935-145-873-641; 040-995-551-856-059; 041-142-702-847-240; 043-206-619-608-508; 044-576-839-282-073; 046-094-244-181-645; 050-390-666-490-991; 051-350-468-536-063; 051-472-129-782-759; 055-807-088-113-125; 057-472-267-307-954; 059-975-734-862-12X; 059-984-158-464-717; 062-715-707-819-617; 063-350-353-646-858; 065-308-219-393-478; 067-130-107-656-138; 067-566-373-687-778; 067-631-252-449-755; 069-372-379-869-609; 076-483-968-109-005; 078-474-590-257-88X; 078-479-099-650-852; 081-155-610-461-715; 083-405-990-852-057; 084-295-432-154-870; 086-289-201-316-010; 086-949-607-297-834; 086-993-701-614-697; 088-559-042-456-736; 097-548-842-291-32X; 097-641-560-543-097; 098-950-277-295-601; 109-402-746-487-551; 121-161-560-636-803; 129-827-356-327-594; 143-356-867-650-624; 166-150-163-298-176; 173-486-040-154-60X; 182-300-831-265-929; 182-999-071-211-101; 187-775-804-492-449; 195-044-985-743-85X,46

A new fuzzy prioritization method, which derives crisp priorities from consistent and inconsistent fuzzy comparison matrices, is proposed.

By converting such data to multiple binomial responses, dependencies between the decisions of the judges as well as possible association structures between the attributes can be incorporated in the model, providing an advantage over parallel univariate analyses of individual attributes. The approach outlined gives parameters which can be interpreted as (conditional) log–odds and log–odds ratios. As the model is a generalised linear model, parameter estimation can use standard software and the GLM framework can be used to test hypotheses on these parameters.",52,2,197,209,Statistics; GLIM; Multivariate statistics; Linear model; Estimation theory; General linear model; Software; Mathematics; Generalized linear model; Log-linear model,,,,,http://eprints.ncrm.ac.uk/759/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/mss/mss52.html#DittrichFHK06 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165489606000400 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/50213/ http://core.ac.uk/display/1556713 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2006.06.001 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/matsoc/v52y2006i2p197-209.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0165489606000400 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1556713.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2006.06.001,,10.1016/j.mathsocsci.2006.06.001,2051446111,,0,002-201-404-252-380; 005-932-334-805-223; 010-493-224-417-413; 011-105-391-999-886; 012-970-071-367-137; 014-703-279-291-553; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-318-447-805-808; 031-779-699-577-483; 037-914-284-299-108; 041-706-379-743-767; 047-005-506-445-938; 059-826-912-080-827; 062-275-651-653-083; 068-962-563-112-01X; 087-351-485-660-85X; 087-476-383-908-729; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-318-148-420-714; 095-343-050-791-375; 113-278-954-446-219; 122-376-674-983-517; 124-850-148-955-311; 150-075-524-345-524; 157-189-775-028-646,11

This paper proposes a supervised learning method, by introducing a new generalized Bradley-Terry model, named Only-One-Victor, to learn patterns from game records. Basically, our algorithm applies the same idea with Elo rating algorithm, which considers each move in game records as a group of move patterns, and the selected move as the winner of a kind of competition among all groups on current board. However, being different from the generalized Bradley-Terry model for group competition used in Elo rating algorithm, Only-One-Victor model in our work simulates the process of making selection from a set of possible candidates by considering such process as a group of independent pairwise comparisons. We use a graph theory model to prove the correctness of Only-One-Victor model. In addition, we also apply the Minorization-Maximization (MM) to solve the optimization task. Therefore, our algorithm still enjoys many computational advantages of Elo rating algorithm, such as the scalability with high dimensional feature space. With the training set containing 115,832 moves and the same feature setting, the results of our experiments show that Only-One-Victor outperforms Elo rating, a well-known best supervised pattern learning method.",9,1,88,102,Stability (learning theory); Online machine learning; Supervised learning; Artificial intelligence; Wake-sleep algorithm; Instance-based learning; Computer Go; Computer science; Semi-supervised learning; Unsupervised learning,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347363 https://xplqa30.ieee.org/document/7347363/ http://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2504108 https://ir.nctu.edu.tw:443/handle/11536/144531 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tciaig/tciaig9.html#WangXZHTW17 https://doi.org/10.1109/TCIAIG.2015.2504108 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7347363/ https://www.computer.org/csdl/trans/ci/2017/01/07347363.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tciaig.2015.2504108,,10.1109/tciaig.2015.2504108,2343649163,,0,002-944-338-715-953; 006-987-976-833-124; 007-559-505-007-948; 007-673-043-916-766; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-803-917-677-996; 035-321-509-678-402; 037-472-901-700-003; 049-120-385-231-496; 049-518-232-148-640; 059-263-707-329-033; 062-098-042-925-202; 062-107-888-876-08X; 081-370-959-105-221; 085-311-194-590-821; 112-714-330-059-351; 114-756-469-956-16X; 122-047-284-242-740; 124-626-119-412-629; 127-459-729-409-121; 150-278-005-653-672; 152-913-133-407-487; 160-230-990-325-707; 165-167-460-079-791; 177-673-112-405-471,1

045-322-807-082-276,Color Imaging Conference - Image Quality Measures for Evaluating Gamut Mapping.,,2009,conference proceedings,,,,,Zofia Baranczuk; Peter Zolliker; Joachim Giesen,"In this paper we compare different image quality measures for the gamut mapping problem, and validate them using psychovisual data from four recent gamut mapping studies. The psychovisual data are choice data of the form: given an original image and two images obtained by applying different gamut mapping algorithms, an observer chooses the one that reproduces the original image better in his/her opinion. The scoring function used to validate the quality measures is the hit rate, i.e., the percentage of correct choice predictions on data from the psycho-visual tests. We also propose a new image quality measure based on the difference in color and local contrast. This measure compares well to the measures from the literature on our psycho-visual data. Some of these measures predict the observer’s preferences equally well as scaling methods like Thurstone’s method or conjoint analysis that are used to evaluate the psycho-visual tests. This is remarkable in the sense that the scaling methods are based on the experimental data, whereas the quality measures are independent of this data. Introduction Gamut mapping describes how a color image is rendered on a device with limited color reproduction capabilities. This classical problem is still an area of active research – Morovic gives a good recent overview [1]. An important step in improving gamut mapping algorithm is an accurate evaluation of its psycho-visual performance. This is traditionally achieved using psycho-visual tests, where observers have to decide which of the mapped images are the better representation of the original. The data gathered in such a test are typically evaluated using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgement [2]. An alternative approach that we want to evaluate here is to use an image quality measure (independent of observer feedback) to measure the difference of a mapped image to the original. An overview of the state of the art in image quality research can be found for example in [3] or [4]. Image quality measures are successfully used in many imaging applications, such as modeling image distortions, especially in data compression [5]. The advantage of using “good” image quality measures to evaluate gamut mapping algorithms is that they can be used to automatically predict the perceived quality of a mapped image without the need for a new psycho-visual study. Psychovisual tests generally give reliable results for tested settings but the tests are time consuming. Furthermore, an extrapolation to changed settings and new images is problematic. Computing an image quality measure on the other hand provides results immediately. The challenge is to find a measure that correlates well with observers’ preferences. It has to represent the response of the human visual system as a mathematical function. For gamut mapping the main image quality factors are preservation of lightness/color and preservation of spatial details. Artifacts introduced by the mapping algorithms may also be a factor which, however, will be neglected in the present study. Some factors encountered in other image quality applications such as noise or compression artifacts are of minor importance for gamut mapping. The main topic of this paper is a quantitative comparison of the performance of image quality measures with data driven quality measures from psycho-visual tests. The performance of the measures is assessed as the percentage of correctly predicted observer choices on data from a psycho-visual test. The data used to compute these percentages were neither used for data evaluation nor for the optimization of the corresponding measures (compare Section ”Validating the quality measures”). Correlations of psycho-visual gamut mapping evaluation and image quality measures have been published before in [6], where only a general ranking of gamut mapping algorithms has been discussed. Our focus here is on predicting observers’ choices in individual comparisons between mapped images. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In the next two sections we describe the image quality measures considered in this paper. Then Thurstone’s method and an extension to conjoint analysis are briefly described as methods for evaluating psycho-visual test data. In the subsequent section we describe how to validate the different image quality measures for gamut mapping. The data sets which we used for validation are described in a section on its own. Finally, we discuss the experimental validation results on data sets and conclude the paper. Image quality measures In this section we review the image quality measures that we have compared. We always compare two images X and Y with n×m pixels. At the pixels xi j ∈ X and yi j ∈ Y , respectively, we consider color coordinates. Mostly we are using the lightness coordinate L in CIELAB color space. If not stated otherwise we do not distinguish in our notation between a pixel and the color coordinate considered at this pixel. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) The Structural Similarity Index was introduced by Wang et. al. [7] and is defined on quadratic image patches of size k× k at the same location within image X and Y . We computed SSIM for the L coordinate in CIELAB color space. Let PX ⊂ X be such a patch and PY the corresponding patch for Y . We compute the following quantities for the patches: PX = 1 k2 ∑ x∈PX x, PY = 1 k2 ∑ y∈PY y, 17th Color Imaging Conference Final Program and Proceedings 21 Figure 1: The original image (on the left) and two gamut mapped images (in the middle and on the right). For the image in middle we have QΔE = 24.65 and QΔLC = 0.341 using HPminDE without detail enhancement, and on the right we have QΔE = 27.00 and QΔLC = 0.318 using HPminDE with details enhancement. Note for the image in the middle QΔE is smaller than for the image on the right, but the middle image has lost a lot of details and has the larger perceptual distance from the original (left image). σPX 2 = 1 k2 −1 ∑ x∈PX (x− PX ) , σPY 2 = 1 k2 −1 ∑ y∈PY (y− PY ) , and σPX PY = 1 k2 −1 k2 ∑ i=1 (xi − PX )(yi − PY ) The Structural Similarity Index is then defined as SSIM(PX ,PY ) = (2PX PY +c1) (2σPX PY +c2) ( P2 X + P 2 Y +c1 )( σ2 PX +σ 2 PY +c2 ) , with two constants c1 and c2. As proposed by Wang et. al. [5] we used c1 = 1 and c2 = 9 for these constants and k = 8 for the patch size. From the Structural Similarity Index the image quality measure QSSIM(X ,Y ) can be defined as the Structural Similarity Index SSIM averaged over all possible k× k patches in the images X and Y . The resulting measure is in the range [−1,1], and the higher the QSSIM value, the more similar are the compared images. Laplacian mean square error (LMSE) Like the Structural Similarity Index the Laplacian Mean Square Error (compare [8]) is a local measure for the difference in two images. We compute the following quantities at each pixel (more exactly at L coordinate in CIELAB color space of each pixel, with indices 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1 and 2 ≤ j ≤ m−1) of X and Y , respectively: L(xi j) = x(i+1) j +x(i−1) j +xi( j+1) +xi( j−1)−4xi j and L(yi j) = y(i+1) j +y(i−1) j +yi( j+1) +yi( j−1)−4yi j The image quality measure QLMSE is then defined as QLMSE(X ,Y ) = 1 (n−2)(m−2) n−1 ∑ i=2 m−1 ∑ j=2 ( L(xi j)−L(yi j) )2 . Mean square error (MSE) We also consider the mean square error which is just the squared pointwise difference between the images X and Y . The corresponding image quality measure QMSE is defined as QMSE(X ,Y ) = 1 nm n ∑ i=1 m ∑ j=1 (xi j −yi j), where xi j and yi j are L coordinates in the CIELAB color space for the points in images X and Y respectively. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) The discrete wavelet transform image quality measure has been defined in [9]. Images X and Y are compared as follows: a discrete wavelet transform is applied to the luminance layer of image X and Y , respectively. Let M f X be the magnitudes of the discrete wavelet transform coefficients obtained for X and frequency band f , and let M f Y be the corresponding magnitudes for image Y . From M f X and M f Y the absolute values of differences d f i (X ,Y ) = ∣∣M f X i −M f Y i ∣∣ , i = 1, . . . , ∣∣M f X ∣∣= ∣∣M f Y ∣∣ . are computed for each frequency band. Let σf (X ,Y ) be the standard deviation of the differences d f i (X ,Y ) for frequency band f . Now, the QDWT(X ,Y ) image quality measure is defined as the mean of the σ f (X ,Y ) for all the frequency bands. In our implementation we use Daubechies’ filter [10] to compute the discrete wavelet transform image quality measure QDWT. 22 ©2009 Society for Imaging Science and Technology A new quality measure The quality measure that we are going to describe in this section is based on the observation that important factors determining the quality of gamut mapping algorithms are color preservation and contrast (detail) preservation. We estimate the degree of color preservation by using the CIELAB ΔE distance measure [11]. The example in Figure 1 demonstrates that QΔE , i.e., the quality measure derived from ΔE, alone is not an accurate quality measure since it neglects the preservation of details. To account also for detail preservation we introduce a contrast preserving measure that we call QΔLC . Our quality measure is then a linear combination of QΔE and QΔLC . Below we describe the two measures QΔE and QΔLC in more detail. The measure QΔE ΔE is defined as the Euclidean distance in CIELAB color space between corresponding pixels in two images X and Y of size n×m. That is, locally at pixel x ∈ X and the corresponding pixel y ∈Y the ΔE distance is defined as: ΔE(x,y) = √ ((Lx −Ly)2 +(ax −ay)2 +(bx −by)2) As our image quality measure QΔE we take the average ΔE over the pixels of the two images, i.e.,",,,21,26,Discrete mathematics; Square (algebra); Color image; Pixel; Gamut; Color space; Mathematics; Image quality; Function (mathematics); Linear combination,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imaging/cic2009.html#BaranczukZG09 http://www.imaging.org/site/PDFS/Reporter/Articles/REP25_1_CIC17_BARANCZUK_PG21.pdf,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imaging/cic2009.html#BaranczukZG09,,,2403618208,,0,011-929-709-273-105; 012-267-637-411-009; 012-607-424-849-021; 016-349-641-603-550; 024-552-039-065-36X; 033-624-410-466-325; 034-067-552-921-802; 042-989-858-001-380; 046-531-946-022-828; 049-373-296-471-637; 057-907-564-621-130; 079-995-145-469-497; 108-002-099-886-601; 116-237-865-563-980; 119-338-111-500-600; 136-131-588-534-187; 137-000-353-619-967; 163-590-981-274-352; 166-585-827-428-918,13

This dissertation explores the influence of self-enhancement, or the tendency to evaluate oneself in an unrealistically positive way, on self-reported judgments of happiness and life satisfaction. Further, it examines how accounting for self-enhancement can influence--and in some ways, even reverse--our understanding of happiness differences between political conservatives and liberals. Three studies in Chapter 2 demonstrate a distorting effect of self-enhancement on self-reports of SWB. It is shown that both dispositional levels of self-enhancement and experimentally manipulated self-enhancement motivation lead to a tendency to report SWB at unrealistically favorable levels in social comparative judgment tasks, as well as on established scales of SWB. Chapter 3 of the dissertation examines group-level differences in self-enhancement between political conservatives and political liberals. Meta-analyses of eight measures of self-enhancement reveal significant positive relationships with general, economic, social, and moral dimensions of political conservatism. Chapter 4 examines whether liberal-conservative differences in self-enhancement explain why conservatives typically report greater SWB than liberals. Chapter 4 finds that conservatives' stronger tendency to engage in self-enhancement fully mediates the ideology--SWB relationship. Three additional studies assess happiness-related behaviors among liberals and conservatives using large archives of text from the U.S. Congressional Record and Twitter, along with photographs from the U.S. Congressional Pictorial Directory and LinkedIn. Chapter 4 shows that liberals use more frequent positive emotional language and less frequent negative emotional language, and also that liberals smile more intensely and genuinely than conservatives. These findings support the hypothesis that conservatives' reports of SWB are attributable to a self-enhancing style of self-report. In the Epilogue, practical implications of the research are discussed, specifically regarding the use of self-report methods to assess and compare group-level differences in SWB for use in public policy decision making. Theoretical implications of the research are also discussed. In particular, the nature of the long-debated relationship between self-enhancement and well-being is discussed, as are recommendations for measuring SWB, along with potential implications for re-conceptualizing multiple (i.e., defensive) manifestations of happiness.",,,,,Public policy; Subjective well-being; Psychology; Ideology; Self-enhancement; Happiness; Congressional Record; Life satisfaction; Social psychology; Politics,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cf4k128.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cf4k128,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3cf4k128,,,2521844328,,0,,0

The advent of non-rectangular displays questions this knowledge. In this paper we study how traditional content layouts can be adapted to fit different non-rectangular displays. We performed a first qualitative study where graphic designers fitted text and images into different non-rectangular displays. From the analysis of their output we generalize and adapt ten composition principles that have been proposed in the literature for rectangular displays. We evaluate the revised principles through a paired comparison questionnaire where 57 participants compared pairs of layouts. Using the Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze our data we show that some results contradict current conventions on visual design for rectangular displays. We then extracted the most interesting cases and conducted a follow up study with additional shapes to investigate how the principles generalize. From these results we propose a set of guidelines for designing visual content for non-rectangular displays.",,,4405,4416,Human–computer interaction; Follow up studies; Paired comparison; Graphical user interface; Computer science; Communication design; User interface,,,,Canada Research Chairs; Leverhulme Trust Early Career Fellowship,https://core.ac.uk/display/153389787 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/113115942/Anne_Roudaut_Visual_Composition_of_Graphical_Elements_on_Non_Rectangular_displays.pdf http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/113115942/Anne_Roudaut_Visual_Composition_of_Graphical_Elements_on_Non_Rectangular_displays.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/visual-composition-of-graphical-elements-on-nonrectangular-displays(ce51db87-670a-490c-8911-7786f8f02a6b).html https://oatao.univ-toulouse.fr/18912/ https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/chi2017.html#SerranoRI17 https://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3025453.3025677 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01740023/document https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01740023 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83929852.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025677,,10.1145/3025453.3025677,2610625806,,0,015-595-118-002-272; 015-996-559-560-947; 018-269-445-638-29X; 025-177-181-231-423; 025-538-033-165-074; 025-750-142-229-733; 028-379-130-264-22X; 029-712-119-607-36X; 030-448-817-183-408; 035-188-725-556-514; 037-246-426-529-028; 037-407-919-588-311; 039-201-203-658-010; 050-943-988-713-681; 054-058-421-092-240; 054-225-868-057-607; 060-987-144-811-625; 065-715-964-630-742; 079-137-023-874-127; 079-761-449-992-728; 081-432-087-994-13X; 081-883-540-666-971; 082-164-229-611-316; 082-612-010-145-214; 085-355-904-959-780; 086-515-227-501-962; 087-196-624-491-228; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-822-413-795-639; 095-201-238-740-998; 095-254-802-763-234; 100-012-961-274-582; 108-020-860-418-015; 113-715-311-606-525; 152-794-829-388-772; 176-859-362-885-083; 178-271-257-307-455; 184-724-777-546-536,13

The task becomes more complicated when the testing of tone-mapped images is desired as it is not possible to directly display HDR content on standard displays, hence unavailability of reference images for comparison. This limits the quality evaluation methods to comparative or categorical judgement. For this study, we used the comparative judgement method to subjectively test the performance of images tone-mapped by different operators against each other on eight different visual image appearance attributes. Attributes having a higher correlation with overall image preference scores are used to develop the proposed no-reference image quality metric.

The influence of group status and the stability of intergroup relations on leader prototypicality and endorsement,,2016,journal article,The Leadership Quarterly,10489843,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Ilka H. Gleibs; S. Alexander Haslam,"Based on the idea that leadership is a group process, we propose that followers' endorsement of a leader depends on particular leadership strategies being perceived to be best suited for maintaining or advancing group identity in the context of prevailing intergroup relations. Three experimental studies with different samples aimed to examine how socio-structural variables that define intergroup relations impact on leader–follower relations and on the support that followers give to leaders who adopt different approaches to manage intergroup relations. We demonstrate that after manipulating the status and the stability of intergroup relations followers endorse leaders who strategically engage in group-oriented behaviour that maps onto optimal identity-management strategies. These patterns mirrored differences across contexts in the perceived prototypicality. We conclude that intergroup relations influence leaders' strategic behaviour and followers' reaction to them. Findings highlight the importance of understanding leadership as both a within- and between-group process.",27,4,557,573,Collective identity; Psychology; Group process; Transformational leadership; Social psychology,,,,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/65120/ https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:377381 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984315001496 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1048984315001496 https://core.ac.uk/display/43385783 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/35438129.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.leaqua.2015.12.001,,10.1016/j.leaqua.2015.12.001,2238553582,,0,001-971-367-689-480; 003-365-460-554-065; 003-807-521-054-191; 004-154-493-487-934; 004-720-472-300-476; 005-831-997-826-620; 007-376-819-243-634; 010-018-785-751-005; 014-541-231-480-276; 016-595-637-795-346; 019-387-803-539-27X; 022-376-702-000-405; 024-543-425-779-585; 025-228-675-678-601; 026-691-432-089-133; 027-132-919-520-015; 027-521-129-086-743; 027-699-715-286-017; 028-074-475-577-638; 028-949-075-200-590; 030-425-337-421-604; 031-676-940-744-38X; 034-829-643-212-954; 036-093-214-905-414; 040-672-636-653-369; 041-875-716-172-174; 043-894-693-695-736; 044-690-606-042-094; 045-407-151-129-31X; 045-453-641-122-150; 046-727-093-044-99X; 047-539-731-254-333; 047-541-274-036-658; 048-126-979-625-194; 049-827-260-529-239; 050-425-138-218-043; 051-847-789-597-311; 053-015-526-874-461; 054-286-195-954-184; 056-745-448-836-198; 057-024-083-740-260; 057-542-494-280-625; 057-922-395-759-563; 058-170-302-729-929; 058-490-876-519-851; 059-858-735-545-553; 060-497-285-002-790; 064-643-716-266-885; 067-213-833-031-152; 067-715-519-706-692; 071-335-071-456-399; 071-356-566-078-898; 071-874-188-350-689; 074-539-042-682-091; 074-720-233-585-848; 074-741-475-829-406; 084-484-063-441-024; 088-501-131-883-236; 088-967-412-286-037; 089-653-181-176-010; 089-777-234-569-155; 092-451-543-604-039; 094-799-288-374-95X; 095-871-384-296-111; 100-916-747-829-411; 103-584-714-944-510; 104-972-304-707-126; 106-490-778-029-639; 107-553-782-692-080; 108-516-027-410-004; 111-294-779-118-265; 111-752-495-445-462; 115-764-497-261-767; 118-700-725-177-580; 120-922-676-458-188; 124-002-684-685-296; 127-277-015-675-957; 128-508-908-670-522; 134-227-121-420-235; 137-521-993-269-129; 147-621-778-616-66X; 150-325-301-231-887; 151-065-429-214-654; 151-967-432-027-123; 154-447-096-644-13X; 157-884-696-803-741; 159-775-155-570-113; 164-345-800-152-063; 172-845-804-285-649; 174-707-502-637-159; 187-657-217-342-844,13

Preferensi wisatawan merupakan gambaran-gambaran dari nilai-nilai terbaik yang dipertimbangkan wisatawan dalam menentukan sebuah pilihan berwisata. Preferensi wisatawan dianggap sebagai pandangan ideal atas keberadaan wisata dilihat dari prespektif dan tuntutan wisatawan. Studi ini bertujuan untuk melakukan perbandingan dua tempat wisata budaya kampung adat dari sisi preferensi wisatawan dengan menggunakan analisa the law of comparative judgement. Responden terdiri dari wisatawan domestik termasuk wisatawan lokal dan wisatawan mancanegara. Berdasarkan hasil komparasi dari berbagai teori, maka faktor-faktor yang menjadi hipotesa untuk diteliti dalam studi ini adalah gambaran perjalanan wisata (jarak objek wisata, lama tinggal, biaya, resiko, dan tingkat kepercayaan terhadap biro perjalanan); keunggulan daerah tujuan wisata (jenis atraksi, kualitas layanan, lingkungan fisik, dan sikap masyarakat lokal); akomodasi wisata (keberadaan fasilitas wisata, jumlah, dan kisaran harga); serta aksesibilitas (jarak objek wisata, kondisi jalan, jenis angkutan, frekuensi, dan tarif angkutan). Terdapat tiga tahapan analisa dalam studi ini yaitu: pertama, deskriptif kualitatif; kedua, analisa the law of comparative judgement; dan ketiga, analisa lokasi wisata budaya kampung adat yang paling disukai berdasarkan preferensi wisatawan dengan menggunakan metode pembobotan.Hasil analisa menyimpulkan bahwa: metode the law of comparative judgement dapat digunakan dalam studi yang bersifat perbandingan, dengan responden utamanya yaitu wisatawan; karakter yang berbeda antara wisatawan domestik dan wisatawan mancanegara menyebabkan adanya perbedaan pada penilaian kepentingan relatif preferensi setiap wisatawan; berdasarkan preferensi wisatawan, wisatawan domestik dan wisatawan mancanegara lebih memilih Kampung Adat Bena sebagai lokasi wisata budaya kampung adat yang lebih disukai; serta terdapat dua faktor pembeda yang membedakan Kampung Adat Bena dan Kampung Adat Wogo, dimana terdiri dari daya tarik wisata (tourist heritage) yaitu ornamen rumah adat (Sa’o) dan kebudayaan tradisional (bahasa, mata pencaharian dan kerajinan tradisional), serta akomodasi wisata.

046-399-630-807-084,Assimilation and Contrast Effects in Sequential Judgments,,2005,dissertation,,,,,Thomas Haar,"Based on my experiences both as a student actively taking exams and as an assessor passively journalizing exams, I was interested in the influence of prior on subsequent evaluative judgments in a sequential judgment situation. In most (written or oral) exam situations, the performances of different students are judged in a sequence. The basic idea, I started out from, was that in this case performances of different students to be judged during an exam are compared with each other; more precisely, I expected the performance judgment of a target student to be influenced by the performance judgment of the prior student. Thus, the prior student was expected to function as a comparison standard for the target student to be judged in an exam situation. This might have an assimilative as well as a contrastive effect on the judgment of the target student. In a first line of studies it was tested whether and in what direction judgments of prior performances would influence subsequent ones. Participants were in the role of a teacher and had to grade the performance of two students during an exam based either on written or oral protocols. The performance of the first student was manipulated to be either good or bad; additionally, the focus of participants was manipulated to be either on similarities or on dissimilarities via an ostensibly unrelated priming task. The results show that prior judgments may have an assimilative as well as a contrastive influence on subsequent judgments, dependent on the comparison focus of the judge. As suggested by the Selective-Accessibility Model (SAM, Mussweiler, 2003a), a similarity focus made assimilation effects more likely whereas a dissimilarity focus made contrast effects more likely. Over all three studies, assimilative influences were stronger than contrastive influences. This is in line with the SAM that describes assimilation effects as the default influence of a standard in comparative judgments. In a second line of studies, assumptions derived from the SAM concerning the processes underlying comparison effects on judgments were directly tested. The model suggests that prior to a judgment the target to be judged is compared with a given standard. During this comparison, judges follow and test either a similarity or dissimilarity hypotheses – employing a certain (positive) test-strategy – and will, thus, selectively activate information on which the final judgment of the target will be based. Participants were again in the role of a teacher and had actively to test two (or three) students in a virtual exam, using a computer-based simulation. Participants had to ask questions and received answers from the virtual students they had to grade in the end. The same variables as in the first line of studies were manipulated. The results show that participants used a positive test-strategy to test their hypothesis regarding the target student. They asked more difficult questions when expecting a well performing student than when expecting a badly performing student. The influence of this test-strategy was more pronounced at the beginning compared to the end of an exam, suggesting that participants were able to integrate (disconfirming) feedback and to adjust their hypothesis accordingly. To conclude, the first part of my work shows that comparisons may influence evaluative performance judgments in a sequential judgment situation. The second part gives first direct evidence for the assumption (derived from the SAM) that these effects are caused by an underlying process of (positive) hypothesis testing.",,,,,Psychology; Assimilation and contrast effects; First line; Comparison standard; Second line; Priming (psychology); Assimilation (phonology); Social psychology; Statistical hypothesis testing; Ask price,,,,,https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/5648/ http://www.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/archiv/5648,https://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/volltextserver/5648/,,,2467201202,,0,000-379-621-501-617; 000-663-074-092-700; 001-444-401-468-83X; 002-585-090-147-283; 003-987-150-626-381; 004-529-463-422-249; 004-570-551-864-13X; 005-266-040-284-15X; 005-686-733-637-844; 006-290-857-343-94X; 007-002-863-763-665; 007-723-443-060-728; 008-958-609-627-847; 011-118-847-386-846; 011-955-232-456-797; 012-501-336-831-651; 012-841-071-082-464; 013-463-779-463-415; 014-308-665-117-027; 015-723-155-900-331; 017-747-032-184-960; 018-216-529-415-377; 018-520-126-604-348; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-537-448-642-913; 020-946-426-493-758; 021-438-754-082-128; 022-593-672-904-040; 022-724-419-210-050; 023-163-327-843-255; 023-439-304-706-789; 023-499-771-612-794; 025-300-890-837-066; 025-856-737-306-959; 026-777-089-649-494; 026-816-205-295-697; 029-091-639-120-134; 029-642-152-661-797; 030-850-760-426-290; 031-662-295-256-772; 031-865-451-049-522; 032-130-493-257-177; 032-710-999-124-890; 033-434-459-390-168; 034-971-467-712-85X; 035-272-613-000-185; 035-851-138-335-774; 035-981-030-159-241; 036-273-367-517-410; 036-934-292-490-369; 037-110-043-957-049; 038-199-658-596-841; 038-398-775-179-926; 038-820-224-106-326; 041-762-629-780-98X; 043-141-102-769-961; 044-172-613-024-847; 044-898-441-161-708; 045-313-547-165-029; 046-030-696-320-869; 047-878-374-579-987; 049-418-416-595-391; 050-095-552-442-64X; 050-879-626-363-553; 053-496-180-165-181; 054-100-220-772-30X; 054-571-604-295-275; 054-748-247-945-380; 055-086-437-950-988; 058-826-464-346-372; 061-041-361-921-192; 062-420-560-074-770; 066-362-433-635-072; 066-833-439-013-707; 067-855-448-292-094; 070-620-378-152-396; 077-749-595-235-042; 077-969-082-862-715; 078-574-064-708-642; 079-620-280-853-749; 080-708-197-079-918; 081-382-676-113-57X; 081-867-474-239-006; 087-199-872-005-931; 087-209-273-712-841; 088-101-279-353-458; 089-298-837-389-569; 089-604-593-853-03X; 090-023-370-872-145; 090-872-089-416-38X; 092-270-180-947-346; 094-014-034-314-284; 094-593-004-106-563; 096-173-587-424-003; 096-512-362-343-935; 098-052-936-614-844; 100-996-584-039-521; 101-494-746-296-229; 102-816-927-749-122; 106-457-456-750-808; 106-820-254-065-793; 109-670-852-618-587; 110-167-195-442-258; 111-383-771-177-396; 111-712-763-114-963; 112-853-169-479-498; 113-517-679-863-899; 114-981-942-328-777; 116-886-532-943-416; 117-150-305-299-565; 118-296-135-356-165; 119-647-878-140-945; 121-853-096-503-528; 125-115-990-023-837; 130-187-302-716-052; 131-133-659-841-473; 131-877-176-809-016; 133-326-502-649-508; 133-362-129-384-449; 135-040-935-772-818; 140-219-829-733-381; 140-397-553-301-28X; 140-737-238-917-787; 144-792-882-463-568; 145-337-549-205-399; 147-672-144-580-247; 150-285-617-553-993; 159-659-983-144-568; 163-413-656-134-535; 166-927-186-805-994; 178-207-799-964-074; 179-648-930-666-874; 183-294-582-787-66X; 188-370-102-494-918; 190-086-181-064-265; 193-686-614-533-206; 199-261-472-842-277,0

The commonsense and the science appealed to are those of the society to which the anthropologist belongs or into which he has been socialized. Hence the problem is intrinsically ethnocentric. Rationality assessments are comparative judgments with no presupposition that perfect rationality is anywhere achieved or achievable. Rationality is normative: a work in progress. We strive to be ever more consistent whilst knowing we can never achieve perfection. An alternative proposal appears in a recent paper by Lukes on rationality and in Sorensen’s critique of my intellectualist view. These are criticized in their turn and it is reaffirmed that judgments of comparative rationality do little or no explanatory work. Beliefs and assertions as such are neither rational nor irrational; it is only our actions regarding them that can be so assessed. Explanation proceeds by matching means to postulated ends in defined situations, whether the ends are articulated or must be supplied by the social scientist as hypotheses to be tested. Ritual actions like chanting are pervasive. The place of ritual in science and the place of ritual in magic are quite different.",,,115,129,Epistemology; Sociology; Rationality; Presupposition; Perfection; Perfect rationality; Irrationality; Intellectualism; Normative; Irrational number,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-94028-1_9 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2F978-3-319-94028-1_9.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-94028-1_9,,10.1007/978-3-319-94028-1_9,2834685699,,0,157-482-513-225-511; 168-356-326-875-764,0

Petrusic; Craig Leth-Streensen,"In one experiment, participants compared the size of animals from memory and on congruent trials selected the smaller if both were small and the larger if both were large. On incongruent trials, they selected the larger animal if both were small and the smaller if both were large.

Jackson; Fred Schuppan; Wilbur Wanamaker,"Previous investigations of the ability of content experts and test developers to estimate item difficulty have, for the most part, produced disappointing results. These investigations were based on a noncomparative method of independently rating the difficulty of items. In this article, we argue that, by eliciting comparative judgments of difficulty, judges can more accurately estimate item difficulties. In this study, judges from different backgrounds rank ordered the difficulty of SAT® mathematics items in sets of 7 items. Results showed that judges are reasonably successful in rank ordering several items in terms of difficulty, with little variability across judges and content areas. Simulations of a possible implementation of comparative judgments for difficulty estimation show that it is possible to achieve high correlations between true and estimated difficulties with relatively few comparisons. Implications of these results for the test development process are discussed.",2014,2,1,8,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Item difficulty; Social psychology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/ets2.12042 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1002/ets2.12042,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ets2.12042,,10.1002/ets2.12042,1688896956,,0,000-225-257-224-198; 008-521-781-343-457; 021-246-150-886-188; 024-989-573-896-19X; 029-812-872-282-495; 032-888-074-486-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-314-331-841-400; 046-976-766-132-212; 069-720-532-951-990; 072-937-766-572-737; 088-861-563-323-215; 091-872-460-964-783; 096-528-140-842-778; 098-895-145-545-77X; 121-349-921-591-87X; 136-249-468-141-26X; 157-494-715-210-930; 157-661-843-707-293; 177-832-080-912-190; 185-391-073-069-464,6

Tanaka; Mariko Hiraiwa-Hasegawa; Kiyoto Kasai; Atsushi Nishida,"Abstract Introduction For assessing personal values, the rating scale method may not adequately reflect the hierarchical structure of personal values and tends to be influenced by response style bias. The paired comparison method is considered a promising alternative approach, because it engages comparative judgment and may reduce response style biases. The present study aimed to compare these two methods for assessing the hierarchy of personal values among adolescents. Methods A total of 191 community-dwelling adolescents aged 12–15 years old completed the rating scale and paired comparison version of the Brief Personalized Value Inventory. Descriptive statistics and latent class analyses were used to assess the difference between the rating scale and paired comparison methods. Results The two methods yielded similar rankings and means for personal values. The number of subgroups identified by latent class analysis was higher in the paired comparison method than in the rating scale method (10-class vs. 5-class). In the results using the rating scale method, there was a subgroup with high scores on all personal values items. Conclusions The paired comparison method captured substantially more heterogeneity in the hierarchy of personal values among adolescents compared to the rating scale, which may be influenced by response style bias.",80,,53,59,Statistics; Psychology; Paired comparison; Hierarchy; Descriptive statistics; Latent class model; Rating scale,Adolescents; Paired comparison; Personal values; Rating scale,,,"Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology; Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology",https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32062170 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S014019712030021X https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32062170/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.adolescence.2020.02.003,32062170,10.1016/j.adolescence.2020.02.003,3005997186,,0,005-944-986-860-875; 007-978-730-822-865; 008-009-727-724-934; 010-454-654-259-652; 017-419-075-144-827; 018-552-010-762-703; 018-685-674-434-912; 020-366-670-021-807; 022-481-451-123-906; 022-817-667-005-227; 024-742-437-554-430; 025-377-729-500-745; 027-557-787-443-647; 033-003-162-516-909; 035-164-522-944-043; 036-836-984-713-114; 037-787-985-539-865; 038-422-727-118-691; 042-862-670-127-16X; 043-179-447-516-584; 043-209-749-101-784; 045-099-069-141-609; 045-785-994-879-424; 050-749-118-244-077; 052-449-756-097-284; 061-739-043-813-035; 063-787-584-589-143; 065-090-505-792-171; 069-497-872-046-744; 070-499-128-016-584; 075-579-099-126-259; 088-119-096-404-035; 112-722-836-883-508; 116-410-929-900-031; 116-948-828-847-045; 139-014-710-740-870; 150-739-259-162-071; 154-990-151-532-507; 157-762-492-663-569,0

The intention was to identify the fractionation of arithmetical skills. The two girls with TS showed dissociations of arithmetical skill in the calculation system of whole numbers that support its modular organization. Fractionation of skills was observed in some components of the other number scales, suggesting an analogous organization within these scales. The operational specificity of impairment within number scales but not others argued against a unitary arithmetical system but rather for autonomous operational scales within distinct number scales.

The present study examined this suggestion in two experiments in which we manipulated the proportion of neutral/congruent trials in an experimental block. In addition, we examined the effects of control adjustment on the resolution of the task and informational conflicts.

In most settings, in addition to obtaining a ranking, finding ‘scores’ for each object (e.g., player’s rating) is of interest for understanding the intensity of the preferences. In this paper, we propose Rank Centrality, an iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects (or items) from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with an edge present between a pair of objects if they are compared; the score, which we call Rank Centrality, of an object turns out to be its stationary probability under this random walk.

R. Smith; Roy D. Patterson; D. Timothy Ives; Timothy D. Griffiths,"The size of a resonant source can be estimated by the acoustic-scale information in the sound [1-3]. Previous studies revealed that posterior superior temporal gyrus (STG) responds to acoustic scale in human speech when it is controlled for spectral-envelope change (unpublished data). Here we investigate whether the STG activity is specific to the processing of acoustic scale in human voice or whether it reflects a generic mechanism for the analysis of acoustic scale in resonant sources. In two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we measured brain activity in response to changes in acoustic scale in different categories of resonant sound (human voice, animal call, and musical instrument). We show that STG is activated bilaterally for spectral-envelope changes in general; it responds to changes in category as well as acoustic scale. Activity in left posterior STG is specific to acoustic scale in human voices and not responsive to acoustic scale in other resonant sources. In contrast, the anterior temporal lobe and intraparietal sulcus are activated by changes in acoustic scale across categories. The results imply that the human voice requires special processing of acoustic scale, whereas the anterior temporal lobe and intraparietal sulcus process auditory size information independent of source category.",17,13,1123,1128,Brain activity and meditation; Human voice; Intraparietal sulcus; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Auditory cortex; Speech recognition; Speech Acoustics; Musical instrument; Auditory perception; Biology,,"Acoustic Stimulation; Adult; Animals; Auditory Cortex/physiology; Auditory Perception/physiology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Size Perception/physiology; Sound; Speech Acoustics; Vocalization, Animal; Voice",,Medical Research Council (G0500221) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0500221(73813)) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust United Kingdom,https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(07)01485-6 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982207014856 https://hull-repository.worktribe.com/output/391290/neural-representation-of-auditory-size-in-the-human-voice-and-in-sounds-from-other-resonant-sources https://pure.mpg.de/pubman/faces/ViewItemOverviewPage.jsp?itemId=item_724844 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2335591 https://core.ac.uk/display/45985902 http://pubman.mpdl.mpg.de/pubman/item/escidoc:724844 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2335591 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82117607.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.061,17600716,10.1016/j.cub.2007.05.061,2023903027,PMC2335591,0,000-861-696-687-36X; 002-444-961-537-078; 016-227-375-936-145; 019-322-181-563-701; 022-435-613-314-389; 033-339-447-737-042; 046-962-410-192-858; 048-803-235-930-669; 053-868-736-900-992; 056-284-502-903-568; 060-706-155-415-106; 060-748-407-187-900; 062-914-971-491-202; 064-041-263-674-588; 065-548-353-798-006; 066-884-804-106-558; 071-026-823-206-765; 079-065-119-990-624; 079-868-956-326-324; 087-077-354-070-332; 093-788-430-040-716; 098-254-735-461-891; 104-898-249-163-45X; 104-962-909-902-654; 124-582-638-396-868; 128-133-689-484-835; 128-945-368-096-528; 137-415-651-147-122; 143-299-313-208-65X; 167-657-946-393-937,61

When certain pairs of items are difficult to compare, outcomes can be noisy, and it is necessary to develop robust strategies. In this work, we show how a simple active sampling scheme that uses a standard black box sorting algorithm enables the efficient recovery of the ranking, achieving low error with sparse samples. Both in theory and practice, this active strategy performs systematically better than selecting comparisons at random. As a detour, we show a link between Rank Centrality, a recently proposed algorithm for rank aggregation, and the ML estimator for the Bradley-Terry model. This enables us to develop a new, provably convergent iterative algorithm for computing the ML estimate.",,,,,Sorting algorithm; Machine learning; Ranking SVM; Artificial intelligence; Iterative method; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Ranking; Black box (phreaking); Mathematics; Centrality,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1502.html#MaystreG15 https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05556 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1502.html#MaystreG15,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.05556,,,2152408869,,0,031-830-169-787-740; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-622-562-339-932; 075-376-671-118-947; 081-370-959-105-221; 091-666-780-893-50X; 113-278-954-446-219; 141-664-268-210-645; 161-247-307-055-667; 181-375-967-075-390; 196-686-533-213-568,5

In this study Analytical Hierarch Process was applied to solve this MCDM problem. Many factors affecting a process to select an optimal repair material can be classified into quantitative and qualitative requirements and this study handled only quantitative items. Quantitative requirements in the optimal selection model for repair material were divided into two parts, namely, the required chemical performance and the required physical performance. The former is composed of alkali-resistance, chloride permeability and electrical resistivity. The latter is composed of compressive strength, tensile strength, adhesive strength, drying shrinkage, elasticity and thermal expansion. The result of the study shows that this method is the useful and rational engineering approach in the problem concerning the selection of one out of many candidate repair materials even if this study was limited to repair material only for chloride-deteriorated concrete.",6,2,87,100,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Ultimate tensile strength; Engineering; Shrinkage; Structural material; Reliability engineering; Repair material; Compressive strength; Solid mechanics; Structural engineering; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://ijcsm.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9 https://ijcsm.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9 https://doi.org/10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9 https://paperity.org/p/3982904/ahp-based-evaluation-model-for-optimal-selection-process-of-patching-materials-for http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=E1CJBL_2012_v6n2_87 https://core.ac.uk/display/81810949 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81810949.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9,,10.1007/s40069-012-0009-9,2056443393,,0,000-126-279-096-760; 002-210-702-244-754; 004-710-468-183-482; 010-561-430-726-219; 010-919-380-890-873; 017-325-686-393-649; 019-750-298-074-689; 020-908-748-338-761; 021-246-611-953-540; 021-653-819-283-636; 023-395-828-182-267; 028-117-395-282-474; 028-454-054-636-147; 029-952-444-411-670; 033-555-820-735-085; 034-435-564-899-223; 035-772-383-033-491; 035-792-941-229-201; 036-784-682-767-502; 036-936-296-483-288; 039-520-415-962-127; 039-724-098-680-971; 042-878-344-327-218; 049-024-739-601-643; 051-007-110-127-38X; 051-409-177-305-525; 053-908-471-610-204; 056-970-594-361-304; 073-698-628-241-05X; 076-827-575-639-175; 083-174-960-073-217; 084-251-259-023-396; 085-261-626-697-321; 089-875-878-057-509; 091-969-155-358-518; 093-114-388-191-658; 103-299-012-987-978; 104-470-079-266-693; 106-159-764-936-318; 112-592-574-363-330; 113-348-990-700-203; 122-704-327-849-989; 129-932-503-927-253; 142-828-598-617-987; 145-355-889-376-580; 161-398-714-772-856; 170-790-251-883-084; 173-711-799-566-43X; 186-418-882-738-30X; 189-003-310-445-936,19

Recently, an attractive objectivist response to the argument has been proposed that draws on the semantics of gradable adjectives and which does not require defending the idea that there is a single correct location for each of the unique hues (Gomez-Torrente (2016) Nous 50(1): 3–40),. In (Hansen (2015)), I argued that the recent objectivist response doesn’t apply to comparative occurrences of color adjectives, so a revised, comparative, version of the argument from interpersonal variation remains a powerful objection to certain types of objectivism. In this paper, I address several unsatisfactory objectivist replies to the comparative version of the argument from interpersonal variation, and offer what I think is a more plausible objectivist reply to the comparative argument from interpersonal variation.",8,4,809,826,Nous; Philosophy of science; Epistemology; Semantics; Psychology; Interpersonal communication; Philosophy of mind; Unique hues; Objectivism,,,,Arts and Humanities Research Council (GB),http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/67785/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs13164-016-0323-2.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29104707 https://core.ac.uk/display/81721976 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s13164-016-0323-2 https://paperity.org/p/78405412/color-comparisons-and-interpersonal-variation https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81721976.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s13164-016-0323-2,29104707,10.1007/s13164-016-0323-2,2555529945,PMC5660128,0,000-685-549-650-436; 008-650-750-922-107; 009-145-833-742-346; 016-420-369-625-169; 021-832-504-256-442; 025-425-447-585-561; 026-577-392-955-906; 031-267-377-250-331; 035-188-015-605-596; 036-888-937-037-736; 051-727-026-460-273; 058-875-518-744-570; 064-154-700-144-579; 075-695-782-211-026; 085-833-412-574-167; 090-248-309-886-342; 091-608-237-170-021; 093-497-459-464-555; 095-339-737-181-539; 099-908-040-668-745; 112-403-895-213-135; 117-351-585-846-682; 126-903-245-713-049; 128-645-238-452-067; 137-670-593-705-293; 138-111-088-696-782; 153-706-569-198-764; 157-544-001-657-047; 162-885-503-029-565; 174-745-106-201-748; 185-647-000-733-869,1

Moore; William M. P. Klein,"Abstract Which matters more—beliefs about absolute ability or ability relative to others? This study set out to compare the effects of such beliefs on satisfaction with performance, self-evaluations, and bets on future performance. In Experiment 1, undergraduate participants were told they had answered 20% correct, 80% correct, or were not given their scores on a practice test. Orthogonal to this manipulation, participants learned that their performance placed them in the 23rd percentile or 77th percentile, or they did not receive comparative feedback. Participants were then given a chance to place bets on two games—one in which they needed to get more than 50% right to double their money (absolute bet), and one in which they needed to beat more than 50% of other test-takers (comparative bet). Absolute feedback influenced comparative betting, particularly when no comparative feedback was available. Comparative feedback exerted weaker and inconsistent effects on absolute bets. Absolute feedback also had stronger (and more consistent) effects on satisfaction with performance and state self-esteem. Experiment 2 replicated these effects in a different university sample, and demonstrated that the effects emerge even when bets are placed after participants rate their satisfaction with their performance (although these ratings do not mediate the effect of feedback on bets).

Professional judgement by teachers replaces the marking of tests; a judge is asked to compare the work of two students and simply to decide which of them is the better. From many such comparisons a measurement scale is created showing the relative quality of students’ work; this can then be referenced in familiar ways to generate test results. The judges are asked only to make a valid decision about quality, yet ACJ achieves extremely high levels of reliability, often considerably higher than practicable operational marking can achieve. It therefore offers a radical alternative to the pursuit of reliability through detailed marking schemes. ACJ is clearly appropriate for performances like writing or art, and for complex portfolios or reports, but may be useful in other contexts too.

First year mathematics undergraduates (N = 194) sat a written test on conceptual understanding of multivariable calculus, then assessed their peers' responses using pairwise comparative judgement. Inter-rater reliability was investigated by randomly assigning the students to two groups and correlating the two groups' assessments. Validity was investigated by correlating the peers' assessments with (i) expert assessments, (ii) novice assessments, and (iii) marks from other module tests. We found high validity and inter-rater reliability, suggesting that the students performed well as peer assessors.

Here we bypass this problem with the Identification Task (IT) where observers identify one of N contrasts. We have found that identification data varies significantly between experimental sessions. Stable estimates using individual session data showed Contrast Response Functions (CRF) with high gain in the low contrast regime and low gain in the high contrast regime. Noise Amplitudes (NA) followed a decreasing function of contrast at low contrast levels, and were practically constant above some contrast level.

This addresses the current concern in developed economies about providing information in order to reconnect consumers with food producers and to support moves towards more local, fairly traded and sustainable production. However, we show that such a ‘knowledge fix’ approach of providing information may not reconnect consumers so easily. Participants found it particularly difficult to work out what certification involved and what kinds of organisations were providing assurance. They built vernacular typologies and comparative judgements that did not necessarily identify or prioritise ‘independent’ third-party certification as the gold standard, not least because of the practical difficulties of monitoring complex supply chains, and expressed confusion and scepticism about how well food assurance schemes could work in practice. Our results therefore problematise the knowledge fix urged in the literature and emphasise instead the need to better understand how consumers make sense of assurance information in different contexts.",24,1,1,14,Supply chain; Agricultural productivity; Economics; Marketing; Consumer economics; Consumer education; Credibility; Public relations; Certification; Program evaluation; Consumer confidence index,,,,,http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2160/2903 http://orca-mwe.cf.ac.uk/37203/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016707000472 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/37203/ https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/30767/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016707000472%20abstract https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ780445 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1917726.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.06.001,,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.06.001,2040982639,,0,000-595-849-074-515; 000-748-623-473-681; 002-063-238-335-689; 002-753-867-294-46X; 004-750-616-859-955; 004-966-115-683-261; 005-795-466-388-400; 008-580-519-050-659; 010-812-944-002-692; 012-458-125-588-240; 012-675-989-505-589; 015-071-842-834-355; 016-788-351-631-136; 019-981-283-730-805; 020-026-570-283-294; 024-036-695-451-591; 025-217-878-102-30X; 028-266-474-295-598; 031-224-190-028-650; 031-276-737-336-935; 031-753-581-887-448; 033-571-421-930-764; 035-008-859-727-939; 035-413-262-979-454; 036-203-912-180-419; 045-716-439-451-462; 049-542-552-344-27X; 058-007-242-844-895; 061-674-043-873-957; 064-014-358-244-923; 083-567-878-608-021; 091-126-272-146-99X; 092-566-902-732-519; 093-192-097-672-906; 097-289-028-577-792; 120-791-681-916-465; 124-784-333-463-949; 127-202-139-315-762; 132-768-221-475-021; 146-118-675-663-311; 148-790-948-738-664; 153-527-450-427-925; 178-687-005-951-817,95

Both SAT solvers generate resolution-style proofs for (instances of) propositional tautologies. These proofs are verified by the theorem provers. The presented approach significantly improves the provers' performance on propositional problems, and exhibits counterexamples for unprovable conjectures. It is also shown that LCF-style theorem provers can serve as viable proof checkers even for large SAT problems. An efficient representation of the propositional problem in the theorem prover turns out to be crucial; several possible solutions are discussed.",7,1,26,40,Proof complexity; Mathematical proof; Discrete mathematics; DPLL algorithm; Propositional variable; Computer-assisted proof; HOL; Proof assistant; Automated theorem proving; Calculus; Mathematics,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1570868307000614 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2007.07.003 https://philpapers.org/rec/WEBECP https://core.ac.uk/display/82749763 http://user.it.uu.se/~tjawe125/publications/weber09efficiently.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/japll/japll7.html#WeberA09 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82749763.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jal.2007.07.003,,10.1016/j.jal.2007.07.003,2168950896,,0,000-172-451-535-348; 008-277-385-210-298; 008-560-798-864-63X; 011-209-146-389-853; 011-931-973-464-122; 012-317-291-223-15X; 012-372-066-533-196; 015-684-627-388-18X; 015-958-290-935-20X; 025-157-641-644-205; 025-634-674-793-900; 031-575-799-536-705; 036-139-274-377-837; 037-581-335-680-53X; 045-721-130-018-00X; 046-117-893-757-674; 052-760-623-305-379; 057-169-679-220-394; 059-074-849-079-997; 059-543-296-336-883; 065-661-546-134-825; 067-787-900-725-502; 078-463-410-514-516; 083-227-193-323-866; 088-595-713-590-513; 097-743-063-876-840; 115-110-667-660-240; 118-814-814-948-055; 119-859-507-508-872; 120-650-141-050-358; 131-116-576-918-442; 133-759-120-926-980; 145-987-702-225-009; 149-112-784-676-543; 150-964-221-187-987; 151-220-752-532-131; 155-420-716-861-765; 155-426-160-695-761; 161-238-413-197-218; 163-753-575-651-443; 192-499-581-069-346,51

Polania; Dongning Wang; Glenn Fung,"Ordinal regression aims to classify instances into ordinal categories. In this paper, body mass index (BMI) category estimation from facial images is cast as an ordinal regression problem. In particular, noisy binary search algorithms based on pairwise comparisons are employed to exploit the ordinal relationship among BMI categories. Comparisons are performed with Siamese architectures, one of which uses the Bradley-Terry model probabilities as target. The Bradley-Terry model is an approach to describe probabilities of the possible outcomes when elements of a set are repeatedly compared with one another in pairs. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms classification and regression-based methods at estimating BMI categories.",,,,,Statistics; Ordinal regression; Binary search algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Body mass index; Computer science; Regression; Ordinal number,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03268 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03268 https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.03268 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1811.03268,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1811.03268,,,2899672884,,0,001-751-280-406-105; 007-995-213-822-730; 011-773-197-874-012; 029-037-769-928-054; 071-291-385-477-211; 072-914-744-427-852; 087-991-691-200-809; 128-594-653-384-375; 128-882-316-287-693; 129-008-158-105-49X; 162-601-746-252-49X; 165-340-931-790-691; 193-848-405-591-652; 196-441-056-369-328,1

In this paper, I deal with this problem and investigate it in relation to the kinds of sports. In the sports without body touching, in which body attack is not done in an international manner, they are almost settled by comparative judgement. On the other hand, in the sports with body touching, which focus on injury or somewhat have risk of injury, it will be possible that we show not only the case of violating rule by serious accident but also the case of international action. The important things as a standard are dynamism of sports, maintenance of attraction, and sufficient legal-protective harmony of sportsman body and health.",4,,167,183,Psychology; Law; Criminal law; Dynamism; Harmony (color); Judgement; Attraction; International Action,,,,,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE00680463?q=%5B%EC%8A%A4%ED%8F%AC%EC%B8%A0%20%EC%83%81%ED%95%B4%C2%A7coldb%C2%A72%C2%A751%C2%A73%5D&Sort=1&SortType=desc&SearchAll=%EC%8A%A4%ED%8F%AC%EC%B8%A0%20%EC%83%81%ED%95%B4&Multimedia=0&isFullText=0,http://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/ArticleDetail/NODE00680463?q=%5B%EC%8A%A4%ED%8F%AC%EC%B8%A0%20%EC%83%81%ED%95%B4%C2%A7coldb%C2%A72%C2%A751%C2%A73%5D&Sort=1&SortType=desc&SearchAll=%EC%8A%A4%ED%8F%AC%EC%B8%A0%20%EC%83%81%ED%95%B4&Multimedia=0&isFullText=0,,,1561213075,,0,,0

We also sought to identify how they prioritize between these use and non-use values. Use values are derived from productivity considerations; non-use values are derived from the wellbeing of the animals, independent of the present or future use the farmer may make of the animal. In particular, we examined the empirical content and structure of the economic value dairy farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows. Based on a best-worst scaling approach and data from 123 Swedish dairy farmers, we suggest that the economic value those farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows covers aspects of both use and non-use type, with non-use values appearing more important. Using principal component factor analysis, we were able to check unidimensionality of the economic value construct. These findings are useful for understanding why dairy farmers may be interested in considering dairy cow welfare. Such understanding is essential for improving agricultural policy and advice aimed at encouraging dairy farmers to improve animal welfare; communicating to consumers the values under which dairy products are produced; and providing a basis for more realistic assumptions when developing economic models about dairy farmers' behavior.",99,1,579,592,Welfare; Economic model; Economics; Best–worst scaling; Non-use value; Agricultural policy; Principal component factor analysis; Agricultural science; Agricultural economics; Animal welfare; Animal husbandry,animal welfare of dairy cow; best-worst scaling; economic value in animal welfare; non-use value; use value,"Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare/economics; Animals; Attitude; Cattle/physiology; Dairying/economics; Farmers/psychology; Female; Models, Economic; Motivation; Principal Component Analysis",,Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547638 https://core.ac.uk/display/82430178 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215007882 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26547638 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215007882 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82430178.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-9755,26547638,10.3168/jds.2015-9755,2195579028,,0,005-061-294-522-817; 005-844-689-987-193; 009-299-623-546-736; 014-300-074-989-740; 014-617-441-512-393; 021-937-199-568-87X; 022-297-308-392-10X; 023-121-228-228-497; 023-516-882-343-752; 023-957-645-099-200; 024-677-580-110-025; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-844-853-562-456; 048-800-722-633-000; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-790-319-210-848; 071-679-165-049-689; 072-611-672-056-002; 077-424-508-300-382; 092-594-821-493-18X; 095-153-189-825-288; 097-031-100-929-863; 098-277-196-857-548; 098-538-505-624-178; 099-167-496-298-409; 102-372-296-507-391; 115-365-719-484-555; 120-483-665-522-971; 120-902-493-548-959; 122-593-052-625-863; 127-629-056-629-021; 135-382-726-691-472; 152-039-150-446-770; 153-239-246-506-62X; 162-854-711-868-871; 164-260-106-908-120; 171-236-934-325-469; 173-935-981-761-429,23

This paper studies the assembly options by the analytic hierarchy process (AHP) model and the multi-dimension scaling (MDS) techniques. A specialized form of MDS (CoPlot software) enables presentation of the AHP outcomes in a two dimensional space and the optimal model can be visualized clearly. Four types of 8"" membranes were selected: (i) Nanofiltration low rejection and high flux (ESNA1-LF-LD, 86% rejection, 10,500gpd); (ii) Nanofiltration medium rejection and medium flux (ESNA1-LF2-LD, 91% rejection, 8,200gpd); (iii) Reverse Osmosis high rejection and high flux (CPA5-MAX, 99.7 rejection, 12,000gpd) ; and (iv) Reverse Osmosis medium rejection and extreme high flux (ESPA4-MAX, 99.2 rejection, 13,200gpd). The results indicate that: (i) Nanofiltration membrane (High flux and Low rejection) can produce water for irrigation with valuable levels of nutrient ions and a reduction in the sodium absorption ratio (SAR), minimizing soil salinity; this is an attractive option for agricultural irrigation and is the optimal solution; and (ii) implementing the MDS approach with reference to the variables is consequently useful to characterize membrane system design.",2,,,,Brackish water; Reverse osmosis; Nanofiltration; Flux; Reuse; Process engineering; Hydrology; Environmental science; Membrane; Analytic hierarchy process; Scaling,,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fenvs.2014.00056/full https://core.ac.uk/display/82869727 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82869727.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fenvs.2014.00056,,10.3389/fenvs.2014.00056,1981986970,,0,000-229-626-994-699; 001-490-031-463-501; 002-283-804-840-220; 002-291-178-261-503; 002-684-503-685-834; 003-732-049-435-367; 003-821-202-813-155; 009-427-812-879-664; 011-718-065-038-715; 013-355-592-178-704; 013-986-190-283-713; 017-031-832-369-396; 023-860-580-857-697; 024-992-738-416-578; 025-192-553-715-150; 025-636-508-239-049; 025-828-103-357-975; 027-347-292-832-151; 027-420-845-384-298; 027-658-484-897-273; 033-148-524-937-936; 034-186-277-356-547; 035-207-497-717-304; 038-402-822-341-076; 039-887-680-538-491; 040-366-625-943-496; 050-521-569-688-370; 056-531-319-757-633; 059-934-787-488-708; 064-015-585-243-191; 064-450-868-235-403; 067-341-125-020-782; 068-566-155-212-033; 068-847-325-104-811; 072-759-776-399-764; 075-233-716-616-440; 077-149-766-120-145; 077-988-686-962-34X; 081-394-767-820-585; 081-408-478-168-708; 081-798-468-327-126; 083-073-874-958-817; 091-947-931-911-471; 094-418-860-927-075; 095-997-654-846-640; 096-435-793-374-067; 097-603-069-617-976; 101-377-900-051-973; 112-472-529-948-528; 115-910-626-163-649; 121-406-776-582-94X; 122-251-072-075-977; 125-474-515-544-224; 129-477-421-409-477; 134-863-010-622-229; 135-659-121-695-795; 143-021-746-676-76X; 148-237-019-097-264; 152-418-625-342-095; 153-804-260-294-263; 156-199-017-204-375; 156-340-442-302-523; 157-236-283-939-856; 159-662-006-445-182; 161-649-770-841-661; 164-412-265-429-442; 165-837-949-613-822; 171-800-970-145-064; 177-737-411-604-980,3

Louviere,"This paper describes and applies a general approach for incorporating factors with structural equations into models for discrete choice. The approach gives form to the covariance matrix in random coefficient models. The factors act directly on the random coefficients as unobserved attributes. The structural equations allow the factors to act on each other building structures that can represent a variety of concepts such as global heterogeneity and segmentation. The practical outcomes include parsimonious and identified models with rich covariances and better fit. Of greater interest is the ability to specify models that represent and test theory on the relationships between the taste heterogeneities for covariates and in particular between the attributes within a discrete choice experiment. The paper describes the general model and then applies it to a discrete choice experiment with seven attributes. Four competing specifications are evaluated, which demonstrates the ability of the model to be identified and parsimonious. The four specifications also demonstrate how competing a priori knowledge of the structure of the attributes used in the experiment can be empirically tested and evaluated. The outcomes include new behavioral insights and knowledge about choice and choice processes for the subject area of discrete choice experiments.",5,3,145,156,Covariate; Econometrics; Choice set; Covariance matrix; Discrete choice; Mathematics; Latent variable; Multilevel model; Test theory; A priori and a posteriori,,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:312312 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/eejocm/v5y2012i3p145-156.html https://core.ac.uk/display/18442959 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513000031 https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/23937 https://socionet.ru/publication.xml?h=repec:eee:eejocm:v:5:y:2012:i:3:p:145-156 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82370163.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jocm.2013.03.002,,10.1016/j.jocm.2013.03.002,1991417763,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 004-955-765-542-299; 005-804-618-524-056; 007-484-909-003-94X; 009-249-559-388-618; 009-339-854-751-554; 011-949-894-990-410; 019-529-544-695-446; 019-891-482-379-799; 020-016-169-207-288; 024-212-855-380-113; 031-570-667-966-639; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-264-470-822-205; 042-627-416-303-850; 045-103-835-052-365; 047-989-481-889-325; 050-454-312-855-009; 050-943-988-713-681; 052-217-341-775-087; 052-510-544-504-685; 054-452-718-257-590; 057-657-809-679-383; 062-783-280-287-096; 064-120-073-762-638; 068-627-048-925-042; 069-644-036-593-571; 071-674-642-056-169; 097-197-745-382-009; 106-069-010-763-247; 107-925-302-806-160; 109-579-040-691-431; 114-685-371-109-418; 124-783-387-855-855; 125-464-631-723-976; 128-108-355-664-655; 129-221-441-521-184; 134-519-515-066-528; 145-827-958-228-980; 163-574-889-571-581; 166-533-955-715-626,24

One item may be judged more positively than another, but this result does not allow any conclusions about whether either of the items are attractive or unattractive. This article discusses the implications of this limitation for the interpretation of individual differences in comparative judgments.

A thorough treatment of the involved statistical errors is often neglected, even though this is the base for computing confidence intervals and other statistical tests. In this paper we show, that consequent error estimation through all steps of the data analysis provides a simple and reliable method to compute confidence intervals. Monte Carlo simulations are used to verify the results and to compare the proposed error estimation with other known methods.",,,39,44,Statistics; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Monte Carlo method; Perceptual image quality; Paired comparison; Method comparison; Computer science; Confidence interval; Statistical hypothesis testing,,,,,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/cgiv/2010/00002010/00000001/art00007 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cgiv/cgiv2010.html#ZollikerB10,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ist/cgiv/2010/00002010/00000001/art00007,,,2184101125,,0,011-105-391-999-886; 028-422-206-398-04X; 046-531-946-022-828; 057-907-564-621-130; 068-885-458-943-499; 087-991-691-200-809; 113-278-954-446-219; 119-277-490-603-020; 146-289-215-253-465; 166-585-827-428-918; 198-754-631-432-902,2

As FXS is well characterised at the cellular level, the condition provides a unique opportunity to investigate how a genetic dysfunction can impact on the development of neurocomputational properties relevant to attention. Thirteen young boys with FXS and 13 mental-age-matched typically developing controls performed a touch-screen-based search task that manipulated the similarity between targets and distractors and their heterogeneity in size. Search speed, path and errors were recorded as multiple measures of performance. Children did not differ in overall search speed or path when searching amongst distractors, but striking error patterns distinguished children with FXS from controls. Firstly, although clear markers of previously found targets remained on screen, children with FXS perseverated on touching previous hits more than typically developing controls, consistent with the well-documented inhibitory deficits in adults with the disorder. Secondly, they could accurately discriminate single target-distractor pairs, but, when searching a complex display, they touched distractors more often than control children when distractors were similar to targets and especially so when these were infrequent, highlighting difficulties in judging relative size and allocate attentional weight independently of stimulus frequency. Thirdly, their performance was also characterised by inaccuracies in pointing, suggesting additional motor control deficits. Taken together, the findings suggest that fragile X syndrome affects the early development of multiple processes contributing to efficient attentional selection, as would be predicted from an understanding of the neurocomputational changes associated with the disorder.",45,8,1889,1898,Attentional control; Motor control; Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Fragile X syndrome; X fragile syndrome; Stimulus frequency; Cellular level; Typically developing,,"Attention/physiology; Case-Control Studies; Child, Preschool; Computer-Aided Design; Fragile X Syndrome/physiopathology; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Reaction Time/physiology",,Wellcome Trust (066097) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0500784) United Kingdom; PHS HHS (1748/961) United States,https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/delineation-of-early-attentional-control-difficulties-in-fragile- https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2613507/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2613507 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/12423 http://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/5877/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839320600474X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002839320600474X http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/3991/ https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/12423 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ933013 https://core.ac.uk/display/82773681 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82773681.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.12.005,17254617,10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.12.005,2064723730,PMC2613507,2,000-259-472-649-370; 000-267-282-082-81X; 003-114-534-007-034; 003-738-957-493-658; 005-202-981-172-683; 008-591-623-956-796; 012-187-979-735-601; 014-067-884-199-734; 015-451-015-351-346; 017-982-956-087-298; 018-932-777-749-912; 020-468-956-209-730; 022-518-445-593-967; 023-124-008-341-408; 024-147-296-878-661; 026-559-732-755-689; 026-733-378-400-21X; 027-167-116-403-990; 029-451-729-124-936; 030-826-419-704-365; 032-176-601-807-425; 033-879-587-738-618; 035-180-114-555-292; 040-473-135-358-829; 040-883-845-354-146; 041-270-059-642-778; 047-931-265-523-60X; 050-252-933-444-629; 056-830-212-775-129; 057-297-091-481-581; 062-875-284-144-541; 064-796-703-861-420; 064-967-412-118-50X; 070-440-241-231-319; 070-642-384-082-176; 071-891-970-153-970; 078-913-011-660-220; 084-358-216-782-659; 084-649-674-864-66X; 085-349-919-554-101; 091-516-691-070-516; 094-878-091-381-801; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-761-737-295-895; 109-452-585-728-785; 123-902-138-453-161; 125-812-409-405-676; 126-623-675-542-589; 126-990-599-180-655; 134-129-530-852-822; 143-766-883-819-444; 147-776-044-858-340; 183-360-903-643-054; 193-215-263-851-593,71

No previous studies exist assessing risks and disruptions in pharmaceutical companies while assessing the pharmaceutical supply chain. Any risks affecting the pharmaceutical companies could disrupt supply medicines and health system efficiency. The goal of this study was the risk assessment in pharmaceutical industry in Iran considering process's priority, hazard and probability of risks. The study was carried out in 4 phases; risk identification through literature review, risk identification in Iranian pharmaceutical companies through interview with experts, risk analysis through a questionnaire and consultation with experts using group analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method and rating scale (RS) and risk evaluation of simple additive weighting (SAW) method. In total, 86 main risks were identified in the pharmaceutical supply chain with perspective of pharmaceutical companies classified in 11 classes. The majority of risks described in this study were related to the financial and economic category. Also financial management was found to be the most important factor for consideration. Although pharmaceutical industry and supply chain were affected by current political conditions in Iran during the study time, but half of total risks in the pharmaceutical supply chain were found to be internal risks which could be fixed by companies, internally. Likewise, political status and related risks forced companies to focus more on financial and supply management resulting in less attention to quality management.",8,1,9,9,Supply chain; Risk analysis (engineering); Risk assessment; Data mining; Business; Risk analysis (business); Supply chain risk management; Pharmaceutical industry; Financial management; Quality management; Analytic hierarchy process,Iran pharmaceutical industry; Pharmaceutical supply chain; Risk assessment; Simple additive weighting (SAW) method; analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method,,,,https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40545-015-0029-3/tables/2 https://core.ac.uk/display/81703963 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40545-015-0029-3 https://joppp.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40545-015-0029-3?site=joppp.biomedcentral.com http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4354976 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/25838919/ https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs40545-015-0029-3.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25838919 http://www.joppp.org/content/8/1/9 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81703963.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40545-015-0029-3,25838919,10.1186/s40545-015-0029-3,2095682431,PMC4354976,0,003-426-902-806-597; 006-672-649-924-583; 017-768-108-971-067; 018-255-526-454-508; 027-571-651-572-301; 031-409-983-731-881; 032-186-879-539-604; 033-989-322-464-479; 035-947-192-321-636; 036-784-682-767-502; 037-832-283-390-12X; 040-455-254-446-793; 042-668-103-718-183; 056-476-525-912-48X; 067-341-125-020-782; 071-317-917-757-357; 072-321-340-467-854; 074-247-601-951-266; 080-334-319-722-251; 083-040-780-295-310; 083-087-603-554-906; 086-973-368-258-538; 091-279-031-653-277; 091-685-467-967-764; 091-815-433-322-055; 104-895-633-900-334; 110-750-844-415-54X; 119-524-407-033-043; 120-686-333-569-167; 144-548-310-726-997; 148-341-710-322-032; 152-204-086-737-413; 156-543-624-018-777; 184-628-591-586-599; 199-806-701-765-701,36

For Children, Generics Are About Kinds Rather Than Quantities",2012-01-11,2012,journal article,Child development,14678624; 00093920,Wiley-Blackwell,United Kingdom,Amanda C. Brandone; Andrei Cimpian; Sarah-Jane Leslie; Susan A. Gelman,"Generic statements (e.g., ‘‘Lions have manes’’) make claims about kinds (e.g., lions as a category) and, for adults, are distinct from quantificational statements (e.g., ‘‘Most lions have manes’’), which make claims about how many individuals have a given property. This article examined whether young children also understand that generics do not depend purely on quantitative information. Five-year-olds (n = 36) evaluated pairs of questions expressing properties that were matched in prevalence but varied in whether adults accept them as generically true (e.g., ‘‘Do lions have manes?’’ [true] vs. ‘‘Are lions boys?’’ [false]). Results demonstrated that children evaluate generics based on more than just quantitative information. Data suggest that even young children recognize that generics make claims about kinds.",83,2,423,433,Child development; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Childhood development; Age differences; Social psychology,,"Age Factors; Association Learning; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Generalization, Psychological; Humans; Judgment; Language Development; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Semantics; Truth Disclosure; Young Adult",,NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD036043) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R56 HD036043) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (HD-36043) United States,https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/handle/2027.42/90604 https://srcd.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22235892 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/3148640 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=6217876 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ959376 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/do-lions-have-manes-for-children-generics-are-about-kinds-rather- https://deepblue.lib.umich.edu/bitstream/handle/2027.42/90604/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x.pdf;sequence=1 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/do-lions-have-manes-for-children-generics-are-about-kinds-rather- http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x/full https://www.princeton.edu/~sjleslie/LionsHaveManes.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/3148640.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x,22235892,10.1111/j.1467-8624.2011.01708.x,2121792025,PMC3571626,0,000-142-703-414-781; 003-773-463-419-304; 004-907-762-795-155; 005-990-276-487-436; 006-953-359-522-536; 010-543-400-572-408; 012-220-335-001-620; 014-098-076-552-415; 015-403-419-707-314; 015-932-857-821-217; 016-875-664-457-373; 024-387-448-081-823; 025-517-813-034-785; 025-591-974-599-707; 028-364-494-737-575; 031-643-712-687-247; 035-147-312-402-225; 035-163-556-090-408; 036-997-137-425-792; 038-654-457-701-707; 038-809-812-850-971; 039-445-990-599-259; 041-867-930-011-099; 042-423-147-359-818; 043-064-318-285-070; 043-211-810-003-159; 043-472-308-841-240; 049-596-237-094-702; 050-836-788-872-027; 055-365-578-655-191; 057-248-385-431-271; 058-893-972-234-158; 058-987-583-900-134; 059-642-821-704-386; 059-977-841-971-232; 060-830-187-835-429; 061-454-469-851-793; 062-215-338-823-854; 062-231-761-664-459; 066-254-445-888-079; 070-871-341-544-202; 070-988-980-246-446; 071-925-074-754-383; 080-467-648-762-050; 083-653-220-482-873; 086-861-795-865-790; 093-447-433-605-713; 105-543-963-437-01X; 114-085-363-355-636; 116-069-198-131-85X; 124-522-865-932-064; 132-957-177-004-275; 141-793-002-286-408; 161-029-348-135-449; 168-995-538-712-95X; 183-469-933-752-277; 195-640-398-774-062,32

We develop a novel estimator that relies on kernel smoothing to pre-process the pairwise comparisons over time and is applicable in sparse settings where the Bradley-Terry may not be fit. We obtain necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence and uniqueness of our estimator. We also derive time-varying oracle bounds for both the estimation error and the excess risk in the model-agnostic setting where the Bradley-Terry model is not necessarily the true data generating process. We thoroughly test the practical effectiveness of our model using both simulated and real world data and suggest an efficient data-driven approach for bandwidth tuning.,,,,,Nonparametric statistics; Algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Kernel smoother; Uniqueness; Bradley–Terry model; Mathematics; Oracle; Bandwidth (signal processing),,,,,https://it.arxiv.org/abs/2003.00083 https://arxiv.org/abs/2003.00083 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/2003.00083 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00083.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2003.00083 https://aps.arxiv.org/abs/2003.00083,https://it.arxiv.org/abs/2003.00083,,,3007602773,,0,000-293-900-264-098; 005-592-077-144-998; 010-916-070-573-553; 027-150-047-044-961; 029-320-744-162-009; 032-437-388-057-540; 040-081-751-236-97X; 047-307-839-107-965; 066-576-299-586-161; 071-013-174-058-797; 079-367-665-908-927; 083-083-362-692-452; 087-991-691-200-809; 098-507-541-834-429; 110-037-601-357-759; 130-026-163-479-01X; 136-510-755-969-787,0

While font size can be an intuitive dimension for the viewer, using it as an encoding can introduce factors that may bias the perception of the underlying values. Viewers might conflate the size of a word's font with a word's length, the number of letters it contains, or with the larger or smaller heights of particular characters (‘o’ versus ‘p’ versus ‘b’). We present a collection of empirical studies showing that such factors—which are irrelevant to the encoded values—can indeed influence comparative judgements of font size, though less than conventional wisdom might suggest. We highlight the largest potential biases, and describe a strategy to mitigate them.",24,8,2397,2410,Empirical research; Encoding (memory); Conflation; Data visualization; Point (typography); Perception; Tag cloud; Font; Speech recognition; Computer science,,,,Andrew W.

De Smedt; H.P. Op de Beeck,"Neuroimaging studies in the last 20 years have tried to unravel the neural correlates of number processing across formats in humans and non-human primates. Results point to the intraparietal sulcus as the core area for an abstract representation of numerical quantity. On the other hand, there exist a variety of behavioral and neuroimaging data that are difficult to reconcile with the existence of such an abstract representation. In this study, we addressed this issue by applying multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) to functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI) data to unravel the neural representations of symbolic (digits) and non-symbolic (dots) numbers and their possible overlap on three different spatial scales (entire lobules, smaller regions of interest and a searchlight analysis with 2-voxel radius). Results showed that numbers in both formats are decodable in occipital, frontal, temporal and parietal regions. However, there were no overlapping representations between dots and digits on any of the spatial scales. These data suggest that the human brain does not contain an abstract representation of numerical magnitude.",87,,311,322,Neural correlates of consciousness; Artificial intelligence; Neuroscience; Pattern recognition; Intraparietal sulcus; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Mathematics; Numerical cognition; Brain mapping; Voxel; Neuroimaging; Posterior parietal cortex,Multi-voxel pattern analysis; Numbers; Numerical cognition; Parietal cortex; fMRI,"Adult; Brain Mapping/methods; Cerebral Cortex/physiology; Cognition/physiology; Female; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted/methods; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Photic Stimulation; Support Vector Machine; Young Adult",,KU Leuven; Fund for Scientific Research—Flanders,https://core.ac.uk/display/34582089 https://lirias.kuleuven.be/109158 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913010720 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.049 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/24201011 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24201011 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811913010720 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage87.html#BultheSB14 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34582089.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.049,24201011,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2013.10.049,2040323638,,0,000-391-273-375-862; 000-495-638-642-502; 002-743-317-587-306; 003-146-829-638-518; 004-079-468-869-677; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-619-866-773-125; 008-294-750-483-791; 008-660-756-899-541; 009-779-247-911-519; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-300-064-608-597; 011-993-023-817-311; 012-736-317-039-26X; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-454-380-429-360; 015-925-668-440-954; 016-171-393-111-323; 018-785-508-118-971; 018-985-264-247-342; 019-198-395-259-670; 020-406-773-486-213; 022-049-380-598-783; 024-311-244-236-511; 025-503-036-092-835; 026-297-381-696-244; 026-617-630-691-234; 027-722-881-226-813; 030-087-358-677-263; 032-188-208-040-57X; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-559-042-610-406; 038-741-726-616-443; 039-919-929-065-428; 042-108-554-770-743; 045-304-341-837-630; 048-889-201-158-674; 049-007-929-029-76X; 049-604-801-970-089; 050-253-407-854-518; 053-700-538-957-999; 057-434-389-432-158; 058-571-827-675-115; 058-789-805-485-427; 059-578-321-252-615; 060-748-407-187-900; 060-778-427-738-113; 062-173-665-198-934; 064-189-590-701-302; 064-571-881-246-925; 064-696-104-463-06X; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-583-756-505-85X; 071-011-326-519-531; 071-138-612-242-850; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-315-728-261-014; 077-199-101-572-900; 082-391-920-356-292; 086-214-041-467-250; 090-119-692-686-771; 092-307-014-407-121; 092-960-334-718-350; 093-902-625-829-836; 097-404-538-289-898; 099-794-213-253-183; 104-898-249-163-45X; 112-861-932-104-607; 113-589-999-041-758; 113-973-431-964-847; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-324-638-338-136; 120-204-913-104-353; 120-378-004-521-686; 122-591-600-217-184; 123-238-467-675-125; 139-529-800-153-576; 140-940-121-070-504; 144-747-377-111-26X; 152-851-921-965-411; 153-174-100-314-196; 186-479-589-178-971; 194-903-265-762-557,113

Two kinds of adaptation can be clearly distinguished. The first, known as level adaptation, refers to the shift of the neutral perception level to the average stimulus value. It results in a single reference point and stimuli changes represented in absolute terms. This concept is employed by Prospect Theory, which assumes that gains and losses are perceived as monetary amounts. The second kind of adaptation refers to the adjustment of perception sensitivity to stimuli range. It results in two reference points (minimum and maximum stimulus) and stimuli changes perceived in relative terms. Both range adaptation and range relativity are well documented phenomena and have even been confirmed by the creators of Prospect Theory. This makes room for another decision making theory based on the range relativity approach. As shown by Kontek (2009), such a theory would not require the concept of probability weighting to describe lottery experiments or behavioral paradoxes.",,,,,Stimulus (physiology); Theory of relativity; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Weighting; Perception; Lottery; Decision theory; Prospect theory; Relative term,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/12025205 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/25169/ https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID1679447_code1308756.pdf?abstractid=1679447&mirid=5&type=2 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12025205.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.1679447,,10.2139/ssrn.1679447,1952422039,,0,001-444-401-468-83X; 002-551-237-052-786; 010-537-381-624-338; 013-559-199-310-603; 016-252-193-617-543; 017-496-414-606-512; 020-465-113-350-150; 027-387-189-082-686; 038-916-938-137-059; 040-312-170-816-12X; 041-099-511-255-284; 041-659-281-349-623; 043-906-351-820-176; 045-609-050-812-924; 046-307-360-447-582; 055-010-172-721-512; 063-725-936-457-07X; 073-636-733-613-448; 085-357-510-646-393; 087-023-866-663-875; 089-880-374-528-924; 090-975-103-607-767; 094-544-156-461-74X; 097-734-204-632-846; 098-634-083-999-892; 107-627-259-720-365; 113-267-285-721-100; 113-854-477-171-349; 116-555-481-537-920; 126-457-328-841-815; 126-788-041-218-969; 137-074-194-504-469; 144-212-955-750-864; 146-467-665-859-64X; 164-264-186-337-935; 176-263-552-819-688; 188-250-367-856-308; 199-041-932-603-150,0

Participants included 16 female and 14 male Taiwanese college students [age range, 20–26 years (M = 21.92, SD = 2.13)]. Subjects were instructed to perform a series of comparative judgments in which they carefully observed a standard stimulus color under illuminated LEDs and judged which of five simultaneously presented colors under illuminant D65 was the most similar to the standard color. Data analysis revealed that the effect of visual environment on accuracy of color judgments against the standard was significant.

Tan; Renbo Zhao,"We study the top-$K$ ranking problem where the goal is to recover the set of top-$K$ ranked items out of a large collection of items based on partially revealed preferences. We consider an adversarial crowdsourced setting where there are two population sets, and pairwise comparison samples drawn from one of the populations follow the standard Bradley-Terry-Luce model (i.e., the chance of item $i$ beating item $j$ is proportional to the relative score of item $i$ to item $j$), while in the other population, the corresponding chance is inversely proportional to the relative score. When the relative size of the two populations is known, we characterize the minimax limit on the sample size required (up to a constant) for reliably identifying the top-$K$ items, and demonstrate how it scales with the relative size. Moreover, by leveraging a tensor decomposition method for disambiguating mixture distributions, we extend our result to the more realistic scenario in which the relative population size is unknown, thus establishing an upper bound on the fundamental limit of the sample size for recovering the top-$K$ set.",,,,,Statistics; Sample size determination; Minimax; Population size; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Population; Mathematics; Adversarial system; Upper and lower bounds,,,,,https://128.84.21.199/abs/1602.04567?context=math https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04567 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1602.04567 https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.04567v1 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04567v1,https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04567,,,2286476584,,0,001-004-209-528-581; 002-978-775-225-739; 003-674-431-352-228; 003-722-377-136-05X; 010-132-302-334-522; 010-136-645-510-231; 012-557-853-347-940; 018-737-369-727-390; 021-526-803-476-474; 023-478-492-046-416; 024-124-516-766-230; 050-442-961-595-51X; 050-943-988-713-681; 058-104-682-014-099; 073-591-412-378-911; 074-192-297-373-637; 075-351-098-567-027; 078-757-726-772-849; 087-991-691-200-809; 109-668-006-494-690; 110-964-710-349-077; 136-510-755-969-787; 155-939-465-707-798; 170-911-634-334-179; 172-137-286-231-28X; 172-520-776-223-903; 177-673-112-405-471; 181-375-967-075-390,2

Observers compared the sizes of semicircles presented haploscopically via color filters. The main factor under study was viewing mode (free viewing versus short presentations under central fixation). To eliminate response bias, a three-response format allowed observers to respond if the left, the right, or neither semicircle appeared larger than the other. To control decisional (criterion) bias, measurements were taken with the lens-magnified stimulus placed on the left and on the right. To control for size-color illusions, measurements were made with color filters in both arrangements before the eyes and under binocular vision (without color filters).; ; RESULTS; ; Free viewing resulted in a systematic underestimation of lens-induced aniseikonia that was absent with short presentations. Significant size-color illusions and decisional biases were found that would be mistaken for aniseikonia unless appropriate action is taken.; ; CONCLUSIONS; ; To improve their validity, aniseikonia tests should use short presentations and include control conditions to prevent contamination from decisional/response biases. If anaglyphs are used, presence of size-color illusions must be checked for.; ; TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE; ; We identified optimal conditions for administration of aniseikonia tests and appropriate action for differential diagnosis of aniseikonia in the presence of response biases or size-color illusions.

The objective of this paper is to demonstrate that a comparative approach cannot exist without a transcendental dimension. Contrary to Sen, who claims that a transcendental theory is neither necessary nor sufficient in order to frame comparative judgments, it is shown that a transcendental dimension is a necessary, albeit not sufficient, condition of any comparative approach.

Keane,"Pairwise comparison (PC) is a well-established method to assist decision makers in estimating their preferences. In PCs, the acquired judgments are used to construct a PC matrix (PCM) that is used to check whether the inconsistency in judgments is acceptable or requires revision. The use of Consistency Ratio (CR)—a widely used measure for inconsistency—has been widely debated and the literature survey has identified a need for a more appropriate measure. Considering this need, a new measure, termed congruence, is proposed in this paper. The measure is shown to be useful in finding the contribution of individual judgments toward overall inconsistency of a PCM and, therefore, can be used to detect and correct cardinally inconsistent judgments. The proposed measure is applicable to incomplete sets of PC judgments without modification, unlike CR which requires a complete set of PC judgments. To address ordinal inconsistency, another measure termed dissonance, is proposed as a supplement to the congruence measure. The two measures appear useful in detecting both outliers and the phenomenon of consistency deadlock where all judgments equally contribute toward the overall inconsistency.",242,2,557,567,Decision support system; Machine learning; Data mining; Congruence (geometry); Artificial intelligence; Deadlock; Pairwise comparison; Literature survey; Mathematics; Outlier; Ordinal number; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor242.html#SirajMK15 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ejores:v:242:y:2015:i:2:p:557-567 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2014.10.024 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221714008455 https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/contribution-of-individual-judgments-toward-inconsistency-in-pairwise-comparisons(19163a63-5477-438f-8b30-4b0aea188d3d).html https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:291290 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/2301961/manuscript.pdf https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/contribution-of-individual-judgments-toward-inconsistency-in-pairwise-comparisons(2a1dcecb-f058-4750-9a7d-cf5c8a7a2fbd).html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221714008455 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v242y2015i2p557-567.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/111438252.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2014.10.024,,10.1016/j.ejor.2014.10.024,1979390539,,0,004-293-390-041-809; 006-292-024-020-432; 009-881-393-198-900; 010-836-835-875-247; 011-837-366-431-74X; 014-008-170-232-731; 015-050-303-686-75X; 017-424-948-415-144; 021-444-151-543-58X; 025-923-213-645-762; 028-454-054-636-147; 028-670-665-747-31X; 028-779-896-801-757; 031-167-148-604-214; 032-096-904-158-91X; 033-329-743-223-303; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-581-610-717-836; 038-422-867-345-423; 038-523-104-433-065; 039-724-098-680-971; 042-899-084-409-323; 044-335-259-419-953; 047-321-877-806-477; 050-893-547-167-002; 051-525-616-582-208; 061-703-176-018-76X; 067-143-980-711-210; 074-540-793-271-865; 076-710-417-981-320; 076-832-738-066-049; 077-594-222-249-149; 081-375-572-498-166; 084-734-387-214-396; 092-561-349-524-139; 093-539-423-650-420; 093-888-371-798-938; 095-984-756-205-948; 096-491-048-968-304; 101-859-588-779-696; 106-967-560-410-264; 108-824-900-774-73X; 117-126-983-912-867; 119-566-848-981-204; 124-606-723-982-996; 145-355-889-376-580; 153-023-983-223-870,34

The first two phases suggested that creative work could be digitized with adequate fidelity, and that students could submit their own work from schools to an online portfolio system. These portfolios were assessed using online tools to facilitate both an analytical and comparative judgment method of scoring, with the latter appearing to be the more reliable. In the final phase this approach was evaluated to facilitate moderation and professional learning of standards with rural teachers.

Stark,"Schools with the highest average student performance are often the smallest schools; localities with the highest rates of some cancers are frequently small and the effects observed in clinical trials are likely to be largest for the smallest numbers of subjects. Informal explanations of this ""small-schools phenomenon"" point to the fact that the sample means of smaller samples have higher variances. But this cannot be a complete explanation: If we draw two samples from a diffuse distribution that is symmetric about some point, then the chance that the smaller sample has larger mean is 50\%. A particular consequence of results proved below is that if one draws three or more samples of different sizes from the same normal distribution, then the sample mean of the smallest sample is most likely to be highest, the sample mean of the second smallest sample is second most likely to be highest, and so on; this is true even though for any pair of samples, each one of the pair is equally likely to have the larger sample mean. ; Our conclusions are relevant to certain stochastic choice models including the following generalization of Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment. There are $n$ items. Item $i$ is preferred to item $j$ if $Z_i p_2 > \cdots > p_n$. Our results are most surprising when $\mathbb{P}\{Z_i Z_j\} = \frac{1}{2}$ for $i \ne j$, so neither of any two items is likely to be preferred over the other in a pairwise comparison.",,,,,Normal distribution; Statistics; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Sample mean and sample covariance; Pairwise comparison; Mathematics,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5924 https://www.arxiv.org/abs/1409.5924 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1409.5924 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5924v2 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2014arXiv1409.5924E/abstract,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1409.5924,,,2521327901,,0,003-042-756-512-183; 007-870-099-559-561; 021-526-803-476-474; 042-470-726-858-023; 058-310-338-398-932; 062-850-874-367-39X; 081-337-149-860-255; 081-364-096-317-630; 083-888-092-788-347; 086-940-458-280-324; 088-185-235-230-617; 092-474-419-202-077; 102-315-706-433-057; 129-999-083-527-144; 145-069-531-384-730; 179-549-164-047-279,1

Miñano; Pablo Benítez,"The scope of the present paper is the derivation of a merit function which predicts the visual perception of LED spot lights. The color uniformity level Usl is described by a linear regression function of the spatial color distribution in the far field. Hereby, the function is derived from four basic functions. They describe the color uniformity of spot lights through different features. The result is a reliable prediction for the perceived color uniformity in spot lights. A human factor experiment was performed to evaluate the visual preferences for colors and patterns. A perceived rank order was derived from the subjects’ answers and compared with the four basic functions. The correlation between the perceived rank order and the basic functions was calculated resulting in the definition of the merit function Usl. The application of this function is shown by a comparison of visual evaluations and measurements of LED retrofit spot lamps. The results enable a prediction of color uniformity levels of simulations and measurements concerning the visual perception. The function provides a possibility to evaluate the far field of spot lights without individual subjective judgment. © (2014) COPYRIGHT Society of Photo-Optical Instrumentation Engineers (SPIE).

Farran; Yannick Courbois; Danielle Matthews,"Wayfinding is defined as the ability to learn and remember a route through an environment. Previous researchers have shown that young children have difficulties remembering routes. However, very few researchers have considered how to improve young children's wayfinding abilities. Therefore, we investigated ways to help children increase their wayfinding skills. In two studies, a total of 72 5-year olds were shown a route in a six turn maze in a virtual environment and were then asked to retrace this route by themselves. A unique landmark was positioned at each junction and each junction was made up of two paths: a correct path and an incorrect path. Two different strategies improved route learning performance. In Experiment 1, verbally labeling on-route junction landmarks during the first walk reduced the number of errors and the number of trials to reach a learning criterion when the children retraced the route. In Experiment 2, encouraging children to attend to on-route junction landmarks on the first walk reduced the number of errors when the route was retraced. This was the first study to show that very young children can be taught route learning skills.

052-789-768-154-523,R. Duncan Luce (1925–2012),2012-09-27,2012,journal article,"Science (New York, N.Y.)",10959203; 00368075,American Association for the Advancement of Science,United States,James L. McClelland,"Robert Duncan Luce, a mathematician who sought to provide axiomatic formulations for the social sciences, died on 11 August 2012 in Irvine, California, at the age of 87. His passing was marked by an outpouring of sadness at the loss of a revered colleague and expressions of veneration for his many substantive, institutional, and personal contributions to the mathematical social sciences.; ; Luce was a mathematician before he was a social scientist. His achievements cut across the political, social, economic, and social sciences for over 60 years. These contributions were recognized early in his career, with election to the U.S. National Academy of Sciences in 1972, and later at the highest level, with the U.S. National Medal of Science in 2003.; ; Luce received his Ph.D. in mathematics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in 1950, with a thesis that addressed a topic in abstract algebra. His first publication applied ideas from this field to provide a mathematical definition of a “clique” within a social network, and explored using a matrix to capture the connections among individuals that might also be represented in a graph. This method has become standard in computer science, with applications across the social sciences and many other branches of science.; ; In the 1950s, Luce tackled the problem of choice. His seminal treatment of this issue in his 1959 book, Individual Choice Behavior: A Theoretical Analysis , provided the foundation for a vast range of investigations in psychology and economics. In essence, he proposed an abstract and general axiom that gives rise to the following principle of choice: The relative probability ( p ) of choosing item a or item b is independent of other available choices. Suppose in a choice between an apple and a banana, you choose the apple two-thirds of the time, and the banana one-third of the time, for a probability ratio of 2:1. If I add a third choice (a pear), then you might sometimes choose the pear, but the ratio of apple to banana choices should still be 2:1. Luce showed that if his general axiom is true, we can define for each item a positive strength S , such that whatever the set of alternatives, p(a)/p(b) = S(a)/S(b) . Luce's theory was important, not because it was true—although there are circumstances in which it is approximately true—but because its success or failure can lead to insight into the processes underlying choices and decisions. A great deal of work since Luce's theoretical analysis explores the situations in which his theory may be right or wrong.; ; ![Figure][1] ; ; CREDIT: PHOTO BOUTIQUE; ; In the 1960s, and for the rest of his career, Luce's focus shifted to fundamental questions of measurement, with a particular emphasis on measuring psychological quantities such as value or loudness. Social scientists distinguish between physical quantities such as units of sound intensity or ounces of gold, on the one hand, and psychological variables such as perceived loudness and value or utility on the other; the behavioral and economic actions of individuals, groups, and organizations depend on the psychological quantities involved. From the 1960s onward, Luce sought to establish fundamental principles relevant to the measurement of these psychological quantities. In joint work with the statistician John Tukey in 1964, Luce showed that experiments simultaneously varying the effects of two factors on a simple response measure can allow the establishment of unique functions characterizing the effect of each factor—provided, as in the choice work, some simple and intuitively plausible axioms apply. For example, suppose we create batches of cookies, varying the size of each cookie in the batch and the number of cookies in the batch; we present people with choices between two batches, each with a different combination of cookie size and cookie number; and we simply ask each participant to say which batch they would prefer. Then, if the axioms hold for their responses (and if we collect sufficient judgments), we can reconstruct unique functions indicating how size and number affect perceived desirability of a batch of cookies. In this way, psychological forms (and other forms) of measurement can proceed with nothing more than comparative judgments of desirability. This is useful because explicit estimates of perceived value are easily influenced and may not measure the factors that determine preference when faced with a real choice between alternatives. The approach is widely used in perceptual psychology, behavioral economics, and throughout the social and decision sciences. Luce continued to reflect on the fundamental measurement issues until the end of his career, collaborating with other mathematically inclined social scientists, including Louis Narens and Patrick Suppes.; ; Luce's career took him to many institutions, including Harvard University, Columbia University, the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton, the University of Pennsylvania, and the University of California, Irvine. In 1988, he began a second stint at Irvine as a Distinguished Professor of Cognitive Sciences and Economics to found the Institute for Mathematical Behavioral Sciences, where he explored the foundations of measurement.; ; A generous supporter of colleagues and a careful mentor, Luce contributed in many quiet ways to advance the goals of the social and behavioral sciences. He was instrumental in creating the Journal of Mathematical Psychology , and played a lead role in several multivolume works, including the Handbook of Mathematical Psychology and the Foundations of Measurement .; ; Luce saw the marriage of mathematics and behavioral science as a gamble. After receiving the National Medal of Science from President George W. Bush, he said, “I guess that 1950 gamble back at MIT paid off.” It certainly paid off for our understanding of human behavior.; ;  [1]: pending:yes",337,6102,1619,1619,Behavioral economics; Epistemology; Perceptual psychology; Psychology; Mathematical psychology; Axiom; Medal; Statistician; Behavioural sciences; Social network; Environmental ethics,,"Behavior; History, 20th Century; History, 21st Century; Humans; Mathematics/history; Psychology/history; United States",,,https://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1619.full https://www.sciencemag.org/lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1229851 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23019641 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Sci...337.1619M/abstract http://science.sciencemag.org/content/337/6102/1619.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1126/science.1229851,23019641,10.1126/science.1229851,2039457911,,0,,0

To address this issue, this paper proposes a method that uses an analytic hierarchy process group decision (AHPGD) to evaluate the load state of server nodes. Training was carried out by using a hybrid hierarchical genetic algorithm (HHGA) for optimizing a radial basis function neural network (RBFNN). The AHPGD makes the aggregative indicator of virtual machines in cloud, and become input parameters of predicted RBFNN. Also, this paper proposes a new dynamic load balancing scheduling algorithm combined with a weighted round-robin algorithm, which uses the predictive periodical load value of nodes based on AHPPGD and RBFNN optimized by HHGA, then calculates the corresponding weight values of nodes and makes constant updates. Meanwhile, it keeps the advantages and avoids the shortcomings of static weighted round-robin algorithm.",5,1,1989,,Scheduling (computing); Distributed computing; Data mining; Load balancing (computing); Virtual machine; Cloud storage; Dynamic load balancing; Computer science; Cloud computing; Analytic hierarchy process; Genetic algorithm,Analytic hierarchy process (AHP); Cloud storage; Group decision; HHGA (hybrid hierarchical genetic algorithm); Load balancing; Radial basis function neural network (RBFNN),,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN); National Natural Science Foundation of China (CN),https://springerplus.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40064-016-3619-x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5114220 https://paperity.org/p/78156961/load-balancing-prediction-method-of-cloud-storage-based-on-analytic-hierarchy-process-and https://core.ac.uk/display/81754581 https://springerplus.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40064-016-3619-x https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40064-016-3619-x https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81754581.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40064-016-3619-x,27917360,10.1186/s40064-016-3619-x,2552606217,PMC5114220,0,002-664-519-787-191; 003-469-763-330-516; 005-816-478-754-703; 006-484-558-616-982; 007-508-549-577-82X; 007-883-787-802-775; 008-627-391-542-421; 010-219-865-649-618; 016-074-050-390-362; 016-859-410-662-641; 018-167-448-389-869; 021-375-686-719-661; 022-430-696-735-863; 022-748-887-826-012; 025-192-553-715-150; 029-794-988-464-577; 030-661-930-862-448; 036-313-711-691-156; 037-254-128-171-419; 039-212-726-081-349; 039-456-163-689-422; 041-294-595-667-510; 049-807-784-529-880; 050-658-731-904-199; 053-207-390-040-228; 053-524-258-949-10X; 064-577-427-495-62X; 066-663-723-259-326; 068-369-080-680-082; 069-520-084-269-958; 071-183-101-615-769; 083-280-481-021-611; 089-909-662-182-784; 091-459-513-023-620; 093-361-141-878-86X; 096-943-542-468-166; 097-603-069-617-976; 098-031-876-449-775; 131-208-684-204-971; 135-662-806-607-089; 154-160-851-929-406,4

Erchull,"Objective: To provide an explanation of perceived susceptibility judgment that accounts for both inconsistencies among commonly used measures of perceived susceptibility (i.e., absolute risk, direct comparative risk, and indirect comparative risk) and their inconsistent relationships to disease risk factors. Inconsistencies are attributed to differential processing of general versus personal risk factors, coupled with the method of computation of the risk measures. Design and Measures: Study 1 characterized risk factors as general versus personal. In Studies 2 and 3, community-residing adult women (ns = 432 and 147, respectively) rated perceived susceptibility to osteoporosis, breast cancer, heart disease, and diabetes, rated risk factors, and reported personal medical history. Results: Correlations and regression analyses mainly supported our characterization of the source of inconsistencies among susceptibility measures and their relationships to risk factors. Conclusion: Perceived susceptibility measures are not interchangeable and can lead to opposite conclusions about correlates of perceived susceptibility. Researchers are cautioned against using indirect comparative measures, computed as difference scores, and are encouraged to use other methods to compel participants to consider the risk of others when making comparative judgments.",29,1,20,28,Absolute risk reduction; Surgery; Risk perception; Vulnerability; Medical history; Adult women; Disease risk; Clinical psychology; Medicine; Regression,,Adult; Attitude to Health; Female; Health Status; Humans; Judgment; Male; Psychology/methods; Risk Assessment,,,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0016623 https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/perceived-susceptibility-measures-are-not-interchangeable-absolut https://asu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/perceived-susceptibility-measures-are-not-interchangeable-absolut http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20063932,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0016623,20063932,10.1037/a0016623,2016348045,,0,003-258-105-238-013; 003-285-539-803-159; 007-235-613-104-859; 011-527-465-210-762; 012-419-306-168-454; 014-250-530-986-293; 016-603-299-967-543; 019-200-757-553-43X; 026-387-449-478-155; 027-028-772-478-173; 027-508-203-485-595; 033-854-303-896-964; 033-974-226-683-856; 034-645-167-848-735; 038-796-562-786-232; 040-269-259-341-705; 041-032-792-463-250; 046-352-600-258-872; 050-571-363-543-18X; 052-403-526-079-618; 054-163-434-118-897; 055-556-708-628-67X; 072-850-977-359-272; 076-391-942-699-520; 076-464-946-996-930; 076-726-072-796-619; 085-431-311-486-246; 087-824-245-766-759; 091-598-132-703-964; 108-227-936-150-296; 109-008-575-641-474; 116-274-486-110-685; 159-661-462-203-107; 161-286-724-383-946; 166-148-082-833-226,38

A university student must go through several stages in carrying out lab work. The problem arising is at the assessment stage, where lab work lecturers find it difficult to determine the ranking of lab work assessment for each student. The more criteria and alternative assessments arise, the more difficult it will be for the lab work lecturers to determine the priority of lab work participants' scores. This study focuses on making a fuzzy-based acquisition system which is the measurement result data in the lab work process. Furthermore, the data which have been determined by fuzzy with the provisions of the specified criteria, the entire criteria in the lab work process were used by analytic hierarchy process (AHP) method which was integrated in the web server application. The hierarchy levels represented the criteria for the lab work process, namely: pretest, lab work implementation, post test and lab work report-making. The implementation of lab work drawn from fuzzy output was one of the highest weight input criteria. The alternative used was a number of students attending the lab work, using AHP stages, including: decomposition, comparative judgment, synthesis of priority and logical consistency. This system was able to show the accuracy level with fuzzy and to select priorities from the assessment criteria and alternative lab work participants. The findings showed that the fuzzy-based data acquisition was able to provide recommendations for measurements on lab work based on the scores of membership degree and fire strength chosen with an error of less than 5%. The use of AHP was able to give the assessment priority to a number of criteria and alternative lab work assessments with the priority score from student 1 was 0.292, student 2 was 0.233, student 3 was 0.214 and student 4 was 0.261.",,,,,Industrial engineering; Data acquisition; Application server; Ranking; Logical consistency; Fuzzy analytic hierarchy process; Hierarchy; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=8884220 http://xplorestaging.ieee.org/ielx7/8873544/8884215/08884220.pdf?arnumber=8884220,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/isemantic.2019.8884220,,10.1109/isemantic.2019.8884220,2982478146,,0,009-881-393-198-900; 033-010-552-337-872; 076-732-669-626-955; 106-621-708-148-98X; 128-339-611-782-086; 131-246-939-821-62X; 148-638-603-922-419; 184-585-123-403-66X,0
054-085-669-117-230,Ranking from Pairwise Comparisons : The Role of the Pairwise Preference Matrix,,2016,dissertation,,,,,Arun Rajkumar,"Ranking a set of candidates or items from pair-wise comparisons is a fundamental problem that arises in many settings such as elections, recommendation systems, sports team rankings, document rankings and so on. Indeed it is well known in the psychology literature that when a large number of items are to be ranked, it is easier for humans to give pair-wise comparisons as opposed to complete rankings. The problem of ranking from pair-wise comparisons has been studied in multiple communities such as machine learning, operations research, linear algebra, statistics etc., and several algorithms (both classic and recent) have been proposed. However, it is not well under-stood under what conditions these different algorithms perform well. In this thesis, we aim to fill this fundamental gap, by elucidating precise conditions under which different algorithms perform well, as well as giving new algorithms that provably perform well under broader conditions. In particular, we consider a natural statistical model wherein for every pair of items (i; j), there is a probability Pij such that each time items i and j are compared, item j beats item i with probability Pij . Such models, which we summarize through a matrix containing all these pair-wise probabilities, have been used explicitly or implicitly in much previous work in the area; we refer to the resulting matrix as the pair-wise preference matrix, and elucidate clearly the crucial role it plays in determining the performance of various algorithms. ; In the first part of the thesis, we consider a natural generative model where all pairs of items can be sampled and where the underlying preferences are assumed to be acyclic. Under this setting, we elucidate the conditions on the pair-wise preference matrix under which popular algorithms such as matrix Borda, spectral ranking, least squares and maximum likelihood under a Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model produce optimal rankings that minimize the pair-wise disagreement error. Specifically, we derive explicit sample complexity bounds for each of these algorithms to output an optimal ranking under interesting subclasses of the class of all acyclic pair-wise preference matrices. We show that none of these popular algorithms is guaranteed to produce optimal rankings for all acyclic preference matrices. We then pro-pose a novel support vector machine based rank aggregation algorithm that provably does so. ; In the second part of the thesis, we consider the setting where preferences may contain cycles. Here, finding a ranking that minimizes the pairwise disagreement error is in general NP-hard. However, even in the presence of cycles, one may wish to rank 'good' items ahead of the rest. We develop a framework for this setting using notions of winners based on tournament solution concepts from social choice theory. We first show that none of the existing algorithms are guaranteed to rank winners ahead of the rest for popular tournament solution based winners such as top cycle, Copeland set, Markov set etc. We propose three algorithms -…",,,,,Statistical model; Support vector machine; Matrix (mathematics); Generative model; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Recommender system; Theoretical computer science; Markov chain,,,,,https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=oai\:etd.iisc.ac.in\:2005\%2F3787,https://oatd.org/oatd/record?record=oai\:etd.iisc.ac.in\:2005\%2F3787,,,2851004352,,0,035-776-610-863-582; 050-943-988-713-681; 059-321-700-976-097; 061-281-147-794-498; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-440-208-613-022; 073-563-475-784-273; 074-476-690-145-141; 082-860-067-851-737; 087-991-691-200-809; 092-798-854-976-238; 094-222-344-008-721; 096-979-791-156-213; 134-196-819-138-355; 137-940-671-974-155; 161-247-307-055-667; 187-586-878-559-842; 196-686-533-213-568,1

Schneider; Marcell Komlos,"Recently, M. Carrasco, S. Ling, and S. Read (2004) reported that transient visual attentional cues could increase the perceived contrast of Gabor grating targets. We replicated their study using their exact stimuli and procedures. While we were able to reproduce their results, we discovered that the reported attentional effects vanished when we changed the type of decision that subjects performed from a comparative judgment (""which target has higher contrast?"") to an equality judgment (""are the two targets equal in contrast?"") that is resistant to bias. To ensure that the difference between the judgments was not due to a difference in attentional strategies, we also performed a control experiment in which subjects were instructed on a trial-by-trial basis which judgment to perform only after the stimuli had disappeared. In this experiment, the magnitude of attentional effect for the comparative judgment was diminished but still significant and the equality judgment still measured no effect. We conclude that the reported effects of attention upon appearance can be entirely explained by decision bias, and that attention does not alter appearance.",8,15,3,3,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Decision bias; Observer variation,,,,,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19146287/ https://philpapers.org/rec/SCHABD https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2193168 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19146287,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/8.15.3,,10.1167/8.15.3,1998986665,,0,003-234-688-368-621; 006-890-882-656-98X; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-941-661-113-334; 011-601-854-227-368; 012-135-065-483-474; 018-475-871-856-107; 018-902-176-159-944; 019-907-085-939-215; 022-035-864-030-513; 031-324-485-402-628; 035-841-298-157-47X; 041-100-240-098-090; 045-888-090-626-055; 047-123-318-345-961; 050-954-310-099-079; 051-153-997-966-867; 056-928-581-862-768; 061-493-249-815-530; 072-716-995-023-45X; 087-923-864-184-997; 088-426-994-574-490; 097-048-130-494-312; 097-250-909-662-702; 097-265-704-743-738; 101-718-592-082-454; 114-902-585-779-941; 163-307-707-970-578,98

However, it is an open question whether inversion of decades and units also influences number processing beyond the two-digit number range. The current study addresses this question by investigating compatibility effects in both German- (a language with inverted) and English-speaking (a language with non-inverted number words) university students (mean age 22 years) in a three-digit number comparison task. We observed reliable hundred-decade as well as hundred-unit compatibility effects for three-digit number comparison. This indicates that, comparable two-digit numbers, three-digit numbers are processed in a parallel decomposed fashion. However, in contrast to previous results on two-digit numbers as well as on children’s processing of three-digit numbers, no reliable modulation of these compatibility effects through language was observed in adults. The present data indicate that inversion-related differences in multi-digit number processing are limited. They seem to be restricted to the number range involving those digits being inverted (i.e., tens and units in two-digit numbers) but do not generalize to neighboring digits. Possible reasons for this lack of generalization are discussed.",6,,1216,1216,German; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Digit number; Magnitude processing; Mean age; Computer science; Numerical cognition; Inversion (meteorology); Arabic numerals,compatibility effects; developmental changes; language-moderated effects; multi-digit number comparison; three-digit numbers,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01216/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01216/abstract https://philpapers.org/rec/BAHOTL http://www.leibnizopen.de/suche/handle/20.500.12034/499 https://www.psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/499 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/68030 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4532912 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26322010 https://core.ac.uk/display/43821544 https://www.psycharchives.org/bitstream/20.500.12034/499/1/12_fpsyg-06-01216.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01216/pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82863376.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01216,26322010,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.01216,1595346622,PMC4532912,0,001-748-233-366-772; 007-445-821-779-485; 009-001-856-306-982; 010-200-782-431-170; 011-607-161-696-53X; 015-997-859-145-379; 018-734-806-413-581; 018-962-250-936-284; 021-901-356-850-672; 025-402-033-432-459; 026-112-118-134-347; 026-245-238-703-46X; 027-797-536-732-199; 028-950-609-255-958; 030-220-142-452-292; 035-452-245-818-650; 048-280-422-733-636; 050-226-266-734-956; 050-713-173-535-34X; 051-686-139-649-760; 052-282-457-923-273; 055-703-657-280-446; 055-735-581-155-767; 058-621-398-966-143; 059-648-960-770-823; 060-778-427-738-113; 061-744-752-906-732; 067-185-839-037-47X; 072-592-899-801-854; 075-343-615-965-825; 075-801-056-667-527; 076-198-381-713-008; 078-910-008-070-12X; 080-307-144-100-405; 083-408-184-903-503; 084-471-884-845-429; 084-525-058-359-286; 086-214-041-467-250; 089-318-935-543-107; 110-049-094-732-398; 133-092-718-573-072; 140-400-662-583-719; 170-052-077-415-28X; 185-114-216-616-539,7

Tsang; Daniel L. Schwartz; Vinod Menon,"Unlike natural numbers, negative numbers do not have natural physical referents. How does the brain represent such abstract mathematical concepts? Two competing hypotheses regarding representational systems for negative numbers are a rule-based model, in which symbolic rules are applied to negative numbers to translate them into positive numbers when assessing magnitudes, and an expanded magnitude model, in which negative numbers have a distinct magnitude representation. Using an event-related fMRI design, we examined brain responses in 22 adults while they performed magnitude comparisons of negative and positive numbers that were quantitatively near (difference 6). Reaction times for negative numbers were slower than positive numbers, and both showed a distance effect whereby near pairs took longer to compare. A network of parietal, frontal, and occipital regions were differentially engaged by negative numbers. Specifically, compared to positive numbers, negative number processing resulted in greater activation bilaterally in intraparietal sulcus (IPS), middle frontal gyrus, and inferior lateral occipital cortex. Representational similarity analysis revealed that neural responses in the IPS were more differentiated among positive numbers than among negative numbers, and greater differentiation among negative numbers was associated with faster reaction times. Our findings indicate that despite negative numbers engaging the IPS more strongly, the underlying neural representation are less distinct than that of positive numbers. We discuss our findings in the context of the two theoretical models of negative number processing and demonstrate how multivariate approaches can provide novel insights into abstract number representation.",6,,7,7,Psychology; Negative number; Neuroscience; Natural number; Representational systems; Intraparietal sulcus; Middle frontal gyrus; Prefrontal cortex; Integer; Posterior parietal cortex,"distance effect; integers; negative numbers, intraparietal sulcus; number cognition; prefrontal cortex; representational similarity; symbolic number comparisons",,,NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD045914) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD047520) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R01 HD059205) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R37 HD045914) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3277269 https://doaj.org/article/493e497fbeec4f4f8f594cf857301102 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007/pdf http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/82842775 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22363276 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82842775.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007,22363276,10.3389/fnhum.2012.00007,2161008354,PMC3277269,0,003-028-967-630-066; 003-103-573-735-452; 003-505-102-647-896; 003-726-761-941-73X; 003-756-834-371-246; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-310-088-623-140; 007-277-389-709-508; 007-813-269-551-300; 007-914-700-592-576; 008-660-756-899-541; 009-804-637-120-597; 010-187-743-570-895; 010-711-712-458-479; 011-748-038-309-820; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-715-023-202-849; 017-207-483-707-903; 025-950-638-432-192; 026-984-197-942-948; 027-993-890-042-631; 028-644-687-563-504; 028-908-173-804-813; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-176-592-076-025; 032-307-821-561-743; 032-635-789-049-979; 035-552-279-767-677; 044-186-465-627-626; 049-994-837-180-464; 050-724-386-017-961; 054-930-904-508-879; 060-748-407-187-900; 062-738-367-496-162; 066-451-801-924-025; 069-372-329-808-306; 069-586-547-920-957; 080-338-731-761-293; 097-733-487-569-343; 100-875-691-519-87X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 116-232-656-200-937; 120-378-004-521-686; 122-423-243-764-899; 136-677-506-324-800; 142-731-526-580-221,24

BWS avoids, like all discrete choice experiments, the known weaknesses of rating and ranking scales. However, BWS promises to generate additional information because participants choose two times, namely the best as well as the worst alternative.

Lourenco; Matthew R. Longo,"Behavioral demonstrations of reciprocal interactions among the dimensions of space, number, and time, along with evidence of shared neural mechanisms in posterior parietal cortex, are consistent with a common representational code for general magnitude information. Although much recent speculation has concerned the developmental origins of a system of general magnitude representation, direct evidence in preverbal infants is lacking. Here we show that 9-month-olds transfer associative learning across magnitude dimensions. For example, if shown that larger objects were black and had stripes and that smaller objects were white and had dots, infants expected the same color-pattern mapping to hold for numerosity (i.e., greater numerosity: black with stripes; smaller numerosity: white with dots) and duration (i.e., longer-lasting objects: black with stripes; shorter-lasting objects: white with dots). Cross-dimensional transfer occurred bidirectionally for all combinations of size, numerosity, and duration. These results provide support for the existence of an early-developing and prelinguistic general magnitude system, whereby representations of magnitude information are (at least partially) abstracted from the specific dimensions.",21,6,873,881,Psychology; Direct evidence; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Reciprocal; Size Perception; Associative learning; Communication; Magnitude (mathematics); Color vision; Posterior parietal cortex,,"Color Perception; Discrimination, Psychological; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Psychology, Child; Size Perception; Space Perception; Time Factors",,NICHD NIH HHS (R03 HD059993) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R03 HD059993-01A1) United States; NICHD NIH HHS (R03HD059993) United States,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797610370158 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20431048 http://www.psychology.emory.edu/cognition/lourenco/lab/Articles/Lourenco%20&%3b%20Longo%20(2010)%20-%20Psych%20Science.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2930776/ http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0956797610370158 https://bbk.ac.uk/psychology/bodylab/docs/lourenco&longo-psychsci-2010.pdf http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2010/04/27/0956797610370158.abstract https://open.library.emory.edu/publications/emory:v2hjr/ http://www.psy.cmu.edu/~siegler/121-lourenco-longo10.pdf http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/5402/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/141216993.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0956797610370158,20431048,10.1177/0956797610370158,2152633749,PMC2930776,0,000-138-877-275-062; 001-244-253-407-376; 004-961-011-433-134; 005-511-550-795-992; 009-896-047-256-276; 011-247-436-249-24X; 013-038-761-988-056; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-531-593-130-097; 020-845-292-590-09X; 020-997-963-038-216; 022-940-546-349-633; 024-607-781-626-606; 028-134-064-500-611; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-869-715-499-155; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-080-984-994-496; 041-442-979-711-770; 044-174-445-877-224; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-346-642-507-912; 050-789-048-535-501; 054-939-978-733-674; 057-349-983-849-38X; 058-165-959-905-011; 061-533-012-864-522; 062-048-899-665-467; 065-366-926-645-561; 072-507-549-846-500; 092-568-831-144-646; 102-755-968-592-356; 104-898-249-163-45X; 105-720-326-776-873; 114-914-937-496-207; 133-323-798-067-270; 139-708-795-933-36X; 147-553-361-290-631; 167-388-826-583-987; 175-417-961-076-582; 177-015-691-281-199,266

Richard Eiser,"The present research investigated accessibility effects on comparative self-positivity in the environmental domain. In a pretest we established comparative self-positivity and a focus effect for environmental awareness. In the main study we aimed at shifting these effects by manipulating the accessibility of harmful behaviours of either the self or the typical student before obtaining comparative judgements. Specifically, we used two types of accessibility manipulations: anchoring and ease of retrieval. We predicted that judgements would be affected by content in the anchoring paradigm but by subjective ease in the ease of retrieval paradigm. We found the predicted pattern of effects, but it was strongest when participants focused on the typical student. The findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying comparative biases and may have applied implications.

The present longitudinal study investigated the developmental trajectories of numerical processing in 42 children with age-adequate arithmetic development and 41 children with dyscalculia over a 2-year period from beginning of Grade 2, when children were 7; 6 years old, to beginning of Grade 4. A battery of numerical processing tasks (dot enumeration, non-symbolic and symbolic comparison of one- and two-digit numbers, physical comparison, number line estimation) was given five times during the study (beginning and middle of each school year). Efficiency of numerical processing was a very good indicator of development in numerical processing while within-task effects remained largely constant and showed low long-term stability before middle of Grade 3. Children with dyscalculia showed less efficient numerical processing reflected in specifically prolonged response times. Importantly, they showed consistently larger slopes for dot enumeration in the subitizing range, an untypically large compatibility effect when processing two-digit numbers, and they were consistently less accurate in placing numbers on a number line. Thus, we were able to identify parameters that can be used in future research to characterize numerical processing in typical and dyscalculic development.

056-285-533-277-920,A process analysis of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus.,2013-05-27,2013,journal article,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,16625102,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Raymond P. Kesner,"Abstract From a behavioral perspective the CA3a,b subregion of the hippocampus plays an important role in the encoding of new spatial information within short-term memory with a duration of seconds and minutes. This can easily be observed in tasks that require rapid encoding, novelty detection, 1-trial short- term or working memory, and 1-trial cued recall primarily for spatial information. These are tasks that have been assumed to reflect the operations of episodic memory and require interactions between CA3a,b and the dentate gyrus via mossy fiber inputs into the CA3a,b. The CA3a,b is also important for encoding of spatial information requiring the acquisition of arbitrary and relational associations. All these tasks are assumed to operate within an autoassociative network function of the CA3 region. The CA3a,b also supports retrieval of short-term memory information based on a spatial pattern completion process. Based on afferent inputs into CA3a,b from the dentate gyrus (DG) via mossy fibers and afferents from the entorhinal cortex into CA3a,b as well as reciprocal connections with the septum, CA3a,b can bias the process of encoding utilizing the operation of spatial pattern separation and the process of retrieval utilizing the operation of pattern completion. The CA3a,b also supports sequential processing of information in cooperation with CA1 based on the Schaffer collateral output from CA3a,b to CA1. The CA3c function is in part based on modulation of the DG in supporting pattern separation processes.",7,,78,78,Encoding (memory); Psychology; Neuroscience; Working memory; Dentate gyrus; Pattern completion; Schaffer collateral; Entorhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Episodic memory,CA3; associative processes; memory; pattern completion; rapid encoding,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3664330 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23750126/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82867210 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Kesner/publication/237085098_A_process_analysis_of_the_CA3_subregion_of_the_hippocampus/links/0a85e52f112760a282000000.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23750126 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078/abstract https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82867210.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078,23750126,10.3389/fncel.2013.00078,2038513471,PMC3664330,0,001-740-929-023-245; 001-983-738-406-864; 002-114-557-881-65X; 003-115-182-404-128; 003-250-016-250-356; 004-073-488-611-844; 005-230-777-005-480; 005-309-415-702-766; 006-064-194-133-371; 007-023-855-587-895; 007-472-920-746-615; 007-817-357-440-465; 007-933-480-913-713; 008-729-687-771-60X; 009-058-041-709-788; 009-666-718-705-711; 010-310-821-484-206; 010-365-859-345-074; 010-587-774-685-049; 010-595-782-667-086; 010-707-834-603-425; 011-757-607-570-549; 011-930-492-364-513; 012-454-288-338-336; 012-584-536-339-836; 013-084-967-051-661; 013-792-248-941-446; 013-866-390-076-210; 014-244-315-155-744; 014-689-286-651-344; 014-891-989-023-060; 014-926-103-220-127; 015-582-942-418-564; 015-789-369-936-446; 016-298-055-488-302; 017-337-210-834-726; 019-303-201-415-105; 020-509-349-353-739; 020-604-192-575-485; 021-076-341-831-033; 021-594-847-608-154; 022-822-585-426-737; 023-255-081-688-141; 023-533-660-411-611; 024-099-414-817-875; 024-443-971-670-503; 024-955-502-398-665; 026-154-484-191-523; 026-300-907-908-331; 027-627-856-292-290; 029-905-583-852-714; 030-802-317-699-538; 032-252-535-762-493; 033-319-248-110-441; 033-859-292-256-154; 034-707-884-972-06X; 035-685-850-112-397; 036-464-127-683-059; 037-136-972-184-672; 037-743-643-744-047; 038-055-102-680-770; 038-365-458-685-015; 040-317-869-942-536; 040-585-680-645-299; 041-331-820-504-161; 041-712-329-795-252; 043-149-623-846-383; 043-205-473-155-408; 043-911-303-121-764; 044-144-034-480-17X; 044-971-255-581-07X; 045-908-960-331-492; 046-783-708-771-349; 047-269-542-598-826; 048-209-268-809-10X; 048-631-295-740-180; 049-021-957-361-605; 049-143-609-387-994; 049-860-583-948-600; 050-171-503-757-081; 050-412-286-857-303; 050-695-353-577-209; 050-806-728-076-97X; 051-055-041-266-664; 051-723-328-133-819; 053-514-210-395-68X; 053-873-194-151-435; 054-545-096-555-616; 055-300-967-753-409; 057-904-745-736-523; 057-908-306-275-372; 058-260-141-137-138; 060-452-277-749-254; 063-875-013-866-645; 065-836-585-364-553; 067-978-518-590-987; 069-057-230-254-163; 070-455-679-501-91X; 072-508-846-029-982; 072-904-248-565-616; 073-409-106-297-204; 073-801-131-427-775; 078-363-217-288-440; 081-103-690-318-761; 081-487-577-006-024; 082-297-965-078-918; 083-354-491-680-679; 085-416-937-134-407; 085-778-568-332-851; 087-420-968-186-052; 087-724-639-391-613; 088-077-123-563-275; 088-600-892-119-367; 092-839-488-315-277; 095-509-266-443-043; 097-153-938-928-181; 098-442-822-028-015; 100-829-335-987-944; 102-235-883-696-042; 104-456-638-171-818; 105-604-383-955-722; 106-792-977-107-752; 111-556-285-672-351; 113-663-502-010-618; 115-700-169-686-085; 116-966-512-495-943; 117-478-672-448-509; 122-602-169-555-370; 126-517-380-881-98X; 133-699-427-949-309; 136-377-746-210-402; 140-919-725-143-632; 141-928-094-235-995; 143-559-414-459-00X; 145-585-225-851-338; 148-065-468-888-987; 152-534-030-049-656; 157-232-557-465-355; 160-149-651-959-459; 161-471-192-209-270; 162-045-520-108-853; 175-999-757-221-722; 176-017-510-665-867; 179-233-802-025-971,55

The current study asked how automatic is the processing of numerosity and whether automatic activation is task dependent. Participants were presented with displays containing a variable number of digits and were asked to pay attention to the number of digits or to their numerical value, in separate blocks. Effects of task were tested with a comparative judgment task and a parity judgment task. In the comparative judgment task, participants had to indicate whether the numerosity or the numerical value of the digits was smaller or larger than 5. In the parity judgment task, participants had to indicate whether this value was odd or even. Irrelevant numerical values modulated performance regardless of task. In contrast, irrelevant numerosities modulated performance only in the comparative judgment task. These results suggest that numerical value is activated automatically, whereas activation of numerosity is modulated by task. We suggest that the differences observed are related to different cognitive and neural mechanisms recruited by these tasks.",36,4,1053,1059,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Stroop effect; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Mathematical ability; Variable number; Automaticity; Subitizing,,Adult; Analysis of Variance; Automatism; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Mathematics; Mental Processes/physiology; Neuropsychological Tests; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Young Adult,,Israel Science Foundation,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0019766 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20565221 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ889629,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0019766,20565221,10.1037/a0019766,2002382530,,0,001-244-253-407-376; 004-079-468-869-677; 004-604-506-792-053; 005-676-148-028-678; 012-627-787-071-501; 014-084-284-358-994; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-353-433-193-425; 016-148-665-120-122; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 018-686-781-967-92X; 019-101-139-562-44X; 023-254-266-920-133; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-842-221-342-270; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-781-820-914-931; 035-402-974-768-248; 038-121-216-951-260; 038-395-026-012-885; 041-398-777-156-814; 042-852-220-542-295; 044-545-624-765-56X; 046-361-747-944-505; 048-830-545-060-535; 050-920-091-472-041; 052-234-615-510-321; 055-598-356-707-467; 056-211-202-629-678; 061-266-607-128-096; 061-503-605-759-480; 066-089-489-617-442; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-033-829-394-657; 071-274-642-268-839; 076-605-956-275-199; 080-256-567-079-241; 103-009-877-225-341; 104-898-249-163-45X; 120-891-934-941-617; 123-238-467-675-125; 144-747-377-111-26X; 164-046-578-199-011,18

The method does not use QALYs (quality adjusted life years). Its main point is that it tries to avoid comparative judgement on the relative value of treatment effects in different medical areas. The present contribution assesses the controversy that has arisen over IQWiG's methods by discussing a) whether comparative judgements will at least implicitly be made anyway as soon as the IQWiG makes reimbursement recommendations in more than one medical area, and b) whether the well-known fairness objections against QALY maximization can plausibly be dealt with by equity weigthing or, generally, by moving on to ""societal value"" maximization, which tries to include fairness values in addition to cost-effectiveness. It is concluded that the answer is ""No"" for both points, which leads to a ""No"" for the title question as well.",135,12,582,585,Actuarial science; Relative value; Judgement; Equity (finance); Excellence; Reimbursement; Cost effectiveness; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Quality-adjusted life year; Medicine; Economics,,"Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods; Germany; Models, Econometric; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality-Adjusted Life Years",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20234995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1249215,20234995,10.1055/s-0030-1249215,2402429743; 2324962258; 2464741769,,0,,4

Richard Eiser; Sabine Pahl; Yvonne R.A. Prins,"Abstract Two studies (Ns = 234 and 179) are reported in which students made comparative assessments of their own and others' prospects of future examination performance, either by rating themselves in comparison to “typical others” (self–other focus) or by rating “typical others” in comparison to themselves (other–self focus). Participants also provided separate (absolute) estimates for self and others in terms of an evaluative scale and predicted grades. In both studies, under self–other focus, comparative estimates correlated positively with self-estimates but not with other-estimates; under other–self focus, comparative estimates correlated positively with self-estimates and negatively with other-estimates. These findings suggest that unrealistic optimism and better-than-average effects previously found with self–other comparisons primarily reflect self-evaluations rather than the use of a normative standard. Comparative judgments also showed more relative optimism, or positivity, for the self under self–other than under other–self focus. This is applied to predictions of exam performance (both studies), ratings of behavior relevant to exam performance (Study 1), and predictions of future outcomes in the domains of health, achievement, and personal relationships (Study 2).

Rising performance of employees causes advance in both financial and non-financial side. As a new and popular management topic; reward management consists of analyzing and controlling benefits including remuneration and development for the employees. The aim of reward management is to create an efficient reward structure to operate within the whole organization. Objective of reward management is to reward employees fairly. Reward management used for motivating employees to work towards achieving the goals of the organization. The reward usually known as pay but Reward management is not only concerned with pay. It is concerned with employee benefits, non-financial rewards (training, development, and environment) to increase the organization flexibility and success. The purpose of this paper is to examine the reward management as a framework in terms of four main criteria (Pay, Benefits, Learning and Development, Work Environment) and three sub-criteria for each main criterion.

Recent studies demonstrated that released exosomes which contain a subset of both cellular mRNA and miRNA could be a useful source of biomarkers for cancer detection. Here, we aim to develop a novel biomarker for breast cancer diagnosis using exosomal miRNAs in plasma. Methods: We have developed a rapid and novel isolation protocol to enrich tumor-associated exosomes from plasma samples by capturing tumor specific surface markers containing exosomes. After enrichment, we performed miRNA profiling on four sample sets; (1) Ep-CAM marker enriched plasma exosomes of breast cancer patients; (2) breast tumors of the same patients; (3) adjacent non-cancerous tissues of the same patients; (4) Ep-CAM marker enriched plasma exosomes of normal control subjects. Profiling is performed using PCR-based array with human microRNA panels that contain more than 700 miRNAs. Results: Our profiling data showed that 15 miRNAs are concordantly up-regulated and 13 miRNAs are concordantly down-regulated in both plasma exosomes and corresponding tumors. These account for ∼25% (up-regulation) and ∼15% (down-regulation) of all miRNAs detectable in plasma exosomes. Our findings demonstrate that miRNA profile in EpCAM-enriched plasma exosomes from breast cancer patients exhibit certain similar pattern to that in the corresponding tumors. Based on our profiling results, plasma signatures that differentiated breast cancer from control are generated and some of the well-known breast cancer related miRNAs such as miR-10b, miR-21, miR-155 and miR-145 are included in our panel list. The putative miRNA biomarkers are validated on plasma samples from an independent cohort from more than 100 cancer patients. Further validation of the selected markers is likely to offer an accurate, noninvasive and specific diagnostic assay for breast cancer.

Furthermore, Healthcare Building Sustainability Assessment (HBSA) Methods are based on criteria organised into different levels, such as categories and indicators. These criteria highlight aspects of significant importance when designing and operating a sustainable healthcare building. To bring more objectivity to the sustainability assessments, the standardisation bodies (CEN and ISO) proposed core indicators that should be used in the evaluation of the environmental, societal and economic performances of buildings. Nevertheless, relying on state of the art analysis, it is possible to conclude that there are aspects of major importance for the operation of healthcare buildings that are not considered in the HBSA methods. Thus, the aim of this paper is to discuss the context of sustainability assessment methods in the field of healthcare buildings and to present a proposal for the incorporation of Sustainable-Effective Design (SED) criteria in a new HBSA method. The used research method is innovative since in the development of the list of sustainability criteria it considers the opinion of main healthcare buildings' stakeholders, the existing healthcare assessment methods and the ISO and CEN standardisation works in the field of the methods to assess the sustainability of construction works. As a result, the proposed method is composed of fifty-two sustainability indicators that cover the different dimensions of the sustainability concept to support decision making during the design of a new or retrofitted healthcare building in urban areas.",67,,49,60,Engineering; Health care; Process management; Sustainability organizations; Objectivity (philosophy); Building life cycle; Art analysis; Assessment methods; Portuguese; Sustainability; Environmental planning,,,,Portuguese Foundation for Science and Technology,https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/bitstream/1822/46384/1/2696-MFCastro_RMateus_LBraganca_EIR2017.pdf https://repositorium.sdum.uminho.pt/handle/1822/46384 https://core.ac.uk/display/132797475 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195925516303134 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132797475.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eiar.2017.08.005,,10.1016/j.eiar.2017.08.005,2753697872,,0,003-081-682-875-089; 006-007-413-781-694; 008-082-122-546-945; 010-977-864-925-302; 016-014-578-619-036; 016-470-524-425-104; 018-126-224-997-784; 018-357-456-503-761; 019-397-723-108-620; 030-567-488-314-404; 031-714-377-021-274; 033-667-740-476-550; 034-078-928-615-568; 044-217-591-253-599; 065-775-879-635-463; 068-888-663-515-390; 074-082-272-998-019; 080-374-904-670-532; 083-598-068-157-582; 087-124-133-541-910; 089-185-801-437-601; 102-716-123-592-563; 106-043-361-843-307; 109-386-080-905-19X; 129-932-503-927-253; 147-067-465-063-958; 153-335-502-564-889; 166-582-759-691-672,10

Prior research; has shown that human judges are generally good at making unbiased estimates of; sample properties. However, a series of recent applied consumer research; experiments demonstrated a systematic bias in comparative judgments of item; distributions in which the individual items are paired across those distributions, for; example comparing the prices in two stores selling the same items. When the two; distributions have the same mean, the distribution with the higher number of items; that are smaller in magnitude than the equivalent item in the other distribution is; typically judged to be the smaller of the two distributions: a frequency bias. In a; series of experiments, the research in this thesis provides a robust demonstration of; the frequency bias and explores possible explanations for the bias. A comparison; between simultaneous and sequential presentation of information demonstrates that; the frequency bias cannot solely be explained by the salience of the frequency cue.; A novel web-based experiment, in which information was sampled incidentally from; the environment and a naturalistic task was used to elicit comparative judgments,; showed that the frequency effect persists in an ecologically-valid context. A; systematic comparison between alternative cognitive models of the judgment process; supports an explanation in which items are recalled from memory and compared in a; pair-wise fashion, meaning the frequency bias may be found in a wide range of other; judgment tasks and domains, which would have significant implications for our; understanding of intuitive comparative judgments.",,,,,Econometrics; Psychology; Cognition; Salience (language); Consumer research; Frequency effect,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.532069 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/3916/,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.532069,,,626561544,,0,053-817-577-704-440; 068-308-956-834-228; 091-994-127-736-045; 109-981-379-043-471; 140-256-011-672-116,0

Most of these methods are subjected to a complex analysis. The Bradley-Terry model is a probability model for paired evaluations. Although this model is usually known for its application to calculating probabilities, it can be also extended for ranking factors based on pairwise comparison. This application is much less used; however, this work shows that it can provide advantages, such as greater simplicity than traditional multiple-criteria decision methods in some contexts. This work presents a method for ranking the perspectives and indicators of a balance scorecard when the opinion of several decision-makers needs to be combined. The data come from an elicitation process, accounting for the number of times a factor is preferred to others by the decision-makers in a pairwise comparisons. No preference scale is used; the process just indicates the winner of the comparison. Then, the priority weights are derived from the Bradley-Terry model. The method is applied in a Financial Software Factory for demonstration and validation. The results are compared against the application of the AHP method for the same data, concluding that despite the simplifications made with the new approach, the results are very similar. The study contributes to the multiple-criteria decision-making domain by building an integrated framework, which can be used as a tool for scorecard prioritization.",8,2,276,,Finance; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Balanced scorecard; Software factory; Driving factors; Bradley–Terry model; Decision methods; Computer science; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,Gobierno del Principado de Asturias,https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/2/276/htm https://www.mdpi.com/2227-7390/8/2/276/pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/math8020276,,10.3390/math8020276,3006844409,,0,000-064-088-863-321; 001-251-477-004-192; 003-343-346-254-125; 004-107-553-174-752; 008-318-184-571-749; 008-400-306-798-435; 009-512-884-769-006; 009-881-393-198-900; 010-930-609-080-674; 018-269-445-638-29X; 023-842-582-092-844; 025-009-658-071-875; 025-319-583-119-013; 026-140-166-599-34X; 026-358-629-546-378; 026-420-415-358-253; 028-454-054-636-147; 028-900-912-419-323; 030-733-094-692-470; 031-830-169-787-740; 036-665-091-243-991; 036-784-682-767-502; 037-423-792-391-123; 042-797-857-313-378; 045-897-463-088-371; 046-645-764-444-881; 047-941-883-449-215; 048-024-663-664-413; 052-391-493-372-344; 054-244-923-299-670; 058-426-338-000-677; 067-431-637-655-975; 072-053-634-214-774; 098-507-541-834-429; 117-685-294-391-657; 124-171-041-782-890; 129-713-292-530-060; 130-500-642-565-893; 147-318-292-418-805; 148-447-739-326-85X; 150-272-182-474-547; 154-556-244-657-593; 157-189-775-028-646; 168-896-029-919-932; 172-659-442-527-284; 175-755-079-554-999; 183-914-972-982-465,0

We use data from three sources: a laboratory experiment, a field study, and a large US supermarket chain, to study the cognitive underpinning and the ensuing asymmetry in rigidity associated with 9-ending prices. We find that consumers use 9-endings as a signal for low prices, and that this signal interferes with price information processing. Consequently, consumers are less likely to notice a bigger price when it ends with 9, or a price increase when the new price ends with 9, in comparison to a situation where the prices end with some other digit. We also find that retailers respond strategically to this consumer bias by setting 9-ending prices more often after price increases than after price decreases. 9-ending prices, therefore, usually increase only if the new prices are also 9-ending. Consequently, there is an asymmetry in the rigidity of 9-ending prices: they are more rigid than non 9-ending prices upward but not downward.",,,,,Financial economics; Limit price; Psychological pricing; Price controls; Economics; Mid price; Price level; Factor price; Monetary economics; Reservation price; Mark to model,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2167662_code66373.pdf?abstractid=2167662&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2167662 http://core.ac.uk/display/12034391 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12034391.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2167662,,10.2139/ssrn.2167662,1718168295,,0,000-264-661-304-415; 000-338-115-597-635; 001-156-039-626-383; 002-368-128-079-562; 003-380-165-782-159; 003-881-229-202-017; 005-516-540-277-414; 008-195-864-769-591; 008-887-219-596-007; 010-717-838-648-603; 012-349-547-003-692; 014-287-614-291-228; 015-850-021-252-860; 016-201-814-744-351; 017-194-514-350-522; 018-775-879-473-295; 019-578-560-766-866; 020-010-346-051-425; 021-361-566-893-924; 021-515-526-986-543; 023-237-912-666-80X; 023-348-477-894-489; 028-004-296-701-118; 028-345-812-035-648; 032-368-195-984-368; 035-344-664-196-149; 036-809-719-615-093; 037-961-372-109-724; 038-283-661-474-126; 039-530-060-043-269; 044-886-849-497-290; 047-605-660-510-944; 049-090-969-043-646; 049-282-891-888-249; 050-688-156-866-671; 050-713-173-535-34X; 052-815-546-916-699; 056-052-492-789-948; 056-672-370-150-588; 057-080-816-653-057; 061-714-331-805-354; 062-494-366-683-427; 063-956-517-618-48X; 064-377-155-917-203; 074-356-321-316-439; 076-524-601-724-122; 079-890-593-792-780; 081-953-499-423-492; 083-671-281-341-555; 093-356-263-635-114; 100-886-723-556-282; 107-306-151-660-551; 108-809-846-681-763; 108-941-170-763-694; 122-451-009-804-766; 127-106-936-900-147; 136-817-535-559-90X; 140-580-100-167-036; 147-673-141-099-671; 152-288-253-146-639; 156-089-678-655-90X; 158-544-687-139-653; 159-735-592-504-345; 161-058-081-077-464; 181-269-920-861-512; 182-088-239-574-145; 184-987-883-115-611; 199-190-131-084-097,3

Further, when items were presented in both modalities simultaneously, large-font/quiet and small-font/loud items received similar JOLs (and were recalled similarly). Most importantly, when the intensity manipulation was compounded across modalities, the magnitude of the illusion increased beyond that observed in a single modality, showing the influence of combining cues. Whereas recall was still the same, large-font/loud items received higher JOLs than either small-font/loud items or large-font/quiet items, and not-intense items received very low JOLs.

Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Marta Castela; Edgar Erdfelder,"The recognition heuristic (RH) theory predicts that, in comparative judgment tasks, if one object is recognized and the other is not, the recognized one is chosen. The memory-state heuristic (MSH) extends the RH by assuming that choices are not affected by recognition judgments per se, but by the memory states underlying these judgments (i.e., recognition certainty, uncertainty, or rejection certainty). Specifically, the larger the discrepancy between memory states, the larger the probability of choosing the object in the higher state. The typical RH paradigm does not allow estimation of the underlying memory states because it is unknown whether the objects were previously experienced or not. Therefore, we extended the paradigm by repeating the recognition task twice. In line with high threshold models of recognition, we assumed that inconsistent recognition judgments result from uncertainty whereas consistent judgments most likely result from memory certainty. In Experiment 1, we fitted 2 nested multinomial models to the data: an MSH model that formalizes the relation between memory states and binary choices explicitly and an approximate model that ignores the (unlikely) possibility of consistent guesses. Both models provided converging results. As predicted, reliance on recognition increased with the discrepancy in the underlying memory states. In Experiment 2, we replicated these results and found support for choice consistency predictions of the MSH.

Finally, we validated critical parameters of our MSH model through a cross-validation method and a third experiment.

Whitty; Courtney J. Wright; Clare Townsend; Dianne Smith; Ali Lakhani; Samantha Kennerley,"Identifying the housing preferences of people with complex disabilities is a much needed, but under-developed area of practice and scholarship. Despite the recognition that housing is a social determinant of health and quality of life, there is an absence of empirical methodologies that can practically and systematically involve consumers in this complex service delivery and housing design market. A rigorous process for making effective and consistent development decisions is needed to ensure resources are used effectively and the needs of consumers with complex disability are properly met. This 3-year project aims to identify how the public and private housing market in Australia can better respond to the needs of people with complex disabilities whilst simultaneously achieving key corporate objectives. First, using the Customer Relationship Management framework, qualitative (Nominal Group Technique) and quantitative (Discrete Choice Experiment) methods will be used to quantify the housing preferences of consumers and their carers. A systematic mixed-method, quasi-experimental design will then be used to quantify the development priorities of other key stakeholders (e.g., architects, developers, Government housing services etc.) in relation to inclusive housing for people with complex disabilities. Stakeholders randomly assigned to Group 1 (experimental group) will participate in a series of focus groups employing Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodology. Stakeholders randomly assigned to Group 2 (control group) will participate in focus groups employing existing decision making processes to inclusive housing development (e.g., Risk, Opportunity, Cost, Benefit considerations). Using comparative stakeholder analysis, this research design will enable the AHP methodology (a proposed tool to guide inclusive housing development decisions) to be tested. It is anticipated that the findings of this study will enable stakeholders to incorporate consumer housing preferences into commercial decisions. Housing designers and developers will benefit from the creation of a parsimonious set of consumer-led housing preferences by which to make informed investments in future housing and contribute to future housing policy. The research design has not been applied in the Australian research context or elsewhere, and will provide a much needed blueprint for market investment to develop viable, consumer directed inclusive housing options for people with complex disability.",16,1,261,261,Blueprint; Marketing; Stakeholder analysis; Consumer behaviour; Needs assessment; Public housing; Focus group; Service delivery framework; Nominal group technique; Medicine; Environmental health,Analytical hierarchical process; Decision making; Disability housing; High care needs; Neurological disability; Public housing; Social housing; Supported housing,Adolescent; Adult; Australia; Caregivers; Choice Behavior; Consumer Behavior; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Disabled Persons/psychology; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Public Housing; Quality of Life; Research Design; Trauma Severity Indices; Young Adult,,Australian Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/43392041 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58364/ https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4791886 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:385016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791886/ https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/99372 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/36936 https://paperity.org/p/75968727/study-protocol-developing-a-decision-system-for-inclusive-housing-applying-a-systematic https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26975348/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81209731.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x,26975348,10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x,2297369105,PMC4791886,0,001-471-193-715-27X; 005-078-809-053-994; 005-354-038-050-362; 005-846-288-491-743; 009-881-393-198-900; 011-318-329-287-385; 016-192-199-262-366; 016-616-121-548-627; 016-865-261-177-44X; 017-424-948-415-144; 018-030-627-289-321; 019-823-865-196-557; 020-197-966-214-005; 020-780-700-688-244; 026-582-284-480-399; 026-728-673-180-065; 027-294-091-539-323; 028-378-730-332-850; 028-417-432-189-514; 029-234-544-863-694; 029-615-367-155-687; 030-628-699-900-194; 032-628-990-718-411; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-301-366-981-700; 037-718-667-935-96X; 038-977-378-775-093; 040-185-137-948-551; 042-627-416-303-850; 044-218-788-214-512; 044-838-550-778-630; 051-987-790-435-795; 054-702-067-377-669; 057-657-809-679-383; 059-079-112-655-817; 064-950-152-959-896; 065-507-676-685-574; 066-441-802-038-704; 072-722-850-081-81X; 080-986-410-560-875; 084-161-402-094-703; 094-617-249-231-649; 095-600-715-094-983; 099-150-317-608-133; 100-699-307-024-742; 122-259-977-999-310; 124-754-008-004-098; 125-513-366-485-249; 128-200-781-285-30X; 130-581-929-817-389; 137-499-750-422-928; 142-967-418-672-453; 146-991-505-732-448; 165-782-043-991-063; 188-993-492-032-663; 192-305-413-301-910,2

Despite the frequent appeal in everyday life to the nihilistic interpretation of the saying ‘It's all a matter of taste’, the doctrine of aesthetic nihilism—the view that such claims are never warranted—does not merit serious attention. What is needed is an articulation of the various kinds of content of aesthetic judgements, one that will reveal what their claim to intersubjective validity amounts to and enable an assessment of what the proper limits of the claim might be. This clarification is what I attempt to provide. After some introductory definitions and classifications, the principal focus of the first part of the paper is descriptive aesthetic judgements, and one issue that figures large is the proper understanding of those judgements of this kind which are expressed in sentences that are intended to be understood metaphorically. A short bridge passage identifies an aesthetic judgement whose content is indicative of the content of evaluative aesthetic judgements of all kinds, and in particular evaluative aesthetic judgements about works of art, which the second part of the paper focuses on. Real illumination of these requires an identification of the aim of art (as such): I offer an account of this aim, which I defend against certain objections that it is liable to attract, and I use it to throw light not just on singular but also on comparative judgements of artistic value. I conclude with some remarks about purely aesthetic value and specifically artistic value and about similarities and differences between evaluative aesthetic judgements of works of art and evaluative aesthetic judgements of works of nature.",47,4,333,371,Aesthetics; Epistemology; Psychology; Doctrine; Judgement; Intersubjectivity; Appeal; Everyday life; Aesthetic value; Expression (mathematics),,,,,http://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/47/4/333/8879/ https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/47/4/333/8879/ https://philpapers.org/rec/BUDTIV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesthj/aym021,,10.1093/aesthj/aym021,2037107229,,0,,10

Field experiments show that information about low absolute and relative performance of local government household waste recycling services lowers citizens' perceptions of performance, and information about high absolute and relative performance raises perceived performance. Relative information makes citizens judge local providers as being more responsible for outcomes in the case of high performance, suggesting that systems for comparative performance reporting increase local accountability for outcomes. Negativity bias is evident, with information about low absolute performance reducing citizens' satisfaction but information about high performance not raising satisfaction. Information about low performance did not trigger collective voice protest behaviour as hypothesized, suggesting that providers who need citizens' collective voice the most do not get it.",92,2,493,511,Business; Publishing; Perception; Accountability; Negativity bias; Local government; Public service; Household waste; Public relations,,,,Economic and Social Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/43095357 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/padm.12066 https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/17877,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/padm.12066,,10.1111/padm.12066,1562493923,,0,000-941-509-572-154; 001-621-310-188-482; 007-818-549-882-924; 008-255-826-726-373; 011-426-974-141-82X; 013-110-753-113-683; 013-870-259-076-233; 014-269-506-262-412; 014-511-986-071-668; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-634-490-603-357; 022-881-674-696-27X; 023-069-203-727-374; 029-091-639-120-134; 033-295-648-776-96X; 033-327-535-043-763; 034-399-776-879-800; 035-361-109-912-403; 036-676-450-208-543; 039-985-452-581-251; 040-941-453-441-286; 044-690-606-042-094; 044-836-639-077-225; 045-090-437-886-17X; 046-602-564-175-891; 047-618-094-446-070; 048-644-046-696-644; 049-578-889-285-345; 049-715-764-848-51X; 052-231-224-637-778; 068-632-516-315-787; 071-213-792-800-940; 071-520-993-317-883; 074-336-553-085-66X; 076-028-477-127-239; 078-066-831-922-105; 079-958-304-213-219; 082-955-500-127-339; 085-466-331-410-265; 087-248-023-920-180; 097-244-124-991-134; 105-433-282-578-290; 106-399-521-161-303; 108-035-087-185-702; 116-294-105-433-439; 122-025-038-375-575; 122-672-880-781-613; 122-913-646-182-705; 124-002-684-685-296; 131-362-686-237-65X; 135-328-416-775-702; 144-385-488-734-35X; 145-659-499-981-024; 145-717-974-988-894; 148-633-129-501-381; 155-447-929-501-480; 160-510-239-453-266; 160-860-357-169-688; 169-324-935-371-641; 185-357-946-893-18X; 186-914-185-154-328; 187-210-619-637-660; 190-740-827-370-485,122

Here a color congruity paradigm was employed and the irrelevant physical sizes were replaced by irrelevant colors. MM, a digit-color synesthete, yielded the classical congruity effect. Namely, she was slower to identify numerically larger numbers when they deviated from her synesthetic experience than when they matched it. In addition, the effect of color on her comparative judgments was modulated by numerical distance. In contrast, performance of non-synesthetes was not affected by the colors. On the basis of neurophysiological studies of magnitude comparison and interference between numerical and physical information, it is proposed that the interaction between colors and digits in MM occurs at the conceptual level.

The first concerns the development of an e-portfolio system that enables learners to capture evidence of their activity (using hand-held devices in the workshop/studio/science lab/playing field) and to lodge it in a web-space where their portfolio emerges dynamically, in real-time. Teachers and examination bodies can interact with this system to a greater or lesser extent according to the circumstances. If the activity is part of a formal examination, then the Awarding Body can specify the task and the activity framework (all of which can be downloaded by the school) and teachers in many schools can then run the same activity in a standard way. If the activity is a normal piece of curriculum, then teachers can design activities for individuals or groups of learners and either run them with the learners, or enable the learners themselves to work through the activity autonomously. In any event, the outcome of all this is a web-portfolio.; The second innovation concerns the assessment of these portfolios. Using comparative judgement and the pairs engine, groups of teachers and/or examiners can collaborate in the assessment of groups of portfolios. This might be for an Awarding Body, with the results counting towards an official award, or it might be within a school, where collaborating teachers use the data for their own purposes. These two innovations were launched in 2009 with the final report of phase 3 of the e-scape project. The purpose of this concluding piece is to reflect on what has happened since then; on the extent to which these innovations have been adopted in various parts of the world and the issues that this adoption is raising. Sometimes the adoption has been of only one of the innovations (either the portfolio-building or the comparative judgement), and sometimes it has been both",22,2,265,270,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-011-9196-y,,10.1007/s10798-011-9196-y,,,0,,2

We propose an insufficient adjustment plus selective accessibility account for these effects. Specifically, judges may adjust from an implausible anchor until a plausible value for the target is reached and may then test the hypothesis that the target’s extension is similar to this value. If this is indeed the case, then differentially extreme implausible anchors should produce similar absolute estimates, because adjustment from any implausible anchor should terminate at the same value. Results of two studies are consistent with this prediction. They show that implausible anchors that differ extremely produce similar absolute estimates. The implications of these findings for alternative models of anchoring are discussed. Human judgment under uncertainty is often influenced by salient judgmental anchors. In what is probably the best known demonstration of such anchoring effects (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), participants first received a comparative judgment task in which they were asked whether the percentage of African nations in the UN is higher or lower than an arbitrary number (the anchor) that had been determined by spinning a wheel of fortune (i.e., 65% or 10%). In the subsequent absolute judgment task, participants were asked to give their",19,2,145,160,Psychology; Anchoring; Salient; Human judgment; Then test; Assimilation (phonology); Social psychology,,,,,http://www.communicationcache.com/uploads/1/0/8/8/10887248/considering_the_impossible_-_explaining_the_effects_of_implausible_anchors.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2001-17820-002 http://core.ac.uk/display/22811183,http://dx.doi.org/10.1521/soco.19.2.145.20705,,10.1521/soco.19.2.145.20705,2153287075,,0,001-586-769-269-55X; 007-793-116-443-610; 012-841-071-082-464; 014-991-755-969-177; 018-427-275-836-357; 022-814-589-152-008; 031-209-604-686-886; 047-627-628-099-945; 061-041-361-921-192; 063-793-155-762-965; 065-785-918-818-668; 085-271-493-217-441; 117-150-305-299-565; 124-538-751-952-258; 130-971-600-994-543; 148-223-435-969-407; 178-207-799-964-074,83

Repeated judgements and the use of a suitable sorting algorithm allow marked to be derived from a rank order of scripts. Feedback can be added to each script as it is judged.; We have evaluated the use of adaptive comparative judgement for peer assessment and feedback using a case study in the third year of a Pharmacy programme. The exercise consisted of five parts each of 100 words.; Each student conducted 10 judgements and left feedback, which was of overall very high quality. The assessment, however, was less successful. Students’ judgements were not very consistent with one another, nor with staff assessment. This contrasts with a previous exercise, in which the student assessment was of high reliability but the feedback was less good.; This exercise was successful in promoting mutual support among students through the giving and receiving of feedback. We conclude, however, that for optimum use of adaptive comparative judgement for peer assessment, a hierarchical marking scheme is required, but students should be encouraged to give feedback on all aspects of the assessment.",12,1,50,60,Sorting algorithm; Psychology; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Mutual support; Peer-to-peer; Peer assessment; Contrast (statistics); Scripting language; Applied psychology,,,,,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/514,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/514,,,2964188169,,0,,0

Smith; Andrew Street,"It has long been standard practice to ask patients in clinical trials about their health status, but the practice is now being extended to patients receiving treatment on a routine basis. In this paper, we examine four types of analyses that these health data might inform: comparisons of alternative treatments for the same condition, of health care providers, of changes in performance over time and of treatments of different types of condition. Analytical challenges arise because counterfactuals cannot be observed and because health status cannot be measured continuously. The implications of these challenges and the ability to meet them vary according to the comparative exercise. We argue that, provided with a sufficient number of health status measures for each patient and proper risk adjustment, health status measurement has great potential to inform the first three types of comparison. However, we believe that it is not yet possible to use such data to make secure comparative judgements about the outcomes from treatment for different types of condition.",22,2,119,131,Psychiatry; Health care; MEDLINE; Outcome assessment; Risk adjustment; Health data; Health outcomes; Family medicine; Clinical trial; Quality-adjusted life year; Medicine,,"Health Status; Humans; Models, Statistical; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patients; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Self Report",,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22238023 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.2793 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22238023 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wly:hlthec:v:22:y:2013:i:2:p:119-131 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22238023/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/hlthec/v22y2013i2p119-131.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.2793,22238023,10.1002/hec.2793,2097536184,,0,002-040-804-305-547; 009-292-193-771-113; 014-300-191-711-158; 014-408-969-415-515; 020-869-666-603-040; 023-726-901-857-333; 028-323-776-645-993; 029-904-470-397-159; 033-213-535-228-64X; 036-146-366-342-485; 042-964-900-308-183; 050-158-259-190-733; 059-161-254-027-448; 078-703-962-067-961; 084-243-561-168-844; 092-650-442-529-588; 100-710-430-255-217; 122-685-609-280-363; 139-702-298-521-199; 183-433-160-467-786,41

On the basis of examples of unjust situations derived from Sen's writings, the article discusses the limited reach of The Idea of Justice in addressing concrete cases of injustice. It contends that remedying injustice requires an understanding of how justice is structural, which recognises that discussion of justice is inseparable from reasoning about the nature of the good society.

As a consequence, this information will be more likely to become the basis for the absolute judgment which will therefore be assimilated toward the anchor. However, if the activated information overlaps with information that is elicited by the absolute judgment itself, the preceding comparative judgment should not exert an incremental effect and should fail to result in an anchoring effect. The present studies find this result when the comparative judgment refers to a general category and the absolute judgment refers to a subset of the general category that was activated by the anchor value. For example, participants comparing the average annual temperature in New York City to a high 102 Â°F judged the average winter, but not summer temperature to be higher than participants making no comparison. On the other hand, participants comparing the annual temperature to a low --4 Â°F judged the average summer, but not winter temperature to be lower than control participants. This pattern of results was shown also in another content domain. It is consistent with the Selective Accessibility Model but difficult to reconcile with other main explanations of the anchoring effect.",11,1,92,98,Congruence (geometry); Psychology; Anchoring; Content domain; Social psychology,,,,,http://www.sjdm.org/journal/15/15613a/jdm15613a.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/jdm/journl/v11y2016i1p92-98.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:jdm:journl:v:11:y:2016:i:1:p:92-98 https://osf.io/fd4vm/#! https://sociorepec.org/publication.xml?h=repec:jdm:journl:v:11:y:2016:i:1:p:92-98&l=en,https://ideas.repec.org/a/jdm/journl/v11y2016i1p92-98.html,,,2301693761,,0,001-371-383-093-944; 002-368-986-577-381; 012-841-071-082-464; 017-456-906-228-902; 018-427-275-836-357; 022-895-487-255-687; 029-296-977-140-639; 031-176-770-098-248; 036-583-878-200-144; 038-542-564-501-704; 061-041-361-921-192; 061-909-808-288-455; 063-793-155-762-965; 066-043-712-129-297; 066-362-433-635-072; 069-727-881-724-448; 070-387-752-002-083; 092-484-265-208-976; 093-215-350-059-996; 107-830-153-098-356; 117-150-305-299-565; 120-010-007-199-447; 121-853-096-503-528; 124-538-751-952-258; 132-914-230-472-749; 133-164-025-998-473; 148-223-435-969-407; 185-138-433-723-804,11

In the condition with auditory information, sounds were heard directly, or through a sound system, which consists of the frequency filters and soundproof box. The other condition without auditory information masks the knocking with white noise. In short, the participants compared hardness through these conditions, and the correctness of their judgement were used to measure the contribution of auditory and tactile senses toward perceiving hardness.

Sus implicaciones sobre la calidad de los medios y su posible asociacion con los comportamientos de las personas en el consumo de noticias justifican su estudio. Este articulo examina la opinion de los espanoles sobre cual es medio con mayor credibilidad. Se explora su asociacion con el genero, edad, nivel de estudios, medio preferido para informarse, nivel de exposicion a las noticias, nivel de diversidad de la dieta mediatica-informativa y patron de consumo habitual de noticias de los encuestados. Se analizan datos de una encuesta suministrada en 2010 a una muestra representativa (n= 1.205) de la poblacion espanola. Los resultados esclarecen que, para la mayoria de los espanoles, la television es el medio mas creible. Sin embargo, los resultados varian segun las caracteristicas individuales de las personas estudiadas. La opinion sobre cual es el medio mas creible esta asociada principalmente al nivel de estudios. Las personas con mayor formacion creen que el medio con mayor credibilidad es la prensa. La asociacion con el patron de consumo habitual de noticias y el medio preferido para informarse sugieren que los encuestados atribuyen mas credibilidad a los medios que consumen habitualmente, por tanto, la credibilidad relativa refleja en mayor medida el grado de afectividad por un medio que un juicio comparativo sobre la veracidad de los contenidos. Credibility is a central topic in the debate about the news media. Several reasons justify its study such as the implication on the news media quality or the possible association with people’s media consume. This paper examines the Spanish public opinion about the news media with the greatest credibility. The association with variables such as gender, age, education, media preference for news, level of news exposure, level of diversity in news media diet, and pattern of news consumption is explored. We analyzed data from a survey conducted in 2010 to a representative sample (n= 1,205) of the Spanish population. The paper concludes that the majority of the sample thinks that the television is the most credible media. However, findings depend on the individual traits of the individuals. The opinion about the most credible news media is mainly associated with education level. The association with pattern of news consumption and media preference suggests that people attribute more credibility to the media they use more often; therefore, relative credibility indicates a signal of affectivity rather than a comparative judgment about the veracity of news contents.",,,,,Art; Humanities; Credibility; Cartography,,,,,,,,,2289213400,,0,000-132-518-211-676; 001-732-710-527-676; 005-113-414-510-450; 011-399-487-495-195; 013-998-551-395-840; 020-987-338-625-221; 025-492-998-505-708; 027-741-544-231-375; 029-241-373-559-115; 029-807-385-208-881; 030-242-276-399-703; 037-021-955-654-652; 037-853-880-895-938; 047-908-823-582-191; 055-889-634-403-608; 064-282-376-172-936; 069-918-774-649-341; 077-339-455-815-49X; 079-337-268-900-158; 083-854-569-425-434; 091-082-371-346-290; 091-663-474-359-671; 115-193-082-686-038; 117-295-997-364-547; 120-143-378-929-17X; 135-697-793-999-932; 149-649-511-143-055; 154-195-615-227-12X; 168-037-364-725-099,0

M. Chandima Ratnayake,"The ‘strategic’ management of technical integrity has become a high profile subject matter over recent years within inspection and maintenance of assets in the process industry. The assets such as production and process facilities require being optimised, prioritised and cost-effective inspection and maintenance, depending on whether they are at the beginning or end of their design life. In both cases, it is vital to ensure that sufficient condition monitoring data from all relevant sources are collated and analysed as a part in a planned scheme of inspection and maintenance. This is largely driven by certifying authority requirements, sound mechanical and corrosion engineering principles as well as inspection and maintenance approaches, indicated in a plant strategy. This manuscript suggests a model to execute plant strategy using analytic hierarchy process method. The model indicates the incorporation of requirements specified in a plant strategy for reaching optimised, prioritised and cost-effective outcome.",4,1/2,1,1,Risk analysis (engineering); Condition monitoring; Process industry; Poison control; Cost effectiveness; Risk management; Computer science; Operations research; Decision model; Strategic management; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://www.inderscience.com/link.php?id=46602 https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijdsrm/v4y2012i1-2p1-24.html https://www.researchgate.net/profile/RM_Ratnayake2/publication/264819213_A_decision_model_for_executing_plant_strategy_maintaining_the_technical_integrity_of_petroleum_flowlines/links/544504290cf2e6f0c0fc4ab0.pdf https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJDSRM.2012.046602 https://brage.bibsys.no/xmlui/handle/11250/195052 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/52083980.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijdsrm.2012.046602,,10.1504/ijdsrm.2012.046602,2166208716,,1,002-842-789-127-176; 004-348-751-680-442; 007-279-856-508-449; 008-003-032-857-207; 009-138-482-810-101; 010-368-651-866-202; 011-952-137-693-782; 015-129-879-901-100; 015-508-529-212-778; 024-615-587-891-051; 039-722-907-929-388; 039-724-098-680-971; 046-784-454-140-882; 049-017-646-915-218; 052-301-663-751-581; 055-097-709-611-802; 056-633-163-352-556; 063-319-652-384-75X; 065-659-266-996-460; 067-341-125-020-782; 071-524-457-330-863; 071-645-568-975-673; 075-134-367-281-65X; 082-986-218-610-329; 088-117-940-964-320; 089-032-455-082-352; 091-826-796-234-824; 099-685-957-171-778; 100-456-092-421-946; 105-221-834-304-331; 113-542-985-694-581; 115-115-752-559-828; 116-791-545-344-875; 128-179-648-459-75X; 131-058-520-553-920; 135-313-085-969-841; 138-778-829-913-218; 139-512-797-581-340; 172-739-646-215-530; 180-433-455-974-516; 184-265-456-449-807; 184-875-544-855-328; 185-702-250-863-657,21
059-396-165-275-462,Toward a Philosophy Of Food History,,2006,journal article,Philosophy Today,00318256; 23298596,Philosophy Documentation Center,United States,S. K. Wertz,"[The French]... talk about talking about food. Gertrude Stein There is a topology of time in regard to food activities which I shall briefly develop here as a context for a philosophical discussion of the history of food. This should help clarify the levels of meaning that are implicit in the phenomena of food. The broadest distinction that can be drawn is between immediate and mediate time. Immediate time, on one hand, is the present and recent past, and within this temporal category we can distinguish between the consumption and preparation of food. Preparation can be further divided into regional (popular) cuisine and erudite (professional) cuisine, as Jean-Francois Revel has done in his book, Culture and Cuisine.1 These different types of cuisine can be further developed along the lines of Slow Food and Fast Food where Revel's interplay between the regional and the erudite disappears and becomes an opposition; see Carlo Petrini's Slow Food: The case for Taste.2 Mediate time, on the other hand, is the connection of food with the remote past. (I shall mainly be preoccupied with this idea.) Several examples come to mind. First is Roland Barthes's ""Sugar and Other Systems"" in which he suggests that food has a commemorative function, i.e., ""food permits a person (and I am here speaking of French themes) to partake each day of the national past.""3 In detail, he says, In this case, the historical quality is obviously linked to food techniques (preparation and cooking). These have long roots, reaching back to the depth of the French past. They are, we are told, the repository of a whole experience, of the accumulated wisdom of our ancestors. ... No doubt the myth of French cooking abroad (or as expressed to foreigners) strengthens this ""nostalgic"" value of food considerably; but since the French themselves actively participate in this myth (especially when traveling), it is fair to say that through his food the Frenchman experiences a certain national continuity. By way of a thousand detours, food permits him to insert himself daily into his own past and to believe in a certain culinary ""being"" of France (87). A good fictional illustration of this point is in Willa Gather's novel, Death Comes for the Archbishop, in which a conversation about a dark onion soup ensues: ""Think of it, Blanchet; in all this vast country between the Mississippi and the Pacific Ocean, there is probably not another human being who could make a soup like this."" ""Not unless he is a Frenchman,"" said Father Joseph. He had tucked a napkin over the front of his cassock and was losing no time in reflection. ""I am not depreciating your individual talent. Joseph,"" the Bishop [Latour] continued, ""but, when one thinks of it, a soup like this is not the work of one man. It is the result of a constantly refined tradition. There are nearly a thousand years of history in this soup.""4 Furthermore, this continuity of culinary ""being"" is a widely-shared belief among the native North American tribes and communities; for instance, Jim Enote of the Zuni Pueblo remarks: ""In essence partaking of food is more than a matter of physical sustenance, it is also a personal ritual to honor the long history of our people, which is a story intimate and dense with meaning.""3 Food ritualizing a national or tribal history and providing a culinary continuity with the past is a premise shared by several cultures. This particular function of food distinguishes the history of food in terms of how it accesses the past, and therefore, this makes the discipline very interesting and at the same time problematic. So the history of food raises some intriguing philosophical questions. For instance, philosophers of history are interested in what sort of judgments are included in a historical narrative and why. I shall took at two of these here: culinary judgments and comparative judgments. Duplication Problem The major historiographical problem of the history of food, as Revel sees it, is this: ""the difficulty when one explores the past (and even the present) lies in appreciating the difference between silent cuisine and cuisine that talks too much, between the cuisine that exists on the plate and the one that exists only in gastronomical chronicles. …",50,2,239,248,Aesthetics; Literature; Sociology; Opposition (planets); Premise; Food history; Honor; Archbishop; Historiography; Narrative history; Mythology,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-1071674421/toward-a-philosophy-of-food-history https://www.pdcnet.org/philtoday/content/philtoday_2006_0050_0002_0239_0248,http://dx.doi.org/10.5840/philtoday200650255,,10.5840/philtoday200650255,42480435,,0,,2

Makhijani; Johan Ugander,"There is a growing need for discrete choice models that account for the complex nature of human choices, escaping traditional behavioral assumptions such as the transitivity of pairwise preferences. Recently, several parametric models of intransitive comparisons have been proposed, but in all cases the model log-likelihood is non-concave, making inference difficult. In this work we generalize this trend, showing that there cannot exist an parametric model that both (i) has a log-likelihood function that is concave in item-level parameters and (ii) can exhibit intransitive preferences. Given this observation, we also contribute a new simple model for analyzing intransitivity in pairwise comparisons, taking inspiration from the Condorcet method (majority vote) in social choice theory. The majority vote model we analyze is defined as a voting process over independent Random Utility Models (RUMs). We infer a multidimensional embedding of each object or player, in contrast to the traditional one-dimensional embedding used by models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) models. We show that a three-dimensional majority vote model is capable of modeling arbitrarily strong and long intransitive cycles, and can also represent arbitrary pairwise comparison probabilities on any triplet. We provide experimental results that substantiate our claims regarding the effectiveness of our model in capturing intransitivity for various pairwise choice tasks such as predicting choices in recommendation systems, winners in online video games, and elections.",,,3056,3062,Condorcet method; Mathematical economics; Majority rule; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Social choice theory; Discrete choice; Parametric model; Intransitivity; Computer science,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3313717 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/www/www2019.html#MakhijaniU19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3308558.3313717,,10.1145/3308558.3313717,2913175021,,0,007-768-226-299-547; 010-546-849-527-109; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-706-620-416-491; 027-150-047-044-961; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-041-395-053-293; 041-857-163-593-884; 044-146-601-077-942; 058-310-338-398-932; 071-975-243-710-417; 073-563-475-784-273; 081-370-959-105-221; 098-376-587-660-420; 105-197-803-566-972; 109-781-082-705-650; 112-714-330-059-351; 123-248-831-556-464; 129-140-863-196-364; 134-578-954-599-166; 158-403-210-085-10X; 177-521-132-361-223; 192-117-215-641-318,3

The difficult interpretation of psychophysical data on time perception,2014-06-10,2014,journal article,Frontiers in human neuroscience,16625161,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Miguel A. García-Pérez,"Time perception is studied with subjective or semi-objective psychophysical methods. With subjective methods, observers provide quantitative estimates of duration and data depict the psychophysical function relating subjective duration to objective duration. With semi-objective methods, observers provide categorical or comparative judgments of duration and data depict the psychometric function relating the probability of a certain judgment to objective duration. Both approaches are used to study whether subjective and objective time run at the same pace or whether time flies or slows down under certain conditions. We analyze theoretical aspects affecting the interpretation of data gathered with the most widely used semi-objective methods, including single-presentation and paired-comparison methods. For this purpose, a formal model of psychophysical performance is used in which subjective duration is represented via a psychophysical function and the scalar property. This provides the timing component of the model, which is invariant across methods. A decisional component that varies across methods reflects how observers use subjective durations to make judgments and give the responses requested under each method. Application of the model shows that psychometric functions in single-presentation methods are uninterpretable because the various influences on observed performance are inextricably confounded in the data. In contrast, data gathered with paired-comparison methods permit separating out those influences. Prevalent approaches to fitting psychometric functions to data are also discussed and shown to be inconsistent with widely accepted principles of time perception, implicitly assuming instead that subjective time equals objective time and that observed differences across conditions do not reflect differences in perceived duration but criterion shifts. These analyses prompt evidence-based recommendations for best methodological practice in studies on time perception.",8,,415,415,Psychophysics; Psychology; Psychometrics; Time perception; Cognitive psychology; Psychophysiology; Perception; Psychometric function; Uninterpretable; Categorical variable; Social psychology,perception of duration; probabilistic models; psychometric function; psychophysical function; psychophysical methods,,,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24959133 https://doaj.org/article/5e3404521d58401c90befa4e13110ced https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00415/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4051264/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4051264 https://core.ac.uk/display/25562413 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00415/abstract https://eprints.ucm.es/35783/ https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2014-45378-001 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82851714.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2014.00415,24959133,10.3389/fnhum.2014.00415,1587821574,PMC4051264,0,000-112-707-760-465; 000-161-395-113-656; 002-961-609-111-110; 003-166-015-289-337; 004-778-725-383-380; 005-309-240-934-37X; 005-475-926-463-289; 006-162-525-655-633; 007-333-722-231-506; 007-935-159-160-363; 008-654-915-629-40X; 008-688-446-714-542; 008-800-372-456-110; 009-020-248-126-164; 010-154-141-098-22X; 010-214-365-005-928; 010-975-409-296-453; 012-137-154-736-348; 012-508-740-895-800; 012-989-783-012-377; 013-150-563-983-799; 013-464-219-367-198; 013-537-464-753-441; 014-789-088-955-10X; 015-164-373-114-859; 023-315-924-035-934; 023-524-604-965-72X; 024-215-642-942-26X; 025-260-535-252-190; 025-681-052-464-020; 026-574-010-726-400; 026-658-441-789-727; 031-249-869-915-820; 031-548-750-166-877; 032-818-328-918-379; 032-953-213-884-529; 033-135-639-129-717; 034-052-479-693-089; 034-833-241-237-333; 035-049-369-083-334; 036-161-930-022-454; 037-412-725-185-676; 037-961-385-622-252; 041-475-105-778-983; 041-663-521-893-233; 042-023-382-285-449; 042-948-432-650-438; 043-287-212-135-531; 046-437-011-788-122; 048-373-971-491-687; 049-052-557-424-429; 049-455-447-685-78X; 049-773-323-519-855; 050-095-717-741-200; 050-683-379-855-846; 051-693-091-004-036; 054-581-153-094-317; 056-558-306-706-220; 058-608-380-157-894; 059-219-555-197-167; 059-741-993-099-585; 059-794-696-770-335; 061-436-587-490-58X; 061-795-910-788-621; 061-993-685-369-291; 062-065-425-913-232; 063-089-740-586-22X; 064-383-996-199-286; 065-580-971-803-474; 066-237-498-238-673; 070-813-577-890-413; 071-965-485-643-641; 074-584-828-437-55X; 075-506-271-598-008; 077-325-418-840-795; 077-669-636-893-608; 080-079-488-432-671; 080-198-836-481-480; 080-570-572-975-994; 083-569-951-314-812; 084-193-570-203-610; 087-919-992-206-677; 088-303-854-941-930; 092-752-016-807-757; 093-561-912-866-047; 096-524-873-684-369; 097-790-557-931-346; 098-605-034-406-998; 102-365-158-200-994; 102-576-473-955-06X; 106-936-798-979-328; 110-851-021-736-855; 117-488-932-781-252; 121-586-148-073-15X; 127-392-585-221-950; 139-176-427-079-396; 139-375-579-233-059; 141-875-014-344-15X; 143-380-954-389-225; 147-989-990-585-819; 156-119-548-171-717; 165-214-620-281-163; 168-421-681-504-632; 176-154-560-723-472; 176-165-860-800-197; 180-891-027-080-047; 195-656-865-139-575,20

In many real-world applications in which preference learning is involved the available training data is scarce and obtaining labeled training data is expensive. Fortunately in many of the preference learning situations data is available from multiple subjects. We use the multi-task formalism to enhance the individual training data by making use of the preference information learned from other subjects. Furthermore, since obtaining labels is expensive, we optimally choose which data to ask a subject for labelling to obtain the most of information about her/his preferences. This paradigm--called active learning--has hardly been studied in a multi-task formalism. We propose an alternative for the standard criteria in active learning which actively chooses queries by making use of the available preference data from other subjects. The advantage of this alternative is the reduced computation costs and reduced time subjects are involved. We validate empirically our approach on three real-world data sets involving the preferences of people.",90,1,1,28,Stability (learning theory); Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Preference learning; Active learning; Multi-task learning; Computer science; Data set; Semi-supervised learning; Active learning (machine learning); Ask price,,,,,https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F103332 https://doi.org/10.1007/s10994-012-5297-4 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10994-012-5297-4/fulltext.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10994-012-5297-4 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ml/ml90.html#BirlutiuGH13 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/bitstream/handle/2066/103332/103332.pdf https://paperity.org/p/7371656/efficiently-learning-the-preferences-of-people https://core.ac.uk/display/81583682 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/103332 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1007/s10994-012-5297-4 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81583682.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10994-012-5297-4,,10.1007/s10994-012-5297-4,2153718513,,0,009-134-360-642-05X; 009-646-242-435-278; 012-367-777-689-406; 016-421-262-575-813; 017-832-085-042-575; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-473-240-411-42X; 020-544-556-184-134; 022-543-305-396-835; 028-244-522-592-144; 029-881-975-308-001; 030-119-363-887-39X; 034-444-995-155-175; 035-729-450-475-801; 039-879-563-481-481; 042-619-340-145-365; 042-674-764-230-952; 045-861-251-076-366; 047-077-704-250-798; 047-082-704-948-48X; 047-912-923-113-01X; 048-583-708-695-75X; 049-336-882-076-346; 052-559-216-867-070; 053-378-196-131-560; 055-981-594-261-44X; 062-216-945-260-509; 063-828-102-408-126; 064-090-245-779-280; 065-387-331-732-335; 067-016-484-735-502; 072-498-419-897-711; 072-558-067-306-114; 075-233-305-172-275; 080-418-584-620-246; 084-459-758-218-916; 087-991-691-200-809; 094-438-334-609-235; 095-563-603-963-814; 097-946-569-334-504; 099-817-204-948-038; 100-927-009-143-702; 101-284-287-211-779; 101-750-936-643-412; 101-851-940-081-945; 102-832-326-188-614; 105-938-017-521-49X; 107-090-004-335-45X; 108-269-703-415-383; 109-108-760-999-206; 112-333-569-359-760; 114-010-046-265-42X; 116-914-500-923-213; 116-923-019-400-058; 120-482-569-783-747; 120-628-434-993-658; 127-569-125-473-349; 127-603-342-201-24X; 130-707-515-090-58X; 133-381-709-624-780; 133-601-204-385-253; 139-693-696-642-584; 140-157-946-304-999; 142-464-566-861-50X; 144-607-646-779-766; 146-240-299-526-661; 147-516-912-068-269; 150-197-039-498-864; 151-797-038-754-796; 155-751-477-363-553; 156-033-866-064-346; 164-933-686-864-892; 171-910-264-815-216; 174-372-150-272-835; 178-856-031-320-546; 182-580-099-253-220; 190-500-027-670-129; 191-177-195-085-673; 196-498-893-277-823; 199-154-210-701-85X; 199-512-156-999-073,18

Riege; Karl Halvor Teigen,"When people are asked to estimate the probabilities for an exhaustive set of more than two events, they often produce probabilities that add up to more than 100%. Potential determinants for such additivity neglect are explored in four experiments. Additive responses vary between experimental conditions, mainly as a result of response format, with a scale format leading to fewer additive responses than a list format with self-generated, written probabilities. Participants with high numeracy scores produced more additive responses, especially after being primed with a numeracy scale. Additivity neglect for 100% sums appears to be unrelated to other subadditive judgments, like non-additive disjunctions.

As many regions the metropolitan region Berlin–Brandenburg struggles to achieve the objectives of the Water Framework Directive until 2015. A major problem is the high load of nutrients. As the region is part of two states (Lander) and the river sections are common throughout the whole region we account for the spatial context twofold. Firstly, we incorporate the distance between each respondent and all river stretches in all MNL and RPL models, and, secondly, we consider whether respondents reside in the state of Berlin or Brandenburg. The compensating variation (CV) calculated for various scenarios shows that overall people would significantly benefit from improved water quality. The CV measures, however, also reveal that not considering the spatial context would result in severely biased welfare measures. While the distance decay effect lowers CV, state residency is connected to the frequency of status quo choices and not accounting for residency would underestimate possible welfare gains in one state. Another finding is that the extent of the market varies with respect to attributes (river stretches) and attribute levels (water quality levels).",5,,49,66,Welfare; Environmental resource management; Econometrics; Metropolitan area; Distance decay; Geography; Willingness to pay; Compensating variation; Water Framework Directive; Water quality; Spatial contextual awareness,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S2212428414000097 http://core.ac.uk/display/19955046 https://www.rti.org/publication/value-water-quality-improvements-region-berlin%E2%80%93brandenburg-function-distance-and-state,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.wre.2014.02.001,,10.1016/j.wre.2014.02.001,1993813189,,0,002-182-787-085-215; 017-697-656-319-680; 019-252-480-164-996; 022-827-481-543-667; 029-775-008-957-410; 031-202-522-523-379; 032-063-833-367-317; 034-359-221-810-31X; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-527-362-678-252; 042-627-416-303-850; 046-309-480-705-936; 047-017-327-139-810; 052-696-195-384-379; 057-624-060-173-047; 057-657-809-679-383; 063-381-443-802-828; 067-069-474-369-210; 068-118-206-590-183; 072-163-313-703-021; 074-071-861-181-580; 080-781-940-683-785; 082-365-922-240-788; 096-368-420-588-428; 098-376-587-660-420; 099-361-053-839-885; 104-488-504-309-822; 108-496-730-640-172; 111-699-411-419-639; 111-709-709-177-413; 118-020-403-059-275; 128-315-979-589-27X; 132-217-484-707-495; 135-334-133-100-589; 160-928-311-809-879; 164-260-106-908-120; 175-728-240-797-003; 193-321-829-780-819,23

060-633-128-145-054,Structure of Linguistic Spatial Representation: A test for psychometric structure using Japanese spatial terms,,2002,,,,,,Takatsugu Kojima; Takashi Kusumi,"The Structure of Linguistic Spatial Representation A test for psychometric structure using Japanese spatial terms Takatsugu KOJIMA (kojima@cpsy.mbox.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp) Takashi KUSUMI (n50609@sakura.kudpc.kyoto-u.ac.jp) Faculty of Education, Kyoto University Sakyo-ku, Kyoto 606-8501 Japan Introduction Although it is not clear whether our system of spatial representation as a whole (integrated spatial representation) is structured initially by perception or by language, it is certain that forms of spatial representation generally are ultimately based largely on perception, especially on vision, and on language. Furthermore, when we encode or categorize forms of spatial representation, we do so following systematic rules that are founded on the structures of spatial representation formed by vision, language and so on. The question remains, then, whether these spatial structures resemble each other? If so, are they grouped in any way? In addition, do they connect with each other, and, if they do, what is the nature of the relation between the specific spatial representational structures formed by vision and by language? According to Hayward and Tarr (1995), the spatial structure encoded by language (e.g., above, below) seems to be based on, and to correspond to, the spatial representational structure based on perception. Crawford, Regier and Huttenlocher (2000), however, have insisted that these structures do not correspond. Both Hayward and Tarr (1995) and Crawford et al (2000) examined this issue from the viewpoint of categorical prototype and boundary. In linguistic spatial categorization, prototypes and boundaries are dependent on what spatial terms are used. Therefore, their method is not appropriate for comparing spatial structures. In this study, instead of prototypes and boundaries, we examined fit patterns for four Japanese spatial terms (ue, shita, hidari, migi) using Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment (case V). From this fit distribution and the prototypical spatial structure of visual representation (Huttenlocher , Hedges, and Duncan, 1991), we investigated whether the spatial structure of perceptual representation corresponds to that of linguistic representation. Method Ten Japanese graduate and undergraduate students participated. Stimuli were generated by an IBM/PC compatible computer and presented on a CRT at a viewing distance of approximately 115cm. For each trial, an instruction word would first appear in the center of the screen for 1000ms. Then, a black square (11°×11° side) was centered as a reference object, and two black dots (0.12°×0.12° diameter) were randomly presented as target objects, occupying 21 fixed locations that were based on a former experiment (Kojima & Kusumi, 2002). Four Chinese characters ( ), each of which expresses spatial locations (e.g.,” (ue)” in Japanese is nearly equal to “above” in English, and, in the same way, “ (shita)” to “below”, “ (hidari)” to “left” and “ (migi)” to right) were used as the instruction words in a square (11°×11° side). The participants were required to compare the locations of the two dots in relation to the reference object, and to choose the dot that best suited the location expressed by the prior instruction word. Results and Discussion The paired comparison data were processed and scaled by Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment (case V). The fit patterns of the four Japanese spatial terms are shown in Fig1, based on scaled value. Here, the width and depth are equivalent to the horizontal and vertical frame lines on the CRT. The height expresses the scaled value (from –3.00 to 3.00). This fit pattern differs from that of the prototypical structure; It shows a less simple gradient pattern. From this pattern and former studies’ result (Huttenlocher et al, 1991), we supported the suggestion of Crawford et.al (2000). That is, we also found that the structure of visual spatial representation does not correspond to the structure of linguistic spatial representation.

When the demands of traffic calming exceed city resources, there is a need to prioritize or rank them. Asian countries, like Japan, Korea, Bangladesh and etc., do not have a prioritization system to apply in such cases. The objective of this research is to develop a point ranking system to prioritize traffic calming projects. Firstly paired comparison method was employed to obtain residents' opinions about the streets severity and needs of traffic calming treatment. A binary logistic regression model was developed to identify the factors of selecting streets for traffic calming. This model also explored the weight of variables during developing the point ranking system. The weights used in the point ranking system include vehicle speed, pedestrian generation, sidewalk condition and hourly vehicle volume per width (m) of street. Results suggest that the severity of street largely depends on the absence of sidewalks, which has a weight of 45%, and high hourly vehicle volume of traffic per width (m) of street, which has a weight of 38%. These outcomes are significant to develop the state of traffic safety in Japan and other Asian countries.",3,4,324,335,Logistic regression; Human factors and ergonomics; Injury prevention; Ranking; Transport engineering; Pedestrian; Traffic calming; Scoring system; Poison control; Computer science,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209575641530605X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209575641530605X#! http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S209575641530605X https://trid.trb.org/view/1423276 https://core.ac.uk/display/82408843 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82408843.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jtte.2016.02.002,,10.1016/j.jtte.2016.02.002,2504415308,,0,000-152-576-424-686; 008-613-859-392-012; 009-266-939-911-743; 011-458-122-591-413; 021-464-284-587-445; 023-231-978-309-98X; 031-938-583-427-075; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-854-530-489-966; 039-308-476-074-109; 042-262-850-601-237; 047-118-628-932-372; 047-356-172-458-900; 056-960-032-927-792; 059-899-367-297-496; 060-275-220-292-594; 064-386-694-320-275; 070-716-184-456-785; 072-432-119-579-736; 082-428-789-334-720; 084-092-451-592-77X; 089-173-673-879-916; 094-019-707-843-758; 104-409-397-312-998; 127-088-487-361-881; 127-389-420-486-312; 136-044-018-906-262; 156-356-987-251-865; 157-745-143-429-139; 164-341-053-536-646; 183-835-251-399-434; 198-754-631-432-902,3

Consequently, benchmarking, which evaluates comparative advantages of leading competitors and identifies best practices, has been employed by many service firms. As part of effort to extend its scope, integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and benchmarking has been proposed in previous research. However, sufficient analysis on activities of both firms, including its own firm and its competitor, was not possible due to the use of a single QFD. In response, this paper suggests a dual QFD as a means for benchmarking service quality. A dual QFD makes it possible to conduct detailed analysis on competitor's activities and on relationship between activities of the two firms, which should be preceded by benchmarking. From the structural perspective, this paper modifies original QFD into dual QFD by relocating benchmarking matrix to the main frame an...",26,5,569,582,Competitor analysis; Service quality; Best practice; Process management; Operations management; Computer science; Comparative advantage; Benchmarking; Quality function deployment,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14783363.2013.860696 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5027213,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14783363.2013.860696,,,2163037314,,0,001-386-828-970-842; 002-187-410-101-601; 002-432-260-051-325; 004-961-082-863-510; 015-804-698-270-465; 018-946-653-183-870; 024-660-841-467-639; 025-022-107-474-80X; 025-721-298-170-077; 029-161-104-682-123; 030-628-234-997-248; 031-873-519-098-831; 036-600-244-715-439; 049-029-493-974-943; 049-947-799-905-863; 075-390-355-403-464; 080-214-100-468-088; 080-491-705-826-904; 084-986-581-370-828; 108-512-420-405-246; 111-698-390-799-534; 117-536-159-928-491; 118-334-576-790-842; 124-890-253-043-927; 133-130-072-766-653; 154-819-770-460-426; 160-350-923-683-690; 173-507-611-729-092,6

Jacobs,"Abstract Introduction The aim of the present study was to probe electrophysiological effects of non-symbolic numerical processing in 20 children with mathematical learning disabilities (mean age = 99.2 months) compared to a group of 20 typically developing matched controls (mean age = 98.4 months). Methods EEG data were obtained while children were tested with a standard non-symbolic numerical comparison paradigm that allowed us to investigate the effects of numerical distance manipulations for different set sizes, i.e., the classical subitizing, counting and estimation ranges. Effects of numerical distance manipulations on event-related potential (ERP) amplitudes as well as activation patterns of underlying current sources were analyzed. Results In typically developing children, the amplitudes of a late parietal positive-going ERP component showed systematic numerical distance effects that did not depend on set size. For the group of children with mathematical learning disabilities, ERP distance effects were found only for stimuli within the subitizing range. Current source density analysis of distance-related group effects suggested that areas in right inferior parietal regions are involved in the generation of the parietal ERP amplitude differences. Conclusion Our results suggest that right inferior parietal regions are recruited differentially by controls compared to children with mathematical learning disabilities in response to non-symbolic numerical magnitude processing tasks, but only for stimuli with set sizes that exceed the subitizing range.",49,8,2162,2177,Developmental psychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Electrophysiology; Right inferior; Eeg data; Magnitude processing; Mathematical learning; Electroencephalography; Subitizing; Audiology,Children; EEG; Mathematical learning disabilities; Non-symbolic numerical comparison; Numerical distance effect,Brain/physiology; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Child; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Female; Humans; Learning Disabilities/physiopathology; Male; Mathematics; Parietal Lobe/physiology,,German Federal Ministry of Education and Research,https://www.uni-trier.de/fileadmin/fb1/prof/PSY/PAE/Team/Schneider/HeineEtAl2013.pdf https://www.research-collection.ethz.ch/handle/20.500.11850/163786 https://core.ac.uk/display/34545814 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945212003280 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23287447 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34545814.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2012.11.009,23287447,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.11.009,2057323326,,0,000-910-388-694-339; 002-866-713-133-779; 003-710-302-053-681; 004-030-636-268-081; 004-079-468-869-677; 004-235-736-539-538; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-427-625-373-902; 005-676-148-028-678; 005-783-682-084-833; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-917-539-894-873; 007-516-922-079-491; 008-266-133-478-809; 008-573-173-860-893; 008-660-756-899-541; 008-969-825-870-669; 009-340-421-889-441; 011-245-515-103-530; 011-744-832-669-630; 012-627-787-071-501; 012-736-317-039-26X; 014-043-776-728-225; 014-175-100-464-076; 014-528-646-212-015; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-456-782-384-125; 015-992-070-091-075; 016-612-841-333-60X; 017-059-553-332-448; 018-303-710-305-792; 018-686-781-967-92X; 018-785-508-118-971; 019-506-603-356-742; 021-566-111-190-893; 021-671-283-817-095; 021-899-860-380-120; 022-049-380-598-783; 022-974-967-046-45X; 023-254-266-920-133; 024-758-969-884-840; 025-950-638-432-192; 026-500-670-371-260; 027-992-812-182-300; 030-087-358-677-263; 032-229-108-136-564; 032-635-789-049-979; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-319-794-069-059; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-236-838-185-699; 037-819-011-672-40X; 038-625-669-399-455; 040-547-950-520-713; 042-108-554-770-743; 042-472-377-164-320; 043-472-308-841-240; 044-022-373-175-932; 045-735-184-813-268; 047-273-277-337-327; 047-440-067-968-409; 049-092-751-377-693; 050-020-384-415-16X; 051-817-564-440-236; 051-839-955-755-136; 052-556-423-157-22X; 053-700-538-957-999; 055-546-309-604-41X; 056-170-806-678-309; 057-877-558-474-926; 058-680-135-645-751; 059-424-379-092-456; 062-656-252-133-557; 064-535-670-863-140; 064-571-881-246-925; 065-383-374-411-605; 066-451-801-924-025; 066-640-891-096-018; 066-946-988-025-939; 067-613-008-303-077; 069-586-547-920-957; 071-572-343-819-86X; 072-157-343-216-127; 072-849-353-462-759; 073-315-728-261-014; 074-441-357-197-861; 076-563-245-610-330; 077-099-180-479-49X; 077-424-863-194-158; 077-764-348-019-938; 078-699-018-002-285; 079-224-041-509-479; 079-692-521-456-908; 081-207-550-644-553; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-502-240-081-234; 089-534-827-525-987; 093-171-874-765-291; 094-114-851-771-555; 095-798-094-700-317; 098-837-745-136-413; 101-450-667-767-630; 104-898-249-163-45X; 105-725-528-808-645; 110-735-271-638-053; 110-878-263-543-335; 113-827-474-759-59X; 113-985-328-659-252; 115-141-525-130-027; 115-773-251-340-945; 116-093-617-267-98X; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-324-638-338-136; 120-204-913-104-353; 126-013-807-290-339; 130-016-791-527-212; 132-102-071-896-363; 144-923-580-981-260; 145-140-986-126-382; 149-190-852-458-200; 152-716-632-064-682; 188-126-485-010-874; 194-903-265-762-557,17

Rodzon; Kerry E. Jordan,"Both time and numerosity can be represented continuously as analog properties whose discrimination conforms to Weber’s Law, suggesting that the two properties may be represented similarly. Recent research suggests that the representation of time is influenced by the presence of emotional stimuli. If time and numerosity share a common cognitive representation, it follows that a similar relationship may exist between emotional stimuli and the representation of numerosity. Here, we provide evidence that emotional stimuli significantly affect humans’ estimation of visual numerosity. During a numerical bisection task, enumeration of emotional stimuli (angry faces) was more accurate compared to enumeration of neutrally valenced stimuli (neutral faces), demonstrating that emotional stimuli affect humans’ visual representation of numerosity as previously demonstrated for time. These results inform and broaden our understanding of the effect of negative emotional stimuli on psychophysical discriminations of quantity.",4,,521,521,Valence (psychology); Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Neuroscience; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Emotional stimuli; Bisection; Numerical cognition,Weber’s Law; emotion; numerical cognition; quantitative discrimination; quantity,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/abstract http://core.ac.uk/display/25902669 https://philpapers.org/rec/BAKTIO-7 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950754 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3739062 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82885793.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521,23950754,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521,2054071718,PMC3739062,0,000-301-185-197-734; 001-347-300-765-064; 003-756-834-371-246; 003-761-055-942-579; 004-731-567-191-050; 004-752-549-821-429; 006-556-515-196-690; 007-982-164-129-004; 007-996-363-197-55X; 008-440-730-412-606; 009-172-333-696-965; 009-420-062-605-493; 009-798-900-720-146; 013-038-761-988-056; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-974-377-547-330; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-678-955-117-94X; 019-490-776-168-383; 020-392-504-269-769; 020-512-833-958-294; 021-693-057-817-131; 022-809-584-107-682; 023-108-369-375-523; 023-637-815-133-879; 024-168-323-406-145; 024-607-781-626-606; 025-411-961-000-469; 025-596-868-936-020; 026-803-444-839-337; 027-885-565-129-778; 029-582-367-526-339; 034-982-292-185-771; 035-933-244-514-345; 037-436-823-090-386; 039-742-935-448-969; 044-388-441-968-173; 046-535-255-782-80X; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-373-971-491-687; 048-952-966-839-251; 049-365-634-170-299; 049-782-484-836-522; 050-025-386-545-745; 051-472-129-782-759; 053-459-828-789-403; 055-643-503-860-593; 057-183-336-446-253; 057-349-983-849-38X; 057-877-558-474-926; 060-645-774-719-735; 064-533-953-664-476; 070-382-759-482-419; 070-813-577-890-413; 074-017-562-218-104; 077-489-033-113-862; 078-289-929-152-661; 080-354-103-723-747; 082-391-920-356-292; 091-814-028-345-11X; 094-332-042-747-219; 098-605-034-406-998; 103-974-904-022-158; 104-898-249-163-45X; 112-502-745-192-029; 118-581-038-700-756; 131-852-428-639-615; 133-323-798-067-270; 134-702-076-457-337; 144-641-185-507-109; 156-119-548-171-717,14

Chassin; Sahand Behboodi; Curran Crawford; Ned Djilali,"ABSTRACT This paper collects and synthesizes the technical requirements, implementation, and validation methods for quasi-steady agent-based simulations of interconnection-scale models with particular attention to the integration of renewable generation and controllable loads. Approaches for modeling aggregated controllable loads are presented and placed in the same control and economic modeling framework as generation resources for interconnection planning studies. Model performance is examined with system parameters that are typical for an interconnection approximately the size of the Western Electricity Coordinating Council (WECC) and a control area about 1/100 the size of the system. These results are used to demonstrate and validate the methods presented.",1,4,422,435,Economic model; Interconnection; Engineering; Control area; Systems engineering; Electricity; Demand response; Renewable generation; Renewable integration; System parameters; Simulation,,,,Natural Resources Canada; U.S. Department of Energy,http://journal.hep.com.cn/eng/CN/10.15302/J-ENG-2015109 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809916300236 http://engineering.org.cn/EN/10.15302/J-ENG-2015109 http://journal.hep.com.cn/eng/CN/abstract/abstract14680.shtml https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2095809916300236 https://www.osti.gov/pages/biblio/1312043-agent-based-simulation-interconnection-scale-renewable-integration-demand-response-studies https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82205641.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.15302/j-eng-2015109,,10.15302/j-eng-2015109,2222913119,,0,003-822-723-869-992; 005-054-429-185-032; 011-860-356-701-57X; 011-964-416-713-369; 013-333-546-356-402; 027-814-324-515-733; 027-975-844-282-133; 031-927-526-853-496; 034-647-892-838-862; 040-122-308-543-906; 042-507-122-201-238; 043-364-966-475-66X; 053-712-723-705-572; 054-210-594-446-653; 054-675-246-444-424; 057-513-382-687-428; 059-702-016-794-595; 067-038-210-304-788; 076-279-991-252-645; 078-145-441-922-148; 078-733-073-587-489; 080-023-448-029-818; 086-086-108-082-483; 104-739-338-934-06X; 107-713-932-624-631; 108-358-781-737-059; 109-125-078-449-046; 110-829-231-312-902; 113-104-413-799-994; 113-582-535-669-625; 117-331-756-176-540; 118-260-558-302-535; 122-669-029-556-204; 130-829-962-830-768; 131-402-357-307-403; 132-857-249-252-078; 134-535-580-789-28X; 151-769-373-397-548; 159-797-244-275-068; 160-528-253-959-445; 168-679-555-321-315; 173-107-144-101-745; 177-383-221-786-263; 180-419-803-127-84X,9

Nirmala; G. Uthra,"Abstract Analytic Hierarchy process (AHP) is an effective approach for dealing with Multi Criteria Decision Problem (MCDM). This paper investigates AHP in Intuitionistic Fuzzy environment. Here comparative judgments are taken in the form of Triangular Intuitionistic fuzzy number (TIFN). The elements of the comparison matrices are transformed into Interval valued Intuitionistic Fuzzy number by using Nearest Weighted Intuitionistic Interval Approximation (NWIIA) which is introduced in this paper. Then, the transformed matrix is changed in to a crisp matrix by using score function. Priority values are calculated by Arithmetic mean method. This process is applied to the supplier selection problem from the paper in the literature with the same data. It is found that this method yields the same result as that of the paper more easily.",16,,987,993,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Interval approximation; Multi criteria decision; Intuitionistic fuzzy; Mathematics; Score; Analytic hierarchy process; Arithmetic mean,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214785319310326,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.matpr.2019.05.186,,10.1016/j.matpr.2019.05.186,2967851950,,0,009-881-393-198-900; 036-617-362-362-567; 047-221-051-574-632; 062-456-679-419-11X; 067-434-959-291-864,1

Both instruments showed that global workload was high and that it was greater in the context of Successive (absolute judgment) as compared to Simultaneous (comparative judgment) type tasks. In addition, the MRQ indicated that workload was greater when observers operated in a multi-task as compared to a single-task environment, a dimension to which the NASA-TLX was not sensitive. The MRQ added to diagnosticity in the workload picture by identifying information-processing resources utilized across experimental conditions and sets of resources that were condition specific, resources not encompassed by the NASA-TLX.

Wyer,"Consumers who compare products may often ignore features that the choice alternatives have in common. As a result, they often evaluate products more favorably when the products have unique positive features but common negative features than when they have unique negative features but common positive ones. Two studies examined contingencies in the occurrence of these “cancellation” effects and explored their implications for people's evaluations of not only the products being compared but other products they encounter subsequently. Some participants were explicitly told to compare two products at the time they received information about them. They not only disregarded the products' common features when initially evaluating these products, but disregarded evaluatively similar features of a third product they encountered some time later. Other participants were initially told to describe each product separately. In this condition, they formed an overall impression of each product individually, and so cancellation effects were not apparent. Nevertheless, their preference for one product over the other was based on a comparison of the products' individual features that they could recall at the time of judgment rather than on the global impressions they had formed when the product information was first presented.",12,4,327,340,Recall; Psychology; Social psychology,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1016/S1057-7408%2816%2930084-5 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1016/S1057-7408(16)30084-5 https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-47482 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1057740816300845,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1057-7408(16)30084-5,,10.1016/s1057-7408(16)30084-5,2039138072,,0,000-343-678-303-916; 001-444-401-468-83X; 003-014-620-687-461; 008-432-672-627-050; 012-298-260-310-196; 014-180-901-417-241; 015-334-468-316-778; 022-008-500-111-482; 024-601-513-596-079; 029-243-230-783-936; 038-144-452-181-052; 038-182-185-751-862; 041-087-249-246-834; 042-634-832-252-891; 047-880-172-839-43X; 050-397-057-022-908; 054-689-893-003-972; 060-671-593-636-825; 067-043-648-074-16X; 075-666-452-309-677; 077-604-423-905-284; 079-038-163-385-313; 081-867-474-239-006; 092-211-475-626-865; 110-055-879-281-073; 113-030-426-538-874; 127-422-583-091-94X; 130-642-365-964-821; 131-133-659-841-473; 141-022-843-692-421; 143-401-585-527-580; 175-259-911-124-039; 189-953-224-914-934,29

The impact of counting strategies on these configurations and their possible semantic status were investigated in young adults. Experiment 1 showed that young adults named numerical finger configurations faster when they conformed to their own canonical finger-counting habits than when they did not. Experiment 2 showed that numeral finger configurations used as unconsciously presented primes speeded up numerical comparative judgements of Arabic numeral targets. Participants responded faster and made fewer errors with numerical than with non-numerical primes, and when primes and targets were congruent (i.e., leading to the same response). Moreover, this priming effect generalised to novel never consciously seen numerosities for canonical configurations but not for non-canonical ones.

Plaisier; Wouter M. Bergmann Tiest; Astrid M. L. Kappers,"Visual judgment of small numerosities (<4) is generally assumed to be done through subitizing, which is a faster process than counting. Subitizing has also been shown to occur in haptic judgment of the number of spheres in the hand. Furthermore, interactions have been shown to exist between visually perceived numbers and hand motor action. In this study, we compare enumeration of a set of spheres presented to one hand (unimanual) and enumeration of the same total number of spheres presented divided over the two hands (bimanual). Our results show that, like in vision, a combination of subitizing and counting is used to process numbers in active touch. This shows that numbers are processed in a modality-independent way. This suggests that there are not only interactions between perception of numbers and hand motor action, but rather that number representation is modality-independent.",202,2,507,512,Haptic technology; Enumeration; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Haptic perception; Touch Perception; Number representation; Motor action; Computer science; Subitizing,,Analysis of Variance; Functional Laterality; Hand; Humans; Mathematical Concepts; Motor Activity; Reaction Time; Touch Perception,,,https://paperity.org/p/21362109/grabbing-subitizing-with-both-hands-bimanual-number-processing https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00221-009-2146-1 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20047090 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2849748 https://research.vu.nl/ws/files/2886979/258099.pdf http://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/42689 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/20047090 https://core.ac.uk/display/15472129 https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/grabbing-subitizing-with-both-hands-bimanual-number-processing https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F42689 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs00221-009-2146-1.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/15472129.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00221-009-2146-1,20047090,10.1007/s00221-009-2146-1,2148296897,PMC2849748,0,000-404-828-065-770; 012-627-787-071-501; 014-270-106-559-645; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-964-684-147-748; 021-583-075-575-028; 029-086-325-795-546; 031-521-631-886-53X; 032-229-108-136-564; 036-411-476-530-721; 049-569-298-896-158; 053-202-692-120-773; 061-442-332-939-059; 082-964-869-668-527; 083-969-766-555-246; 104-898-249-163-45X; 132-064-988-372-831; 144-756-840-408-650; 149-190-852-458-200; 164-046-578-199-011,17

One popular implementation of the method is based on solving an eigenvalue problem for the pairwise comparisons matrix. In such cases the ranking result for the principal eigenvector of the pairwise comparisons matrix is adopted, while the eigenvalue is used to determine the index of inconsistency. A lot of research has been devoted to the critical analysis of the eigenvalue based approach. One of them is the work of Bana e Costa and Vansnick (2008) . In their work, the authors define the conditions of order preservation (COP) and show that even for sufficiently consistent pairwise comparisons matrices, this condition cannot be met. The presented work defines more precise criteria for determining when the COP is met. To formulate the criteria, an error factor is used describing how far the input to the ranking procedure is from the ranking result. The relationship between the Saaty consistency index and COP is also discussed.",245,1,333,337,Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Pairwise comparison; Decision analysis; Ranking; Consistency index; Mathematics; Potentially all pairwise rankings of all possible alternatives; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013arXiv1312.2986K/abstract https://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2986 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1312.html#Kulakowski13b https://128.84.21.199/abs/1312.2986 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1312.2986 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2986 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1312.2986v3 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ejores:v:245:y:2015:i:1:p:333-337 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221715002039 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v245y2015i1p333-337.html http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221715002039 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.010 http://arxiv.org/abs/1312.2986,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.010,,10.1016/j.ejor.2015.03.010,1673111642,,0,006-292-024-020-432; 006-715-600-922-621; 009-743-097-643-728; 009-881-393-198-900; 018-162-101-670-747; 020-499-240-517-983; 024-902-814-451-868; 026-358-629-546-378; 027-686-672-596-900; 028-454-054-636-147; 030-614-604-627-790; 032-096-904-158-91X; 033-747-503-599-071; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-133-706-587-245; 036-417-983-943-026; 037-431-789-266-612; 037-581-610-717-836; 038-245-771-504-704; 038-523-104-433-065; 040-520-796-156-684; 047-108-373-485-451; 050-276-604-535-681; 051-525-616-582-208; 052-840-587-628-700; 054-244-923-299-670; 057-038-371-738-322; 059-398-101-157-562; 063-558-107-752-842; 067-143-980-711-210; 067-293-544-741-847; 071-166-407-222-576; 078-991-814-764-860; 090-134-173-730-262; 091-681-693-508-242; 103-039-236-899-255; 125-513-366-485-249; 142-718-762-497-001; 156-228-166-584-711; 164-064-718-436-744; 170-987-579-156-787,42

Human perception and performance,19391277; 00961523,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Ruben Ellinghaus; Rolf Ulrich; Karin M. Bausenhart,"In psychophysical experiments, participants are often asked to compare the magnitude of a constant standard against the magnitude of a variable comparison. According to prominent models of stimulus discrimination, discrimination sensitivity should depend only on the physical magnitude difference between these two stimuli but not on the order of their presentation. However, previous experiments on auditory duration discrimination have shown that discrimination sensitivity is higher when the standard precedes rather than follows the comparison. It is presently unclear whether this Type B effect emerges only for duration discrimination or generalizes across modalities and stimulus attributes. Therefore, we conducted a study in which participants performed several discrimination tasks for various stimulus attributes (i.e., duration, frequency, intensity, and numerosity), each in the visual and in the auditory modality. In all cases, discrimination sensitivity was higher when the standard preceded rather than followed the comparison. This result indicates that the Type B effect is not restricted to the domain of temporal cognition but rather reflects a general phenomenon across a range of domains and modalities. The outcome of the present experiment is consistent with the internal reference model according to which the Type B effect is a consequence of a dynamically updated internal reference, which is used in the comparison process. Alternatively, a weighted difference model with a larger weight for the second stimulus position than for the first stimulus position can also account for this result.

The theories underlying these three comparison processes each assume an upward comparison with a better-off standard to lead to lower self-concept and a downward comparison with a worse-off standard to result in higher self-concept, instead. However, there is a lack of studies investigating the joint effects of simultaneously activated social, temporal, and dimensional comparisons. To close this gap, two experimental studies and one field study were conducted. In Studies 1 (N = 80) and 2 (N = 80), participants were asked to infer the mathematical self-concept of fictitious students after receiving experimentally manipulated social, temporal, and dimensional information about the fictitious students’ achievement in mathematics. In Study 3 (N = 225), participants were asked to report their own mathematical self-concept after rating their mathematical achievement in comparison to social, temporal, and dimensional standards. In all three studies, similar main effects for each of the three comparisons were found leading to lower self-concept following upward comparisons and higher self-concept following downward comparisons.

063-035-497-134-974,A Scaling Research on Faculty Characteristics That Higher Education Students Prioritize,2014-03-01,2014,journal article,College student journal,01463934,,,Meltem Acar Güvendir,"In view of the importance of taking student preferences into account while establishing educational practices, this study explores which faculty member characteristic fourth year students mostly prefer in a higher education institution. A faculty member characteristics form that includes ten characteristics was administered to 419 fourth year teacher trainees. Data gathered was scaled from a complete data matrix with Thurstone's law of comparative judgment case V. equation. The findings of the study show that show that the faculty member characteristic that the students prioritized is ""having good interpersonal relations"". This characteristic is followed by ""occupational experience"", ""pedagogical knowledge"", ""support to social activities"", ""generosity in grading"", ""taste of humor"", ""status"", ""age"", ""physical appearance"", and ""gender"". As it generates an awareness of student preferences in relation to faculty member characteristics, the study is noteworthy for higher education faculty who are charged with teaching. Key Words: Pair-wise scaling, higher education, student preferences, faculty member characteristics Introduction University is the highest educational institution in a country. It can be defined as the universal resource of academic research that promotes the synthesis of different opinions and the distribution of scientific truth. It is a guild or corporation that serves in disseminating knowledge (Rothblatt 1997). According to Scott (1998 p. 127) ""the university at any rate has the potential to become the leading institution in the knowledge society as the primary location at which symbolic goods are, if not produced, at least conceived and designed."" It also serves as a territorial display of civilization-building with a bias towards advancing society-at-large through knowledge distribution. Moreover, it has been utilized in ways to control or contain social, political, and economic power relations (Arnove 2003). Korkut (1999) states that the primary missions of universities are to implement professional education-teaching and conduct scientific research. However, he considers the professional education-teaching mission more important than conducting scientific research since scientific research can also be conducted by institutions other than universities. In addition to these two missions, another significant purpose of universities is to create individuals with inquisitorial skills in order to respond to the expectations of society. Doganay and San (2004) argue that universities in a democratic society should train individuals in terms of active decision making, autonomy, and creative intellectuality so that they can refrain from devoting themselves imprudently to authorities. Similarly, Harvey and Green (1993) state that universities should help students to develop analytic and critical thinking skills. In order for universities to accomplish these goals it is necessary for them to have distinguished faculty members who provide education for students, commit themselves fully to their teaching obligations, engage in scholarly activities, act as role models, and inspire students for future goals. Therefore, faculty members form an important part of university education (Karakutuk et al. 2008). Research on faculty member characteristics has shown that occupational knowledge (Metzler and Woessmann 2010; Buchmann 1984; Shulman 1986), interpersonal relations (Fraser et al. 2010; Birch and Ladd 1998; Tartwijk et al. 1998), measurement and evaluation knowledge (Akgol 1994), pedagogical content knowledge (Van Driel and Berry 2012; Abell 2007), awareness of technological innovations (Carr et al. 1998; Mishra and Koehler 2003), and the personality of the university instructors (Cranton and King 2003; Renaud and Murray 1996) are related to students' academic achievement. In addition to these characteristics, another important point that needs to be considered in higher education is student preferences in relation to how a faculty member should be. …",48,1,173,183,Higher education; Grading (education); Sociology; Mathematics education; Pedagogy; Knowledge society; Academic achievement; Educational institution; Case method; Scientific method; Interpersonal relationship,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-372252080/a-scaling-research-on-faculty-characteristics-that https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1034185,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-372252080/a-scaling-research-on-faculty-characteristics-that,,,801424564,,0,,2

Reiff,"Once, when I was in China in 1982, I saw a group of hundreds of people— perhaps even thousands—on their knees armed with trowels paving a new multilane highway by hand. Of course, this task could have been done much more efficiently by machine, even in 1982, and presumably even more efficiently now, but such machines were not being used in China at the time, at least not on this project. No doubt this was because labor-intensive methods of construction provided advantages over the more modern capital-intensive methods available at the time. First, under the conditions then prevailing in China, labor-intensive methods were probably much cheaper, assuming that it is meaningful to make such comparative judgments with regard to costs in a centrally planned economy. Second, and for our purposes much more importantly, labor-intensive methods of construction kept people employed who otherwise would not be. For even if paving machines were made in China at the time (while I am sure they are now I doubt they were then) and thus some of those not employed building the highway could have been employed building the machines used to build the highway, there would have been a net loss in employment opportunities, or at least there was reason to be concerned this would be the case, and this made opt- ing for paving machines less attractive regardless of the relative cost. Otherwise, the only way to explain the Chinese decision to employ this labor-intensive method of construction rather than a more efficient capital intensive method is to think the Chinese neither had the money to purchase paving machines back in 1982 nor the resources and expertise required to build these machines themselves.",,,65,92,Capital intensity; Labour economics; Economics; Planned economy; China; Structural unemployment; European central bank; Relative cost; Full employment,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-137-55000-2_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-137-55000-2_4,,10.1007/978-1-137-55000-2_4,2428639090,,0,010-258-010-191-99X; 018-350-485-034-341; 030-361-584-613-793; 031-360-901-544-253; 043-411-166-522-076; 050-300-887-143-764; 052-939-954-168-495; 053-019-553-726-85X; 055-049-359-529-721; 057-563-176-804-940; 058-507-885-152-041; 068-322-385-830-32X; 072-144-849-064-084; 076-867-895-799-211; 081-683-703-494-961; 090-738-237-848-225; 091-834-250-076-289; 115-876-936-530-161; 118-477-792-061-159; 119-884-592-348-117; 129-981-967-709-124; 144-809-490-634-581; 154-499-588-522-15X; 157-045-974-164-699; 161-729-604-004-227; 175-859-394-366-636; 188-178-156-756-995,1

Thirty-three children participated in the study and were randomly assigned to two groups at primary school entry, matched for age, gender and IQ. All children went through the same curriculum except that the abacus group received a 2-hour/per week AMC training, while the control group did traditional numerical practice for a similar amount of time. After a two-year training, they were tested with a numerical Stroop task. Electroencephalographic (EEG) and event related potential (ERP) recording techniques were used to monitor the temporal dynamics during the task. Children were required to determine the numerical magnitude (NC task) or the physical size (PC task) of two numbers presented simultaneously. In the NC task, the AMC group showed faster response times but similar accuracy compared to the control group. In the PC task, the two groups exhibited the same speed and accuracy. The saliency of numerical information relative to physical information was greater in AMC group. With regards to ERP results, the AMC group displayed congruity effects both in the earlier (N1) and later (N2 and LPC (late positive component) time domain, while the control group only displayed congruity effects for LPC. In the left parietal region, LPC amplitudes were larger for the AMC than the control group. Individual differences for LPC amplitudes over left parietal area showed a positive correlation with RTs in the NC task in both congruent and neutral conditions. After controlling for the N2 amplitude, this correlation also became significant in the incongruent condition. Our results suggest that AMC training can strengthen the relationship between symbolic representation and numerical magnitude so that numerical information processing becomes quicker and automatic in AMC children.",9,,245,245,Correlation; Late positive component; Psychology; Stroop effect; Mental abacus; Mental calculation; Speech recognition; Electroencephalography; Event-related potential; Information processing,facilitation; interference; mental abacus; numerical processing; numerical stroop paradigm,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4436880 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00245/full https://core.ac.uk/display/43881087 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26042012 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00245/abstract https://philpapers.org/rec/YAONPE https://doaj.org/article/daf143c1d1da41d2b0c2de21e1258f60 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82864790.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00245,26042012,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00245,1553482262,PMC4436880,0,000-391-273-375-862; 000-722-089-564-018; 001-244-253-407-376; 001-744-582-232-088; 002-396-661-593-082; 002-641-654-624-887; 005-339-818-763-827; 008-373-567-331-285; 014-175-100-464-076; 015-042-600-836-494; 015-097-529-101-193; 017-035-527-353-329; 019-131-039-088-768; 019-320-823-727-386; 019-777-112-821-405; 021-899-860-380-120; 023-254-266-920-133; 023-382-334-364-287; 023-664-006-861-925; 024-265-305-316-415; 028-617-436-328-143; 028-935-791-502-971; 031-541-539-785-70X; 032-073-931-411-464; 032-635-789-049-979; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-196-916-967-344; 034-244-507-398-316; 037-193-186-309-336; 037-440-716-298-773; 038-836-693-377-803; 048-346-642-507-912; 048-801-315-665-878; 050-020-384-415-16X; 052-762-678-144-647; 052-768-591-438-420; 054-073-002-603-611; 057-877-558-474-926; 058-553-503-941-801; 061-266-607-128-096; 066-451-801-924-025; 066-895-056-843-643; 068-746-651-078-986; 074-056-138-033-479; 078-074-087-224-607; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-278-977-669-293; 088-849-249-876-733; 096-920-608-180-439; 103-107-253-561-602; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-416-952-540-406; 110-878-263-543-335; 116-093-617-267-98X; 117-894-335-079-370; 120-204-913-104-353; 127-342-481-250-639; 129-173-125-978-971; 149-595-316-187-991,17

Three comparisons were made: post VAM, post U-VBF and overall pre- and post-therapy. Twenty-two phonetically-trained listeners were asked to determine whether pre- or post-therapy recordings sounded ""closer to the English target"", using their own implicit phonological knowledge (prompted via orthographic representation). Results are compared with segment-oriented percent target consonant correct (PTCC) derived from phonetic transcriptions. Listener judgements and PTCC suggest that both children made improvements using both VAM and U-VBF. Statistical analysis showed listener agreement in each comparison, though agreement was weak. However, perceptual evaluation offers a straightforward method of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and can be used by phonetically trained or lay listeners.",30,3-5,398,415,Psychology; Transcription (linguistics); Perception; Biofeedback; Phonetic transcription; Consonant; Submucous cleft palate; Therapy outcome measure; Statistical analysis; Linguistics; Audiology,Cleft palate; perceptual speech evaluation; ultrasound; visual articulatory models,"Articulation Disorders/diagnostic imaging; Biofeedback, Psychology; Child; Cleft Palate/surgery; Humans; Language; Male; Phonetics; Speech; Ultrasonography",,Queen Margaret University,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477 https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/multiple-phonetically-trainedlistener-comparisons-of-speech-before-and-after-articulatory-intervention-in-two-children-with-repaired-submucous-cleft-palate(8886d2a4-9208-4b5a-bfb6-8b94ca93100f)/export.html https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/55416/ https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/4265/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901243 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/multiple-phonetically-trained-listener-comparisons-of-speech-befo http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26901243 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/141197462.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477,26901243,10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477,2253370600,,0,001-315-816-076-394; 008-041-809-197-613; 009-372-676-342-671; 009-824-423-512-470; 010-301-055-317-622; 015-020-190-202-212; 021-150-611-033-895; 023-468-392-535-299; 026-146-054-603-663; 028-581-083-911-20X; 030-714-304-671-982; 035-296-852-321-37X; 044-371-399-680-449; 062-979-943-769-948; 066-722-464-799-316; 071-784-526-493-369; 072-899-493-722-159; 075-150-794-733-673; 077-380-915-534-563; 079-548-160-949-785; 083-341-153-259-678; 083-399-008-517-10X; 098-817-322-661-277; 102-293-898-726-617; 106-577-959-156-073; 110-585-938-190-488; 115-973-306-873-842; 117-259-216-851-492; 117-316-780-007-872; 141-736-239-680-568; 143-480-868-939-209; 148-674-063-231-462; 156-602-657-780-001; 168-423-330-977-509,3

Handley; Jason S. Babcock; Jeff B. Pelz,"Image evaluation tasks are often conducted using paired comparisons or ranking. To elicit interval scales, both methods rely on Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment in which objects closer in psychological space are more often confused in preference comparisons by a putative discriminal random process. It is often debated whether paired comparisons and ranking yield the same interval scales. An experiment was conducted to assess scale production using paired comparisons and ranking. For this experiment a Pioneer Plasma Display and Apple Cinema Display were used for stimulus presentation. Observers performed rank order and paired comparisons tasks on both displays. For each of five scenes, six images were created by manipulating attributes such as lightness, chroma, and hue using six different settings. The intention was to simulate the variability from a set of digital cameras or scanners. Nineteen subjects, (5 females, 14 males) ranging from 19-51 years of age participated in this experiment. Using a paired comparison model and a ranking model, scales were estimated for each display and image combination yielding ten scale pairs, ostensibly measuring the same psychological scale. The Bradley-Terry model was used for the paired comparisons data and the Bradley-Terry-Mallows model was used for the ranking data. Each model was fit using maximum likelihood estimation and assessed using likelihood ratio tests. Approximate 95% confidence intervals were also constructed using likelihood ratios. Model fits for paired comparisons were satisfactory for all scales except those from two image/display pairs; the ranking model fit uniformly well on all data sets. Arguing from overlapping confidence intervals, we conclude that paired comparisons and ranking produce no conflicting decisions regarding ultimate ordering of treatment preferences, but paired comparisons yield greater precision at the expense of lack-of-fit.",5294,,211,221,Statistics; Hue; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Ranking; Interval Scale; Mathematics; Confidence interval; Data set; Likelihood-ratio test,,,,,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5294/1/Experimental-congruence-of-interval-scale-production-from-paired-comparisons-and/10.1117/12.526623.full https://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=836996 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Handley/publication/250306366_Experimental_congruence_of_interval_scale_production_from_paired_comparisons_and_ranking_for_image_evaluation/links/00b7d51e9c5d7d9897000000.pdf?disableCoverPage=true http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003SPIE.5294..211H/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.526623,,10.1117/12.526623,1997847709,,0,014-769-753-773-624; 035-160-701-094-760; 043-741-941-481-335; 088-185-235-230-617; 096-657-443-968-942; 112-758-372-441-254; 112-883-743-382-445; 117-352-939-718-472; 124-155-028-007-478; 125-506-752-898-572; 179-395-778-197-010,3

Question frame was manipulated in a comparative judgment task previously assumed to involve inference across a probabilistic mental model (e.g., “Which city is largest”—the “larger” question—vs. “Which city is smallest”—the “smaller” question). Participants identified either the largest or smallest city (Experiments 1a and 2) or the richest or poorest person (Experiment 1b) in a 3-alternative forced-choice (3-AFC) task (Experiment 1) or a 2-AFC task (Experiment 2). Response times revealed an interaction between question frame and the number of options recognized. When participants were asked the smaller question, response times were shorter when none of the options were recognized. The opposite pattern was found when participants were asked the larger question: response time was shorter when all options were recognized. These task–stimuli congruity results in judgment under uncertainty are consistent with, and predicted by, theories of magnitude comparison, which make use of deductive inferences from declarative knowledge.",41,1,42,54,Heuristics; Descriptive knowledge; Psychology; Psychological testing; Cognitive psychology; Inference; Mental model; Probabilistic logic; Social psychology; Decision tree,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cues; Decision Trees; Female; Humans; Judgment; Knowledge; Male; Middle Aged; Probability; Psychological Tests; Reaction Time; Recognition, Psychology; Uncertainty; Young Adult",,Economic and Social Research Council; Leverhulme Trust Grant,http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/36944/8/42.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/42148842 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4296670 https://www.scienceopen.com/document?vid=8cd8c0e4-161b-454f-a3c9-5135ace862f7 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4296670 http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0037411 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1049857 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/36944/ http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0037411,25068857,10.1037/a0037411,2003143154,PMC4296670,0,000-296-044-768-210; 003-663-261-936-867; 004-024-541-414-25X; 004-197-041-167-112; 006-240-462-825-885; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 008-484-658-695-107; 009-188-129-583-580; 010-432-476-671-646; 011-060-968-966-450; 013-621-028-229-557; 019-313-788-423-049; 021-497-231-157-792; 022-969-696-252-262; 025-206-322-285-127; 025-971-418-331-624; 027-262-763-905-749; 027-564-285-840-47X; 035-061-927-263-746; 037-535-523-738-551; 037-619-250-554-164; 037-743-862-202-918; 040-920-933-999-411; 041-659-281-349-623; 043-873-483-006-805; 044-729-100-505-384; 046-171-638-427-624; 046-296-893-639-842; 047-949-982-406-946; 048-451-961-710-445; 049-230-710-101-888; 049-863-149-640-914; 050-050-769-884-407; 052-357-181-468-17X; 054-577-250-506-991; 058-571-827-675-115; 059-283-972-289-253; 060-006-488-340-897; 060-493-015-131-893; 061-556-739-571-730; 075-455-983-689-584; 076-538-809-196-696; 077-955-155-009-954; 078-517-923-951-675; 078-531-917-031-005; 080-184-747-285-616; 107-992-231-036-532; 111-291-448-643-846; 113-067-244-251-003; 127-540-797-369-844; 128-909-793-351-309; 146-455-178-307-380; 160-177-199-855-976; 171-420-409-975-770; 176-017-510-665-867; 180-662-663-208-559,1

Countries around the world create different ways in order to give a satisfactory answer to the new reality of massed conflicts. Stand out mechanisms such as class actions in the United States and Canada, the Group Litigation Order in England and Musterver- fahren in Germany, as well as a practical methodology adopted by the European Court of Human Rights.

Fuentes,"Previous studies have suggested that numerical processing relates to mathematical performance, but it seems that such relationship is more evident for intentional than for automatic numerical processing. In the present study we assessed the relationship between the two types of numerical processing and specific mathematical abilities in a sample of 109 children in grades 1 to 6. Participants were tested in an ample range of mathematical tests and also performed both a numerical and a size comparison task. The results showed that numerical processing related to mathematical performance only when inhibitory control was involved in the comparison tasks. Concretely, we found that intentional numerical processing, as indexed by the numerical distance effect in the numerical comparison task, was related to mathematical reasoning skills only when the task-irrelevant dimension (the physical size) was incongruent; whereas automatic numerical processing, indexed by the congruency effect in the size comparison task, was related to mathematical calculation skills only when digits were separated by small distance. The observed double dissociation highlights the relevance of both intentional and automatic numerical processing in mathematical skills, but when inhibitory control is also involved.",6,,375,375,Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Inhibitory control; Mathematical reasoning; Mathematical performance; Mathematical ability; Distance effect; Mathematical skill; Computer science; Dissociation (neuropsychology),congruency effect; inhibitory control; mathematical abilities; numerical comparison task; numerical distance effect; primary school children; size comparison task,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00375/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4379738/ https://webs.um.es/lfuentes/miwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?id=publicaciones&cache=cache&media=fp_ep_pina_et_al_2015.pdf https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/518520 http://www.frontiersin.org/Educational_Psychology/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00375/abstract https://philpapers.org/rec/PINIAA-2 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00375/full https://core.ac.uk/display/43819504 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4379738 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/518520 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82845114.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00375,25873909,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00375,2015191501,PMC4379738,0,000-490-713-895-241; 001-244-253-407-376; 003-146-829-638-518; 003-756-834-371-246; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-720-683-958-49X; 008-969-825-870-669; 014-025-071-070-962; 014-157-185-757-337; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-237-442-789-759; 015-247-547-369-258; 015-364-125-273-638; 015-456-782-384-125; 016-063-401-062-35X; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-693-197-814-536; 018-169-036-496-712; 019-777-112-821-405; 021-360-373-615-026; 021-671-283-817-095; 021-899-860-380-120; 022-192-938-846-259; 025-273-714-276-887; 028-908-173-804-813; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-842-221-342-270; 037-054-632-717-760; 037-219-938-919-894; 037-256-617-621-627; 039-555-369-773-746; 041-221-727-025-564; 042-108-554-770-743; 042-197-148-666-50X; 045-735-184-813-268; 046-313-665-115-379; 047-792-799-354-639; 047-945-434-818-976; 051-839-955-755-136; 052-423-186-297-165; 055-026-521-300-430; 056-118-267-761-323; 057-039-704-422-559; 060-748-407-187-900; 063-863-517-456-537; 063-877-304-445-241; 065-309-058-996-650; 066-089-489-617-442; 067-574-583-962-053; 072-498-913-090-42X; 074-441-357-197-861; 077-199-101-572-900; 085-541-092-334-417; 086-922-926-484-143; 087-690-759-722-955; 088-296-478-377-383; 088-849-249-876-733; 092-156-959-027-886; 092-684-862-177-158; 096-920-608-180-439; 099-086-207-169-703; 100-496-419-979-500; 100-747-733-362-713; 110-878-263-543-335; 116-953-283-915-381; 122-195-468-484-095; 160-243-638-226-569; 173-322-641-061-213; 179-495-082-234-598; 187-124-320-457-103; 191-828-530-309-328; 194-903-265-762-557,16

Fink,"While some researchers propose the existence of a special numerosity sense, others challenge this view and argue that numerosity is derived from low-level features as density information. Here, we used size adaptation to manipulate the apparent area size of an object set without changing its physical density. After size adaptation, two probe patches were shown, each of which contained a specific numerosity of dots. Subjects were required to report, which probe patch contained more dots. Numerosity perception was compared between conditions where probe patches were adapted to appear smaller or larger. Size adaptation affected numerosity perception in a logarithmic fashion, increasing with the numerosity in the probe patch. No changes in density perception were found after size adaptation. Data suggest that size and density information play only a minor role in the estimation of low numerosities. In stark contrast, high numerosities strongly depend on size and density information. The data reinforce recent claims of separate mechanism for the perception of low and high numerosities.",6,1,32810,,Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Physical density; Mathematics,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/79491304 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27650296 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016NatSR...632810Z/abstract https://www.nature.com/articles/srep32810 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/79491304.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/srep32810,27650296,10.1038/srep32810,2521702236,PMC5030660,0,000-391-273-375-862; 002-743-317-587-306; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-797-468-767-542; 006-990-774-660-71X; 014-528-646-212-015; 018-224-534-275-858; 019-640-192-172-363; 023-550-184-898-290; 024-311-244-236-511; 042-366-406-891-692; 044-295-738-750-420; 048-140-321-419-731; 052-356-812-890-744; 055-946-027-823-561; 080-858-924-947-675; 092-491-995-641-38X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 106-936-931-089-579; 134-987-147-316-42X; 148-109-547-289-212,16

Summerville,"Triple Bottom Line (TBL) reports, outlining the economic, environmental and social impact of organisations, are increasingly viewed as a business requirement. Unfortunately, despite global frameworks, there is no one established standard against which to evaluate the social dimension. Thus, current social reporting is often disparagingly described as a public relations exercise with limited accountability, consistency or comparability. This article outlines the development of a generic TBL social impact framework and questionnaire designed to quantify an organisation's social impact. Based on valid preexisting measures appropriate for organisations in the industrialised world, the proposed framework and questionnaire offers a comparable and objective social impact assessment tool for organisations. The aim is to prompt informed debate and discussion about current organisational social impact reporting, whilst providing organisations with a tool which enables the identification, quantification and comparability of social impact reporting.",3,3,223,237,Impact assessment; Corporate social responsibility; Business; Environmental impact assessment; Economic impact analysis; Accountability; Social impact assessment; Sustainability reporting; Public relations; Triple bottom line,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijbget/v3y2007i3p223-237.html http://www.inderscience.com/link.php?id=14314 https://philpapers.org/rec/MILQTS https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJBGE.2007.014314 https://eprints.qut.edu.au/12350/ https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:776894a https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10881850.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijbge.2007.014314,,10.1504/ijbge.2007.014314,3018140729,,0,,16

Likert scales), items can be presented in a comparative fashion, so that respondents are asked to rank the items within blocks (forced-choice format). However, classical scoring procedures for these forced-choice designs lead to ipsative data, which presents psychometric challenges that are well described in the literature. Recently, Brown and Maydeu-Olivares (Educational and Psychological Measurement 71: 460–502, 2011a) introduced a model based on Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment, which overcomes the problems of ipsative data. Here, we provide a step-by-step tutorial for coding forced-choice responses, specifying a Thurstonian item response theory model that is appropriate for the design used, assessing the model’s fit, and scoring individuals on psychological attributes. Estimation and scoring is performed using Mplus, and a very straightforward Excel macro is provided that writes full Mplus input files for any forced-choice design.

However, Temple and Posner (1998) used ERPs and the numerical distance task with 5-year-olds to show that the development of numerical representations is difficult to disentangle from the development of the executive components of response organization and execution. Here we use the numerical Stroop paradigm (NSP) and ERPs to study possible executive interference in numerical processing tasks in 6–8-year-old children. In the NSP, the numerical magnitude of the digits is task-relevant and the physical size of the digits is task-irrelevant. We show that younger children are highly susceptible to interference from irrelevant physical information such as digit size, but that access to the numerical representation is almost as fast in young children as in adults. We argue that the developmental trajectories for executive function and numerical processing may act together to determine numerical development in young children.",21,6,662,671,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Executive functions; Physical information; Stroop Paradigm; Numeracy; Event-related potential; Diagnostic test,,,,Medical Research Council,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/39900/ https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/375340/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608010001238 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ945132 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608010001238 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10902450.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.004,,10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.004,1999541205,,0,000-165-094-703-589; 001-244-253-407-376; 004-121-572-754-93X; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-688-443-167-296; 008-059-893-696-890; 009-420-844-660-497; 009-691-999-497-895; 010-399-174-723-779; 011-247-436-249-24X; 013-621-298-749-675; 015-012-693-948-294; 017-035-527-353-329; 019-777-112-821-405; 024-265-305-316-415; 026-192-606-495-566; 030-242-387-577-541; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-809-037-593-864; 035-402-974-768-248; 036-403-728-589-122; 037-819-011-672-40X; 038-395-026-012-885; 038-406-658-229-135; 040-939-699-593-009; 042-108-554-770-743; 043-059-717-074-397; 043-288-458-558-686; 045-735-184-813-268; 048-935-524-968-684; 049-303-487-116-044; 052-522-619-080-29X; 057-349-983-849-38X; 064-672-833-839-016; 064-840-750-332-99X; 066-089-489-617-442; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-033-829-394-657; 072-849-353-462-759; 073-421-541-399-194; 074-225-283-011-852; 086-922-926-484-143; 087-709-692-997-280; 088-849-249-876-733; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-578-007-780-619; 093-171-874-765-291; 095-781-921-173-549; 104-898-249-163-45X; 110-878-263-543-335; 116-093-617-267-98X; 120-204-913-104-353; 121-989-153-587-995; 129-827-356-327-594; 145-140-986-126-382; 148-214-528-359-814; 152-406-182-124-102; 168-995-538-712-95X; 172-354-053-239-150; 194-903-265-762-557,18
065-404-733-751-848,"There Will Be Sharing: Population Biobanks, the Duty to Inform and the Limitations of the Individualistic Conception of Autonomy",,2014,journal article,Health law journal,11928336,,,Ma'n H. Zawati,"""'Data! Data! Data!' he cried impatiently. 'I can't make bricks without clay.'"" --Sherlock Holmes (in Arthur Conan Doyle, The Adventure of the Copper Beeches) INTRODUCTION The principle of autonomy has been the cornerstone of the physician's duty to inform ever since paternalistic practices receded in the second half of the 20th century. (1) In the past, physicians were authorized to withhold relevant information in an effort to protect their patients from harm. (2) With the advent of comparative judgment, however, physicians were encouraged to consider whether ""withholding [...] information [would] result in less harm on balance than divulging it"". (3) Eventually, disclosure became a central feature of the principle of autonomy. Practically speaking, the principle of autonomy in the medical field translated to the right (of a patient) to make an informed decision free from unjustified interference by others. (4) According to one conception, to respect autonomy is: ""[...] to give weight to autonomous persons' considered opinions and choices while refraining from obstructing their actions unless they are clearly detrimental to others. To show lack of respect for an autonomous agent is to repudiate that person's considered judgments, to deny an individual the freedom to act on those considered judgments, or to withhold information necessary to make a considered judgment, when there are no compelling reasons to do so"". (5) Based on this principle, the less an individual is expected to benefit therapeutically from a procedure, the higher the duty to inform becomes. This is true for cosmetic surgery, organ donation and non-therapeutic research. (6) In research, Canadian courts have maintained that participants are entitled to a ""full and frank disclosure"" (7) and that researchers' duties in that regard are as great, if not greater, than the duties owed by physicians in the clinical setting. (8) The increasingly longitudinal and international nature of research is challenging the feasibility of maintaining such an expansive duty to inform. (9) As researchers rely less on active human participation, and more on cutting-edge technologies that generate vast amounts of data, (10) the parameters of the traditional duty to inform look increasingly porous. This is particularly true for population biobanks, which aim to study data and samples collected on a large population scale and over a long period of time. (11) In these large-scale projects, participants are informed that their data and samples will be used to establish biobanks as resources for future research in health and genomics. (12) It is very difficult to provide full disclosure in the context of a biorepository for future, unspecified research by as-yet unnamed researchers. Much ink has been spilled in the last decade on the type of consent required for these population projects. Indeed, many have debated whether or not broad consent--a model increasingly used by population studies satisfies the legal requirements of informed consent. (13) Others have focused on operational matters, examining the governance and practicability of both specific and broad consent approaches to population biobanks. (14) In contrast, this article delves deeper into the reasons why many population biobanks have resorted to broad consent and why the current legal duty to inform requirements might be inimical to such projects (in particular) and research (in general). As will be detailed later in this text, population biobanks are limited in terms of what information they can provide to research participants during the consent process. On the one hand, they are increasingly encouraged to share their findings by providing access to their repositories, but on the other hand, they are unable to provide participants with full disclosure about the future use of their data and samples at the time of recruitment. …",21,,97,,Full disclosure; Biobank; Psychology; Paternalism; Duty; Population; Organ donation; Public relations; Autonomy; Informed consent,,,,,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-382949950/there-will-be-sharing-population-biobanks-the-duty,https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1G1-382949950/there-will-be-sharing-population-biobanks-the-duty,,,3124556017,,0,,2

Some steps and principles of AHP, such as the complexity of hierarchical decomposition, comparative judgments, priorities synthesis, and sensitivity analysis show, themselves to be utilities for the success of the technical evaluation process, going from meeting the hospital’s necessity for transparency to auditable process documentation. The hospital’s management’s expectation of separating the hospital’s medical technical evaluation process from the commercial evaluation process was achieved through the application of AHP. Despite the great number of possible variables for the ultra-sound’s technical evaluation, the decision-making team adapted itself easily and quickly to the employed method, contributing to the success of the work. The range of medical equipment installed in Brazil presents geographic concentration, with a large percentage of the equipment remaining unused due to lack of maintenance or inadequate staff to operate them, and the quantity of determined image devices per habitant above the average of other developed countries. That reality leads to the waste of resources in the health sector and adverse effects to the population’s health. This confirms the pertinence of the instrument’s application in this work, and indicates the potential increase in its utilization in the planning and control of public and private resources in the health sector. http://dx.doi.org/10.13033/ijahp.v2i1.70",2,1,,,Operations management; Population; Multiple criteria; Health sector; Hierarchical decomposition; Computer science; Medical equipment; Documentation; Transparency (graphic); Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.ijahp.org/index.php/IJAHP/article/view/70,http://dx.doi.org/10.13033/ijahp.v2i1.70,,10.13033/ijahp.v2i1.70,1740605680,,0,,7

According to influential models (e.g., J. Tzelgov, J. Meyer, & A. Henik, 1992), these effects are characterized by genuine asymmetries of size and number processing not accounted for by simple relative speed considerations, whereas some recent work (e.g., A. Pansky & D. Algom, 1999) partly challenges this view. This article presents 2 qualitative gradient-based predictions made by relative speed models and a diffusion-based implementation of the relative speed view to quantitatively account for response times and error rates in comparative judgments of digits. The results of 2 experiments using a completely task-symmetric design are in accord with these detailed predictions; they are also consistent with the view that both number and size are converted into magnitude representations of similar structure.",29,3,507,522,Psychology; Interference (wave propagation); Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Numeral system; Perception; Relative velocity; Magnitude (mathematics); Social psychology,,"Adolescent; Adult; Cognition; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematics; Models, Biological; Random Allocation; Reaction Time; Time Factors",,,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0096-1523.29.3.507 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/63702 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2003-05350-002 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Arepository.ubn.ru.nl%3A2066%2F63702 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12848323 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/12848323 https://publishup.uni-potsdam.de/opus4-ubp/frontdoor/index/index/docId/16591,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0096-1523.29.3.507,12848323,10.1037/0096-1523.29.3.507,2062975839,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 001-244-253-407-376; 005-069-733-811-554; 006-335-327-688-066; 007-043-293-875-817; 010-671-741-618-394; 015-012-693-948-294; 018-586-450-344-690; 019-777-112-821-405; 022-581-148-541-046; 023-540-148-927-518; 024-265-305-316-415; 026-057-364-619-471; 028-609-198-200-186; 029-528-044-487-606; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-859-577-484-389; 031-541-539-785-70X; 033-591-124-833-00X; 033-843-519-722-206; 043-288-458-558-686; 044-174-445-877-224; 046-562-347-684-506; 047-949-982-406-946; 048-346-642-507-912; 051-472-129-782-759; 060-290-302-293-721; 061-266-607-128-096; 061-934-855-450-018; 065-997-105-460-915; 069-459-700-412-050; 070-768-769-552-443; 081-040-212-508-522; 083-665-507-689-714; 085-135-618-123-734; 088-849-249-876-733; 098-420-272-837-936; 103-665-026-859-667; 104-901-364-255-979; 107-217-086-569-449; 108-164-445-874-825; 109-899-292-094-572; 117-172-224-687-037; 129-827-356-327-594; 129-851-969-304-440; 136-636-170-262-798; 162-948-788-312-369; 168-402-283-850-544; 177-015-691-281-199,140

Larimer,"Monitor characterization has taken on new importance for non-professional users, who are not usually equipped to make photometric measurements. Our purpose was to examine some of the visual judgments used in characterization schemes that have been proposed for web users. We studied adjusting brightness to set the black level, banding effects due to digitization, and gamma estimation in the light and in the dark, and a color-matching task in the light, on a desktop CRT and a laptop LCD. Observers demonstrated the sensitivity of the visual system for comparative judgments in black-level adjustment, banding visibility, and gamma estimation. The results of the color-matching task were ambiguous. In the brightness adjustment task, the action of the adjustment was not as presumed; however, perceptual judgments were as expected under the actual conditions. When the gamma estimates of observers were compared to photometric measurements, problems with the definition of gamma were identified. Information about absolute light levels that would be important for characterizing a display, given the shortcomings of gamma in measuring apparent contrast, are not measurable by eye alone. The LCD was not studied as extensively as the CRT because of viewing-angle problems, and its transfer function did not follow a power law, rendering gamma estimation meaningless.",4299,,439,454,Visibility; Brightness; Artificial intelligence; Display device; Visual perception; Rendering (computer graphics); Brightness discrimination; Computer vision; Computer science; Black level; Luminance,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hvei/hvei2001.html#GilleL01 https://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=903789 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/223190 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20030066239.pdf https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/4299/1/Using-the-human-eye-to-characterize-displays/10.1117/12.429514.full http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2001SPIE.4299..439G/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.429514,,10.1117/12.429514,2018584490,,0,010-695-746-876-903; 027-091-618-753-810; 064-681-586-377-540; 073-213-872-717-429; 087-441-797-450-391; 159-634-839-052-449; 167-299-039-876-663; 178-207-166-509-012,2

While this instrument has generally robust psychometric properties, the ability of its subscales to precisely discriminate between trait levels and the functioning of individual items, have not been rigorously investigated. We subjected the responses of 287 participants to Rasch analysis and found that the Rasch model fits KIMS subscales after minor modifications that involved rescoring one item, removing misfitting items, and combining locally dependent items into subtests.

The prevalence of overweight perceptions and their impact on well-being may have increased over the past decade due to an increase in the salience of weight-related issues. This study examines trends (2002–2014) in the prevalence of adolescent overweight perceptions and their association with psychosomatic complaints. Methods Data from 15-year-old adolescents were obtained between 2002 and 2014 in four rounds of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study in 33 countries in Europe and North America (N = 187,511). Design-adjusted logistic regressions were used to quantify changes in overweight perceptions over time. Linear modeling was used to assess change in the association between perceived overweight and self-reported psychosomatic complaint burden, adjusting for overweight status. Results Among boys, 10 of 33 countries saw an increase in overweight perceptions between 2002 and 2014, with Russia, Estonia, and Latvia showing the most pronounced year-on-year increases. Only England, France, Germany, and Norway saw an increase in the positive association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints among boys. Among girls, most countries (28/33) saw no change in the prevalence of overweight perceptions, with the prevalence over 40% in most nations. However, in 12 countries, the association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints increased among girls, with particularly strong changes seen in Scotland and Norway. Conclusions Evidence is presented which suggests that for adolescent girls in 12 Northern and Western European countries and for boys in four perceiving oneself as overweight may be increasingly deleterious for psychosomatic health.",60,2,204,211,Psychiatry; Demography; Logistic regression; Salience (language); Perception; Overweight; Complaint; Mental well-being; Health behaviour; Medicine; Correlation and dependence,Adolescents; Body image; Body size perception; Mental well-being; Overweight; Perceived body fatness; Psychosomatic symptoms,Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior/psychology; Adolescent Health; Body Image/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe/epidemiology; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; North America/epidemiology; Overweight/epidemiology; Self Concept; Sex Factors,,,https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/123456789/56155/1/whiteheadetalmanuscript260916.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/147247220 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27939879 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27939879 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X16303780 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27939879/ https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/12191 https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/56155 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132612344.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.09.029,27939879,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.09.029,2558635644,,0,004-956-709-973-726; 005-283-400-848-727; 006-531-793-871-982; 007-683-648-588-688; 014-120-935-529-757; 014-188-760-227-255; 016-894-045-443-320; 021-008-970-034-876; 022-888-291-928-16X; 026-178-964-289-200; 026-424-163-697-168; 035-963-227-404-301; 038-238-447-508-150; 041-121-551-800-038; 041-485-192-465-713; 045-271-657-674-972; 048-060-349-109-217; 049-780-348-981-451; 053-389-790-786-74X; 060-850-280-125-26X; 062-672-021-641-554; 064-044-170-767-367; 065-866-100-042-589; 069-947-348-345-17X; 071-787-648-351-987; 073-495-388-262-942; 084-520-720-549-349; 088-710-565-435-28X; 095-378-571-087-439; 099-372-559-522-547; 099-683-841-431-380; 103-863-104-258-814; 110-730-627-990-734; 138-344-096-837-810; 143-721-805-057-684; 146-852-560-340-64X; 163-574-135-245-237; 191-135-968-702-288,15

Methodological differences imply, however, that corresponding data do not necessarily reflect equivalent processes. Specifically, the DL procedure grants knowledge about trial-specific time demands and requires responses before a prespecified period has elapsed. In contrast, RS intervals often vary unpredictably between trials, and responses must be given after an explicit signal. Here, we investigated the effects of these differences in a flanker task. While all conditions yielded robust SAT functions, a right-shift of the curves pointed to reduced performance in RS conditions (Experiment 1, blocked; Experiments 2 and 3, randomized), as compared with DL conditions (Experiments 1–3, blocked), indicating that the detection of the RS imposes additional task demands. Moreover, the flanker effect vanished at long intervals in RS settings, suggesting that stimulus-related effects are absorbed in a slack when decisions are completed prior to the signal. In turn, effects of a flat (Experiment 2) versus a performance-contingent payment (Experiment 3) indicated that susceptibility to response strategies is higher in the DL than in the RS method. Finally, the RS procedure led to a broad range of slow responses and high accuracies, whereas DL conditions resulted in smaller variations in the upper data range (Experiments 1 and 2); with performance-contingent payment (Experiment 3), though, data ranges became similar. Together, the results uncover characteristic procedure-related effects and should help in selection of the appropriate technique.",45,3,702,717,Statistics; Trade-off; RSS; Flanker effect; Speed accuracy; Computer science,,Adult; Decision Making/physiology; Feedback; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Reaction Time/physiology; Young Adult,,,https://paperity.org/p/19101933/investigating-the-speed-accuracy-trade-off-better-use-deadlines-or-response-signals https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/21217 http://openscience.uni-leipzig.de/index.php/mr2/article/view/104 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0303-0 http://openscience.uni-leipzig.de/index.php/mr2/article/download/104/91 https://core.ac.uk/display/42021520 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23299396 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13428-012-0303-0 https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/21217/Dambacher_212179.pdf;sequence=2 http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0303-0.,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13428-012-0303-0,23299396,10.3758/s13428-012-0303-0,2075816949,,0,000-436-892-157-49X; 000-602-477-949-01X; 009-123-959-783-787; 009-896-351-192-799; 010-451-104-746-233; 011-267-417-883-438; 016-305-117-891-280; 017-886-033-305-509; 020-090-033-537-881; 020-870-313-913-754; 021-868-352-728-176; 022-513-574-133-227; 026-094-806-143-988; 027-815-377-376-751; 030-849-957-127-616; 031-080-720-277-356; 031-208-468-923-271; 032-905-474-283-59X; 035-764-593-157-53X; 036-202-034-834-882; 036-372-499-707-201; 039-976-839-489-99X; 040-229-642-058-121; 040-561-078-813-61X; 041-127-826-815-763; 041-670-949-756-948; 043-075-111-374-803; 045-737-612-314-211; 046-166-962-270-407; 049-885-085-369-949; 050-531-766-142-421; 050-948-703-592-234; 054-448-652-727-77X; 061-214-352-934-509; 061-522-471-151-43X; 076-516-500-452-797; 076-789-172-721-292; 079-801-836-939-701; 085-539-592-965-538; 086-681-295-651-253; 087-043-566-973-386; 094-470-209-990-372; 098-095-755-048-249; 106-704-471-961-799; 114-251-883-659-335; 132-100-364-569-455; 150-325-162-873-23X; 158-069-224-266-349; 198-746-314-370-12X,10

In this paper, we propose a method to create a meta-ranking using heterogeneous journal rankings. Employing a parametric model for paired comparison data we estimate quality scores for 58 journals in the OR/MS/POM community, which together with a shrinkage procedure allows for the identification of clusters of journals with similar quality.

These aspects are however neglected in most examinations of mathematics and, consequentially, in classroom teaching. One barrier to the inclusion of mathematical problem solving in assessment is that the skills involved are difficult to define and assess objectively. We present two studies that test a method called comparative judgement (CJ) that might be well suited to assessing mathematical problem solving. CJ is an alternative to traditional scoring that is based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than item-by-item scoring schemes.

In developing an objective test method, subjective evaluation data should be on a linear scale. According to Thurstone’s theory of comparative judgment, a%-preference from a paired-comparison test can be converted to a linear-scale value. The required number (N) of paired-comparison tests increases dramatically as the number of products increases. This problem should be solved by classifying the total products into several subgroups consisting of 3–4 products in each group. By doing so, it can not only significantly reduce the number of required paired-comparison tests, but it can also obtain more reliable, reproducible data.",48,1,19,26,Statistics; Round robin test; Thurstone scale; Linear scale; Evaluation data; Paired comparison; Evaluation methods; Mathematics; Standard normal deviate; Objective test,,,,,http://www.koreascience.or.kr/article/ArticleFullRecord.jsp?cn=PPJOBT_2016_v48n1_19,http://dx.doi.org/10.7584/ktappi.2016.48.1.019,,10.7584/ktappi.2016.48.1.019,2317660035,,0,029-235-347-855-833; 035-776-610-863-582,1

The relationship between the local estimation error, understood as the average absolute error \(E(c)\) over all direct estimates for the concept \(c\in C_{U}\) and the pairwise comparisons matrix inconsistency index is shown.

Here we determined whether threshold reduction is due to signal enhancement or to decreased signal response variability (internal noise), using a recently developed analysis for a Signal Detection Theory (SDT)-based contrast-identification paradigm (Katkov, Tsodyks, & Sagi, 2007a). We found that flankers did not affect internal noise, but instead caused increased target response when collinear with it, in agreement with the lateral facilitation effect.

Dette; Andrea E. Abele; Oliver Renner,"The conceptualisation and definition of vocational success is equivocal. The present paper attempts to clarify the construct. We suggest a model that distinguishes vocational success with respect to three parameters: 1) the criterion to be assessed with the extremes of specific work and task vs. global career, 2) the data content with the distinction of external records, comparative judgements and satisfaction ratings, and 3) the data source, i.e., documents and ratings by others (both external measures) and self-report data (internal measures). We then take a closer look at career success and give an overview of current operationalizations with respect to data source and data content. Subsequently, we report findings of a meta- analysis on the relationship between external measures and internal measures of career success. The analysis yields an estimated population correlation of ρest = .28, which is homogeneous for the correlation of external measures and career satisfaction (ρest = .30), but not for external measures and self-rated career success.

In contrast to conventional approaches that require the absolute reward of the chosen strategy to be quantifiable and observable, our setting assumes only that (noisy) binary feedback about the relative reward of two chosen strategies is available. This type of relative feedback is particularly appropriate in applications where absolute rewards have no natural scale or are difficult to measure (e.g., user-perceived quality of a set of retrieval results, taste of food, product attractiveness), but where pairwise comparisons are easy to make. We propose a novel regret formulation in this setting, as well as present an algorithm that achieves information-theoretically optimal regret bounds (up to a constant factor).",78,5,1538,1556,Machine learning; Mathematical optimization; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Preference elicitation; Online learning; Binary feedback; Constant factor; Attractiveness; Observable; Mathematics; Regret,,,,,http://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~colt2009/papers/006.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022000012000281 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.028 http://www.yisongyue.com/publications/jcss2012_dueling_bandit.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/82493780 https://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/tj/publications/yue_etal_09a.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jcss/jcss78.html#YueBKJ12 https://www.cs.mcgill.ca/~colt2009/papers/006.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82493780.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.028,,10.1016/j.jcss.2011.12.028,2044493620,,1,000-047-878-017-467; 000-685-849-415-665; 002-363-627-489-125; 005-143-267-200-686; 006-910-532-705-062; 010-378-869-267-615; 011-249-146-032-981; 014-703-690-282-366; 015-619-565-749-873; 016-104-565-430-858; 026-360-646-170-942; 031-071-902-139-03X; 033-725-148-057-018; 034-360-710-321-734; 036-912-425-600-73X; 045-247-663-505-681; 047-470-711-914-450; 061-994-855-950-025; 068-185-102-738-50X; 076-055-639-195-634; 081-035-629-728-09X; 086-097-975-690-974; 091-194-924-024-176; 091-299-050-457-00X; 094-086-462-600-570; 095-198-991-592-521; 114-409-184-113-285; 120-248-400-083-221; 155-526-393-205-485; 157-873-969-797-794; 165-340-931-790-691; 168-788-495-210-658,136
067-860-359-894-241,ICML - A Statistical Convergence Perspective of Algorithms for Rank Aggregation from Pairwise Data,2014-06-21,2014,conference proceedings,,,,,Arun Rajkumar; Shivani Agarwal,"There has been much interest recently in the problem of rank aggregation from pairwise data. A natural question that arises is: under what sorts of statistical assumptions do various rank aggregation algorithms converge to an 'optimal' ranking? In this paper, we consider this question in a natural setting where pairwise comparisons are drawn randomly and independently from some underlying probability distribution. We first show that, under a 'time-reversibility' or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) condition on the distribution, the rank centrality (PageRank) and least squares (HodgeRank) algorithms both converge to an optimal ranking. Next, we show that a matrix version of the Borda count algorithm, and more surprisingly, an algorithm which performs maximum likelihood estimation under a BTL assumption, both converge to an optimal ranking under a 'low-noise' condition that is strictly more general than BTL. Finally, we propose a new SVM-based algorithm for rank aggregation from pairwise data, and show that this converges to an optimal ranking under an even more general condition that we term 'generalized low-noise'. In all cases, we provide explicit sample complexity bounds for exact recovery of an optimal ranking. Our experiments confirm our theoretical findings and help to shed light on the statistical behavior of various rank aggregation algorithms.",,,118,126,Algorithm; Support vector machine; Ranking SVM; Probability distribution; Pairwise comparison; Statistical assumption; Ranking; PageRank; Borda count; Mathematics,,,,,https://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/rajkumar14.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icml/icml2014.html#RajkumarA14 http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/rajkumar14.pdf http://proceedings.mlr.press/v32/rajkumar14.html,https://jmlr.org/proceedings/papers/v32/rajkumar14.pdf,,,2140560120,,0,003-868-023-351-977; 004-356-769-003-861; 019-706-620-416-491; 023-436-952-259-389; 026-130-665-588-62X; 032-380-829-065-999; 044-305-162-546-975; 052-209-553-791-396; 060-275-798-238-543; 062-210-256-557-086; 073-563-475-784-273; 073-942-785-089-217; 074-476-690-145-141; 074-692-996-960-882; 075-208-362-608-800; 082-298-749-877-760; 091-299-050-457-00X; 094-222-344-008-721; 096-979-791-156-213; 105-628-862-061-546; 106-324-829-952-850; 109-668-006-494-690; 125-667-490-657-695; 129-647-393-947-516; 131-047-904-013-866; 137-940-671-974-155; 144-339-482-558-511; 194-867-508-117-97X,94

This paper aims to propose an analytical pair-wise comparison approach to ranking indicators of human capital in Malaysia. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is employed to integrate the multi-facets preferences of the five criteria of human capital to determine the importance of the four identified indicators. A case study of human capital measurement is presented and the proposed model is applied to facilitate the decision making process. Interviews with three decision makers were administered to collect data over the comparative judgement of human capital measures in Malaysia. The results show that creating result by using knowledge is the most important measurement indicators and employee's skill index is the least important measurement indicator. The overall ranking reflects the importance of measurement indicators in steering Malaysia to become a worthy human capital investment.,107,,22,28,Decision-making; Business; Knowledge economy; Ranking; Judgement; Human capital; Management science; Knowledge management; Developing country; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81982791 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813050179 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81982791.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.394,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.394,1997821792,,0,011-703-868-775-055; 021-153-844-581-44X; 028-454-054-636-147; 033-711-497-118-31X; 036-745-237-774-622; 040-538-371-657-729; 041-563-025-496-329; 055-070-798-326-463; 067-341-125-020-782; 071-317-917-757-357; 071-501-420-538-845; 072-372-712-750-109; 082-523-946-615-012; 083-336-050-729-511; 086-215-877-679-071; 099-520-175-917-218; 113-914-739-374-018; 123-675-666-931-721; 128-529-978-620-742; 136-133-049-439-139; 136-871-166-460-96X; 138-045-683-285-897; 159-785-615-800-91X,12

Comparative judgement outcomes correlated as expected both with test marks and with existing student achievement data, supporting the validity of the approach. Further analysis suggested that teacher judgement privileged scientific understanding, whereas marking privileged factual recall.

To investigate the effects of exogenous attention, previous studies have generally used highly salient cues that reliably trigger attention. However, the cueing threshold of exogenous attention has been unexamined. We investigated whether the attentional effect varies with cue salience. We examined the magnitude of the attentional effect on apparent contrast [Carrasco, M., Ling, S., & Read, S. (2004). Attention alters appearance.

Cue contrast modulated the attentional effect, even at cue contrasts above the level at which observers can perfectly localize the cue; hence, the result is not due to an increase in cue visibility. No attentional effect is observed when the 100% contrast cue is presented after the stimuli, ruling out cue bias or sensory interaction between cues and stimuli as alternative explanations. A second experiment, using the same paradigm with high contrast motion stimuli gave similar results, providing further evidence against a sensory interaction explanation, as the stimuli and task were defined on a visual dimension independent from cue contrast.

The ACJ system uses a web-browser to deliver pairs of candidates’ work to judges. The judges apply their subject expertise to select which of the two sets of work is better in terms of meeting appropriate educational objectives. A quality parameter is estimated for each piece of candidates’ work using the Rasch logistic model to analyse the judges’ decisions. Placing the pieces of work on a measurement scale gives them a rank order. The adaptive nature of ACJ lies in the pairing of essays for each judge. The selection of essays is based on a maximum distance between the quality parameter estimates, allowing useful information to be gained from each paired comparison. This paper reports a study in which ACJ was used to rank order a random sample of 564 essays on a topic in physical geography based on the judgements of a group of 23 teachers and examiners. The reliability of the rank order was 0.97. Evidence is presented for the need for judges to be teaching at the same qualification level as they are judging at. There is a discussion of the factors that need to be addressed before implementing ACJ in summative assessment.",,,,,Rasch model; Machine learning; Logistic regression; Summative assessment; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Paired comparison,,,,,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment/summary https://research.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment/summary,,,2146695179,,0,017-738-075-028-728; 020-492-282-615-504; 040-643-417-873-73X; 048-091-210-665-560; 053-383-650-919-670; 055-671-696-900-616; 061-869-815-688-55X; 062-826-283-401-218; 107-790-959-417-375; 130-744-301-692-166; 139-343-106-919-900; 199-665-658-004-010,12

However, up to now the emphasis in digital tools making use of CJ has lied primarily on efficient algorithms for CJ rather than on providing valuable feedback. Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) investigates the opportunities and constraints of CJ-based feedback and aims to examine the potential of CJ-based feedback for learning. Reporting on design based research, this paper describes the features of D-PAC feedback available at different user levels: the user being assessed (assesse), the user assessing others (assessor) and the user who coordinates the assessment (Performance Assessment Manager (PAM)). Interviews conducted with different users in diverse organizations show that both the characteristics of D-PAC feedback and the acceptance at user level is promising for future use of D-PAC. Despite that further investigations are needed with regard to the contribution of D-PAC feedback for user learning, the characteristics and user acceptance of D-PAC feedback are promising to enlarge the summative scope of CJ to formative assessment and professionalization.",653,,23,38,Competence (human resources); Rubric; Summative assessment; Psychology; Judgement; Design-based research; Professionalization; Formative assessment; Knowledge management; Criticism,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8567947 https://core.ac.uk/display/159328657 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-57744-9_3 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,,10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,2565206676,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 004-540-449-114-589; 009-631-573-859-890; 022-834-501-395-725; 034-259-628-733-602; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-991-030-021-460; 048-091-210-665-560; 049-970-916-129-791; 055-292-929-125-017; 056-808-669-498-642; 059-303-990-732-701; 068-124-584-046-362; 072-618-043-534-026; 083-798-790-671-139; 087-174-854-393-001; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-593-846-802-324; 091-293-280-581-834; 104-175-236-000-695; 121-258-626-550-035; 127-659-660-814-933; 165-708-633-922-222; 182-282-349-748-141; 184-198-628-385-823,2

The current study aimed at evaluating this issue by means of a magnitude comparison task involving Arabic numbers and structured as well as unstructured non-symbolic patterns of squares. In particular, we were interested whether a specific numerical effect, the unit-decade compatibility effect reflecting decomposed processing of tens and units complying with the place-value structure of the Arabic number system, is affected by input notation. Indeed, a reliable unit-decade compatibility effect was observed in the symbolic-digital notation condition but was absent for unstructured non-symbolic notation. However, for structured non-symbolic notation a – albeit negative – compatibility effect was observed as well. Theses results are hard to reconcile with the notion of an abstract representation of number magnitude. Instead, our data support the existence of multiple representations of numerical magnitude. In addition, the current data indicate that it may not be a question of symbolic vs. non-symbolic notation only but also an issue of the structuring of the input notation. While unstructured non-symbolic quantities seemed to be processed holistically we found evidence suggesting at least partially decomposed processing not only for symbolic Arabic numbers but also for structured non-symbolic quantities.",3,,191,191,Structuring; Unitary representation; Computer science; Notation; Magnitude (mathematics); Unitary state; Theoretical computer science; Arabic numerals,abstract/notation-dependent; number magnitude representation; symbolic/non-symbolic,,,Wellcome Trust (088378) United Kingdom,https://philpapers.org/rec/MOEAUO-2 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/339954 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3374956 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00191/full https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/339954 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22712021 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82835135.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00191,22712021,10.3389/fpsyg.2012.00191,1964959555,PMC3374956,0,002-126-320-397-702; 003-406-236-545-496; 003-710-302-053-681; 004-015-641-837-802; 008-461-628-947-121; 011-100-905-938-026; 012-850-886-449-540; 013-539-975-565-02X; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-171-393-111-323; 019-135-231-838-82X; 019-198-395-259-670; 021-901-356-850-672; 023-363-761-448-262; 024-702-311-619-917; 025-273-714-276-887; 025-402-033-432-459; 025-927-886-183-476; 026-617-630-691-234; 030-722-279-149-411; 032-188-208-040-57X; 033-386-758-580-726; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-559-042-610-406; 038-452-699-914-996; 039-079-088-841-357; 040-890-157-331-851; 041-744-175-231-513; 043-015-083-401-178; 045-758-050-964-767; 048-280-422-733-636; 048-752-009-339-611; 050-226-266-734-956; 051-063-453-319-793; 051-472-129-782-759; 055-735-581-155-767; 061-503-605-759-480; 064-745-429-405-288; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-583-756-505-85X; 071-057-839-637-721; 072-849-353-462-759; 079-652-959-557-811; 083-408-184-903-503; 084-525-058-359-286; 086-214-041-467-250; 088-849-249-876-733; 090-673-650-767-109; 090-875-311-443-762; 113-702-048-751-30X; 115-198-196-801-586; 115-821-539-791-01X; 116-975-634-585-183; 122-423-243-764-899; 128-909-793-351-309; 129-213-171-018-887; 146-743-577-348-928,2

Based on the AHP, the paper summarizes and analyzes the Telecommunications Industry knowledge transfer status, analysis shows that knowledge transfer capacity of the telecommunications industry is relatively higher, but the telecommunications industry knowledge transfer value network environment is still in its infancy. So the leaders of telecom industry value network -telecom operators should strengthen the introduction of the knowledge transfer parties to create a better environment of the telecom industry knowledge transfer value network. Key words-knowledge transfer; telecom industry; the analytic hierarchy process I. The introduction of the Analytic Hierarchy Process and the Judgment Matrix Constructor The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was put forward by a famous American operations research expert T.L.Saaty and other people in the 1970s. It is a combination of qualitative and quantitative analysis as well as multiple criteria decision making method. It is a decision-making method that the relevant elements of the decision problem is broken down into a hierarchy of objectives, guidelines, programs, and based on this to conduct qualitative and quantitative analysis. It makes the people’s thinking process hierarchical, quantitative and uses the mathematics to provide quantitative basis in order to analyze, decide and forecast. When using the AHP to analyze problem, we must put the problem hierarchical first. According to the nature of the problem and the total goal, the problem is decomposed into different elements, and we will combine these elements by different levels according to the interrelated factors and affiliation factors to form a multi-level analysis structure model. And finally the system analysis comes down to the lowest level (for the decision-making of the plan, measures, etc) relative to the highest level (total goal) of the determination of the relative importance of the weights or the order scheduling problem of the relative merits. In sorting calculation, the sort problem of each level factor relative to the previous level factors can be simplified to the judgment and comparison of the series pairs of factors. In order to make the comparative judgment quantitative, the AHP introduces a 1-9 scale method, and writes it into a form of judgment matrix. After the formation of the judgment matrix, then through the calculation of the biggest characteristic root and the corresponding characteristic, the relative importance of weights of a certain level factor relative to the previous level can be calculated. After calculating each factor’s single-sort weight of a level relative to the previous level, using the weights of the previous level factor to weight composite can calculate the relative importance of weight of a level factor relative to the previous level. This is called the hierarchy total sort weights. In this way, the relative importance of weights or the ranking value of the relative merits order of the lowest level factors relative to the highest level can be calculated through top to bottom. When the analysis hierarchical model has been built, then we can compare two factors in all factors, give the judgment of the relative importance of each level factor and show it with the appropriate scale. So the compare judgment matrix is constructed. The judgment matrix is not only the basic information of the AHP but also the important basis to calculate the relative importance. Suppose that now we want to compare the influence that some factors x={x1,...,xn}make to a certain factor z, Saaty etc suggested adopting the method that comparing between two factors to establish paired comparison matrix. It is can be interpreted that every time we take two factors xi 、xj and use aij to express the influence of z that xi and xj make. All comparison results can be expressed by matrix A=( aij )n×n,, A is called pair-wise comparison matrix between z-x ( the judgment matrix for short). Easy to see, if the ratio of the influence that xi make to z and make xj to z is aij , then the ratio between xj and xi make to z should be aji=1/aij Definition 1 if matrix A=( aij )n×n, meet (i)aij >0, (ii)aji =1/aij",,,,,Decision problem; Hierarchical database model; Ranking; Knowledge transfer; Hierarchy; Computer science; Enhanced Telecom Operations Map; Telecommunications; Analytic hierarchy process; sort,,,,,https://www.atlantis-press.com/proceedings/citcs-12/2993,http://dx.doi.org/10.2991/citcs.2012.47,,10.2991/citcs.2012.47,2079130723,,0,,1

Rao; Vishal Sardeshpande,"Abstract The need for reliable and renewable energy sources is increasing day by day and with it is the revived interest in the biogas technology, especially when addressing rural cooking and lighting energy needs. MNRE, which is the nodal agency for all biogas programmes, has been promoting around 15 biogas models. However, there is no documentation available on how the models are approved thus, leaving the choice of model to the end users. This has resulted in promotion of the models based on the organisation's (governmental and non-governmental) expertise in constructing certain models rather than the informed choice of the end user. One of the answers to these questions, is a multi-criteria decision making tool which can aid in the promotion of different biogas technologies on the basis of several socio-economic-environmental criteria maybe able to address these questions. The tool can be used to make the decisions from various perspectives e.g the government, the NGOs, the users, etc. This study undertakes an analysis based on the Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) tool for biogas technologies being promoted by GOI with a perspective of overall self reliance of the country. A case study approach has been illustrated for a small biogas plant of 2 m 3 with a perspective of sustainable development.

069-085-895-309-737,CISS - Sparse choice models,,2012,conference proceedings,2012 46th Annual Conference on Information Sciences and Systems (CISS),,IEEE,,Vivek F. Farias; Srikanth Jagabathula; Devavrat Shah,"Choice models, which capture popular preferences over objects of interest, play a key role in making decisions whose eventual outcome is impacted by human choice behavior. In most scenarios, the choice model, which can effectively be viewed as a distribution over permutations, must be learned from observed data. The observed data, in turn, may frequently be viewed as (partial, noisy) information about marginals of this distribution over permutations. As such, the search for an appropriate choice model boils down to learning a distribution over permutations that is (near-)consistent with observed information about this distribution. In this work, we pursue a non-parametric approach which seeks to learn a choice model (i.e. a distribution over permutations) with sparsest possible support, and consistent with observed data. We assume that the data observed consists of noisy information pertaining to the marginals of the choice model we seek to learn. We establish that any choice model admits a ‘very’ sparse approximation in the sense that there exists a choice model whose support is small relative to the dimension of the observed data and whose marginals approximately agree with the observed marginal information. We further show that under, what we dub, ‘signature’ conditions, such a sparse approximation can be found in a computationally efficiently fashion relative to a brute force approach. An empirical study using the American Psychological Association election data-set suggests that our approach manages to unearth useful structural properties of the underlying choice model using the sparse approximation found. Our results further suggest that the signature condition is a potential alternative to the recently popularized Restricted Null Space condition for efficient recovery of sparse models.",,,1,28,Machine learning; Empirical research; Sparse approximation; Existential quantification; Permutation; Artificial intelligence; Brute force; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Correlation and dependence; Kernel (linear algebra),,,,,http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/87680 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6310952 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ciss/ciss2012.html#FariasJS12 http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/87680/Farias_Sparse%20choice.pdf;sequence=1 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006310952 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78052943.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ciss.2012.6310952,,10.1109/ciss.2012.6310952,2009623462,,1,000-590-328-964-720; 003-738-524-524-439; 014-494-954-863-554; 016-540-243-110-297; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-610-192-660-448; 023-436-952-259-389; 023-828-528-665-292; 025-932-262-178-907; 030-317-991-035-013; 032-669-393-671-230; 035-599-508-241-440; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-739-811-452-544; 040-890-416-074-862; 042-627-416-303-850; 044-086-265-298-647; 047-164-545-895-518; 047-477-392-351-487; 048-841-740-735-490; 051-587-456-232-156; 052-217-341-775-087; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-310-338-398-932; 061-756-851-864-046; 066-081-139-618-975; 067-126-500-360-171; 067-671-311-398-860; 069-074-796-890-155; 070-707-122-430-593; 075-388-391-815-80X; 080-508-247-127-118; 081-154-384-693-571; 083-231-400-366-060; 088-185-235-230-617; 092-474-419-202-077; 092-625-511-839-412; 093-472-739-539-696; 095-720-759-868-465; 097-816-365-068-78X; 105-723-055-057-642; 107-618-423-188-100; 107-884-711-391-615; 111-278-931-243-790; 111-439-749-074-665; 114-961-494-660-531; 120-979-769-133-240; 124-783-387-855-855; 127-067-549-501-438; 129-870-899-398-886; 134-262-828-600-508; 136-013-623-806-110; 145-069-531-384-730; 148-356-412-062-000; 156-940-185-306-556; 167-961-295-053-862; 183-818-686-203-950; 188-040-619-588-181,11

Drevets; R. James R. Blair,"Catecholamines, particularly dopamine, have been implicated in various aspects of the reward function including the ability to learn through reinforcement and to modify flexibly responses to changing reinforcement contingencies. We examined the impact of catecholamine depletion (CD) achieved by oral administration of alpha-methyl-paratyrosine (AMPT) on probabilistic reversal learning and passive avoidance (PA) in 15 female subjects with major depressive disorder in full remission (RMDD) and 12 healthy female controls. The CD did not affect significantly the acquisition phase of the reversal learning task. However, CD selectively impaired reversal of the 80-20 contingency pair. In the PA learning task, CD was associated with reduced responding toward rewarding stimuli, although the RMDD and control subjects did not differ regarding these CD-induced changes in reward processing. Interestingly, the performance decrement produced by AMPT on both of these tasks was associated with the level of decreased metabolism in the perigenual anterior cingulate cortex. In an additional examination using the affective Stroop task we found evidence for impaired executive attention as a trait abnormality in MDD. In conclusion, this study showed specific effects of CD on the processing of reward-related stimuli in humans and confirms earlier investigations that show impairments of executive attention as a neuropsychological trait in affective illness.",34,13,2691,2698,Neuropsychology; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Stroop effect; Neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Anterior cingulate cortex; AMPT; Major depressive disorder; Alpha-Methyltyrosine; Affect (psychology),,"Adolescent; Adult; Avoidance Learning/drug effects; Brain/diagnostic imaging; Catecholamines/metabolism; Conditioning, Operant/drug effects; Depressive Disorder, Major/diagnostic imaging; Female; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18/metabolism; Gyrus Cinguli/diagnostic imaging; Humans; Middle Aged; Positron-Emission Tomography; Reversal Learning/drug effects; Reward; Stroop Test; alpha-Methyltyrosine/pharmacology",Catecholamines; Fluorodeoxyglucose F18; alpha-Methyltyrosine,Intramural NIH HHS (Z99 MH999999) United States,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/20402/ https://www.mentalhealthacademy.com.au/journal_archive/acn0935.pdf https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Robert_Blair2/publication/7504176_Applying_a_cognitive_neuroscience_perspective_to_the_disorder_of_psychopathy/links/02bfe513fa33d32445000000.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/11260748 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2783713 http://pubmed.cn/19675538 https://www.nature.com/articles/npp200995 https://www.nature.com/npp/journal/v34/n13/full/npp200995a.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19675538 http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/20402/4/Hasler_Neuropsychopharmacology_Manus.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1038/npp.2009.95,19675538,10.1038/npp.2009.95,2084840077,PMC2783713,0,001-421-217-892-241; 003-459-204-138-596; 005-911-613-661-004; 006-501-457-753-584; 007-185-131-113-557; 007-341-467-232-092; 007-527-215-043-696; 008-093-080-989-951; 008-862-087-700-579; 010-041-542-464-082; 010-349-579-083-751; 010-882-228-479-821; 011-978-504-230-559; 012-723-213-469-975; 016-312-876-779-586; 016-531-523-558-331; 017-455-700-308-806; 018-042-147-331-648; 018-589-440-760-088; 018-848-275-926-972; 023-899-276-295-894; 023-934-638-706-859; 026-086-602-930-541; 026-625-343-362-980; 028-317-514-775-500; 029-630-852-319-361; 030-915-168-760-251; 035-420-376-787-640; 037-290-150-413-988; 038-092-037-462-074; 039-501-705-118-094; 041-512-684-959-067; 042-740-964-490-823; 044-355-534-128-201; 052-536-047-007-237; 054-582-876-297-69X; 062-848-426-437-064; 065-871-700-043-311; 066-996-206-471-500; 070-634-517-935-92X; 071-274-642-268-839; 075-824-322-929-967; 081-285-312-426-781; 081-375-342-975-289; 085-608-865-436-575; 086-281-072-297-418; 103-173-109-859-469; 108-418-018-649-524; 113-241-503-747-160; 120-788-658-557-946; 127-133-536-420-682; 138-280-559-712-468; 144-413-340-806-13X; 171-593-731-182-440,26

Accordingly, as a basis for developing augmented cognition applications, it is important to understand how people apprehend numerical information and whether there are systematic limitations on their ability to do so accurately. This paper reports research on the role of non-numerical spatial information and of numerical representations in adults' judgments about large-numerosity spatial arrays. Arrays that contained more open space tended to be perceived as less numerous than ones with less open space. Further, the accuracy with which viewers estimated the arrays' numerosities bore little relation to their success in identifying the more numerous array in each pair. Numerical judgments thus are heavily influenced by spatial information that is not necessarily a reliable cue to numerosity. While some information about absolute numerosity is extracted in making numerical comparisons, it appears to be very imprecise.",,,157,165,Augmented cognition; Artificial intelligence; Spatial analysis; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Contour length; Spatial factor; Computer vision; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-73216-7_18 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/hci/hci2007-16.html#Sophian07 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-540-73216-7_18,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-540-73216-7_18,,10.1007/978-3-540-73216-7_18,1599550417,,0,008-660-756-899-541; 013-038-761-988-056; 016-227-375-936-145; 022-049-380-598-783; 043-288-458-558-686; 048-889-201-158-674; 053-425-967-063-64X; 058-213-217-734-122; 071-359-050-983-153; 092-568-831-144-646; 141-573-208-820-528,16

Smith; Paul Windschitl; Jason Rose,"<p>This project focuses on what we call referent-specific judgments (i.e., judgments that require specific comparisons).  They can have many forms—including comparative judgments, probability judgments, proportion estimates, and ranks—but the different forms seem vulnerable to similar biases. We present a Referent-Specific Judgment Framework (RSJF) aimed at providing a more organized understanding of these biases and the explanations that have been proposed for them across distinct literatures.  Two studies tested predictions of RSJF as they apply to similarities and differences in bias among comparative and probability judgments that qualify as referent-specific judgments.  The results revealed the expected similarities and differences, and they more generally supported the utility of theorizing about referent-specific judgments as a coherent class of judgments.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/uh6nz,,10.31234/osf.io/uh6nz,,,0,,0

Their spatial-numerical perceptions are assumed to be automatic in nature and have been found to affect performance in various numerical tasks. The current study tested whether synesthetic number-space associations can modulate the well-established Size Congruency Effect (SiCE), which is considered to be an indication for the automaticity of numerical processing. Two groups, number-space synesthetes and matched controls, were tested on a numerical Stroop task (Henik and Tzelgov, 1982). In separate blocks, participants were presented with two digits and asked to make comparative judgments regarding either numerical values (numerical comparison) or physical size (physical comparison). Both dimensions were manipulated orthogonally, creating three congruency levels: congruent (e.g., 2 7), incongruent (e.g., 2 7) and neutral (e.g., 2 2 and 2 7 for physical and numerical blocks, respectively). For the numerical block, both synesthetes and controls showed the classic SiCE, indicating similar automatic processing of physical magnitude. However, in the physical block, synesthetes showed a lack of automatic numerical magnitude processing when the numbers to be compared were presented incompatibly with their relative position on the synesthetic number-form. This finding strongly suggests that synesthetes’ number-space perceptions affect their ability to automatically process the semantic meaning of numerals. The involvement of space in automatic magnitude processing for number-space synesthetes and non-synesthetes is discussed.",49,5,1352,1362,Semantics; Congruence (geometry); Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognitive psychology; Numeral system; Perception; Synesthesia; Perceptual Disorders; Automaticity; Social psychology,,"Adult; Attention/physiology; Female; Humans; Pattern Recognition, Visual/physiology; Perceptual Disorders/physiopathology; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology; Semantics; Space Perception/physiology; Synesthesia; Young Adult",,Wellcome Trust (088378) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT88378) United Kingdom,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3428851 https://www.psy.ox.ac.uk/publications/399427 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3428851/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roi_Cohen_Kadosh/publication/224947976_Implications_of_number-space_synesthesia_on_the_automaticity_of_numerical_processing/links/0912f50a0eb70595d8000000.pdf https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/399427 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010945212001037 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82201906.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cortex.2012.03.019,22578710,10.1016/j.cortex.2012.03.019,2056013452,PMC3428851,0,000-203-307-444-846; 000-495-638-642-502; 001-244-253-407-376; 001-768-224-718-965; 005-374-265-419-666; 006-358-757-495-725; 010-140-848-414-399; 011-630-395-210-331; 014-043-776-728-225; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-149-989-076-484; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-576-453-371-676; 016-811-389-011-402; 017-941-945-572-035; 018-533-905-176-39X; 023-290-232-151-661; 025-273-714-276-887; 025-378-590-837-398; 025-717-916-325-389; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-869-715-499-155; 033-983-526-594-841; 034-196-916-967-344; 034-477-322-102-774; 037-559-042-610-406; 038-395-026-012-885; 041-443-014-739-771; 041-744-175-231-513; 047-571-584-151-480; 047-945-434-818-976; 049-725-492-962-923; 052-327-341-064-864; 060-206-521-997-513; 066-089-489-617-442; 079-276-930-986-288; 079-868-710-530-712; 083-553-608-069-016; 083-688-007-922-85X; 086-922-926-484-143; 087-074-495-657-299; 088-849-249-876-733; 090-673-650-767-109; 092-715-514-577-680; 096-974-841-889-042; 114-858-026-742-426; 118-682-881-059-758; 120-628-896-618-406; 120-791-951-129-93X; 122-195-468-484-095; 122-238-284-883-363; 122-501-945-096-419; 131-040-957-155-671; 140-620-082-925-684; 144-747-377-111-26X; 148-043-544-952-446; 153-174-100-314-196; 163-028-741-520-00X,10

For this purpose, in this study, we use Fuzzy set theory into the measurement of performance and apply Analytic hierarchy process (AHP) in obtaining criteria weight and technique for order preference by similarity to the ideal solution (TOPSIS) in ranking. A Fuzzy MCDM is an approach for evaluating decision alternatives involving subjective judgments made by a group of decision makers. A pair-wise comparison process is used to help individual decision makers make comparative judgments, and a linguistic rating method is used for making absolute judgments.

PVIC includes two dimensions of teacher quality that are essential in effective inclusive classrooms: (positive) teacher-student interactions (TSI) and differentiated instruction (DI). It is the first study to measure pre-service teachers' professional vision through a holistic video-based approach using comparative judgement. The validity framework of Chan (2014) was used to investigate construct validity.

The starting point for our empirical investigations is the view that the task of neuroscience is to integrate itself with other forms of knowledge, rather than to seek to supplant them. In our recent work, we examined a particular aspect of the appreciation of artwork using present-day functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Our results emphasized the continuity between viewing artwork and other human cognitive activities. We also showed that appreciation of a particular aspect of artwork, namely authenticity, depends upon the co-ordinated activity between the brain regions involved in multiple decision making and those responsible for processing visual information. The findings about brain function probably have no specific consequences for understanding how people respond to the art of Rembrandt in comparison with their response to other artworks. However, the use of images of Rembrandt's portraits, his most intimate and personal works, clearly had a significant impact upon our viewers, even though they have been spatially confined to the interior of an MRI scanner at the time of viewing. Neuroscientific studies of humans viewing artwork have the capacity to reveal the diversity of human cognitive responses that may be induced by external advice or context as people view artwork in a variety of frameworks and settings.",8,,76,,,Rembrandt; art; authenticity; cortical response properties; fMRI,,,Medical Research Council (G0400132) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0700399) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82845417.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2014.00076,24795552,10.3389/fnins.2014.00076,,PMC4001048,0,002-802-743-701-375; 006-014-026-735-415; 007-128-944-072-480; 008-951-330-640-946; 010-346-437-461-012; 011-692-222-351-471; 023-211-156-419-268; 037-802-361-004-814; 045-385-562-884-155; 051-669-111-325-620; 054-241-320-296-127; 056-007-448-185-108; 073-196-646-267-86X; 073-989-199-405-350; 089-780-532-885-68X; 101-639-724-415-543; 122-024-496-915-423; 133-257-851-168-407; 150-939-440-723-044,1

Promentilla; Tohru Furuichi; Kazuei Ishii; Noboru Tanikawa,"The Analytic Network Process (ANP) has been proposed to incorporate interdependence and feedback effect in the prioritization of remedial countermeasures using a hierarchical network decision model, but this approach seems to be incapable of capturing the vagueness and fuzziness during value judgment elicitation. The aim of this paper is to present an evaluation method using a fuzzy ANP (FANP) approach to address this shortcoming. Triangular fuzzy numbers (TFN) and their degree of fuzziness are used in the semantic scale as human judgment expressed in natural language is most often vague and fuzzy. The method employs the alpha-cuts, interval arithmetic and optimism index to transform the fuzzy comparative judgment matrix into set of crisp matrices, and then calculates the desired priorities using the eigenvector method. A numerical example, which was drawn from a real-life case study of an uncontrolled landfill in Japan, is presented to demonstrate the process. Results from the sensitivity analysis describe how the fuzziness in judgment could affect the solution robustness of the prioritization method. The proposed FANP approach therefore could effectively deal with the uncertain judgment inherent in the decision making process and derive the meaningful priorities explicitly from a complex decision structure in the evaluation of contaminated site remedial countermeasures.",88,3,479,495,Decision-making; Data mining; Engineering; Analytic network process; Fuzzy number; Interval arithmetic; Operations management; Vagueness; Value judgment; Fuzzy logic; Decision model,,Algorithms; Environmental Restoration and Remediation; Fuzzy Logic,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147970700093X http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030147970700093X https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17467879 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/2098363,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.03.013,17467879,10.1016/j.jenvman.2007.03.013,2000738091,,0,002-282-191-803-851; 007-255-359-492-232; 010-812-941-614-60X; 011-882-910-241-062; 020-435-137-460-760; 021-410-964-275-10X; 023-038-253-967-147; 024-936-905-588-267; 027-083-769-459-213; 028-849-321-146-844; 030-733-094-692-470; 034-173-889-237-167; 034-342-137-259-35X; 037-423-792-391-123; 039-128-728-508-463; 039-653-716-971-86X; 042-375-057-025-888; 053-376-181-740-743; 054-900-494-274-944; 056-373-919-682-902; 057-468-831-419-18X; 059-380-034-644-479; 067-341-125-020-782; 068-369-080-680-082; 069-367-020-695-394; 085-189-812-403-67X; 091-006-744-618-89X; 091-681-693-508-242; 094-740-936-945-09X; 102-496-748-953-099; 109-620-347-157-817; 122-111-875-781-870; 123-777-319-970-408; 129-008-267-849-025; 131-161-724-039-419; 143-068-406-755-996; 155-141-751-338-53X; 160-187-734-232-789; 168-896-029-919-932; 171-781-002-999-977; 195-202-477-936-04X,152

Shah; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Adityanand Guntuboyina; Martin J. Wainwright,"There are various parametric models for analyzing pairwise comparison data, including the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, but their reliance on strong parametric assumptions is limiting. In this work, we study a flexible model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes parametric models including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated at the same rate as in standard parametric models. On the other hand, unlike in the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the minimax-optimal estimator in the stochastically transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations.",,,11,20,Parametric statistics; Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Minimax; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Transitive relation; Parametric model; Mathematics,,,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/shahb16.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3045393 http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/shahb16.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icml/icml2016.html#ShahBGW16,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v48/shahb16.html,,,2572029201,,0,003-722-377-136-05X; 016-138-352-817-050; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-304-036-982-259; 025-009-658-071-875; 032-718-506-620-930; 033-920-290-313-776; 034-901-673-085-689; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-829-579-281-766; 045-885-584-509-736; 050-943-988-713-681; 065-267-831-248-009; 065-524-837-869-927; 070-331-031-103-877; 085-982-503-333-800; 088-185-235-230-617; 103-111-574-598-758; 105-197-803-566-972; 137-940-671-974-155; 147-543-426-548-72X; 147-790-916-717-782; 152-625-606-175-254; 152-760-702-983-990; 155-729-366-689-349; 161-247-307-055-667,18

It allows the ranking values of some alternatives (herein referred to as concepts) to be initially known, whilst ranks for other concepts have yet to be estimated. To calculate the missing ranks it is assumed that the priority of every single concept can be determined as the weighted arithmetic mean of the priorities of all the other concepts. It has been shown that the problem has an admissible solution if the inconsistency of the pairwise comparisons is not too high. The proposed approach adopts heuristics according to which a weighted geometric mean is used to determine the missing priorities. In this approach, despite increased complexity, a solution always exists and its existence does not depend on the inconsistency or reciprocity of the input matrix. Thus, the presented approach might be appropriate for a larger number of problems than previous methods. Moreover, it turns out that the geometric approach, as proposed in the article, can be optimal. The optimality condition is presented in the form of a corresponding theorem. A formal definition of the proposed geometric heuristics is accompanied by two numerical examples.",62,3,529,543,Weighted geometric mean; Mathematical optimization; Heuristics; Matrix (mathematics); Heuristic; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Mathematics; Analytic hierarchy process; Weighted arithmetic mean; Algorithm; Weighted geometric mean; Heuristics; Matrix (mathematics); Heuristic; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Formal description; Mathematics; Weighted arithmetic mean,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-014-0253-4 http://core.ac.uk/display/25022117 https://paperity.org/p/52221273/heuristic-rating-estimation-geometric-approach https://arxiv.org/abs/1404.6981 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1404.html#KulakowskiGW14 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/jglopt/v62y2015i3p529-543.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10898-014-0253-4 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81824041.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10898-014-0253-4,,10.1007/s10898-014-0253-4,2159543792; 3105654523,,0,003-895-320-956-909; 006-292-024-020-432; 006-715-600-922-621; 009-743-097-643-728; 009-881-393-198-900; 030-614-604-627-790; 031-167-148-604-214; 032-096-904-158-91X; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-133-706-587-245; 047-108-373-485-451; 051-525-616-582-208; 054-244-923-299-670; 057-038-371-738-322; 060-907-762-045-099; 061-703-176-018-76X; 067-293-544-741-847; 078-797-661-745-239; 080-584-882-489-243; 086-092-880-174-085; 090-182-186-756-679; 091-681-693-508-242; 106-299-068-098-167; 110-989-733-783-811; 116-775-079-115-409; 142-718-762-497-001; 145-141-201-645-081; 154-556-244-657-593; 164-064-718-436-744; 192-078-021-601-677,8

Small; Don A. Moore,"People believe that they are better than others on easy tasks and worse than others on difficult tasks. Previous attempts to explain these better-than-average and worse-than-average effects have invoked bias and motivation as causes. This paper develops a more parsimonious account, the differential information explanation, which assumes only that people typically have better information about themselves than they do about others. When one's own performance is exceptional (either good or bad), it is often reasonable to assume others' will be less so. Consequently, people estimate the performance of others as less extreme (more regressive) than their own. The result is that people believe they are above average on easy tasks and below average on difficult tasks. These effects are exacerbated when people have accurate information about their performances, increasing the natural discrepancy between knowledge of self and others. The effects are attenuated when people obtain accurate information about the performances of others.",,,,,Psychology; Egocentrism; Social comparison theory; Differential information; Social facilitation; Self-knowledge; Overconfidence effect; Social psychology,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID953569_code327418.pdf?abstractid=853465&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=853465 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=853465,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.853465,,10.2139/ssrn.853465,2070678089,,0,003-823-085-804-979; 004-459-184-623-821; 004-688-760-041-053; 005-105-404-496-456; 005-780-876-195-626; 007-082-882-552-460; 007-569-428-948-03X; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-527-796-645-068; 008-723-463-031-98X; 012-124-178-548-103; 012-419-306-168-454; 016-509-402-794-767; 018-532-140-455-519; 019-415-581-803-244; 020-419-379-272-121; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-021-272-761-642; 023-639-356-479-473; 025-498-944-344-037; 029-091-639-120-134; 030-123-718-813-763; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-534-314-680-166; 033-049-944-423-030; 036-962-225-909-922; 037-810-104-051-02X; 040-261-830-869-773; 041-499-335-862-394; 042-565-490-478-156; 044-221-822-340-940; 044-765-092-858-566; 049-156-922-816-938; 049-325-626-588-234; 054-938-373-448-403; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-979-804-290-796; 061-142-370-003-855; 064-990-488-097-173; 065-351-381-849-959; 065-796-557-496-125; 066-922-859-214-884; 072-771-006-732-788; 073-663-750-011-207; 077-534-894-375-688; 079-463-629-173-564; 079-620-280-853-749; 081-476-781-835-336; 086-373-927-285-964; 090-589-468-914-713; 093-584-053-097-666; 094-133-760-710-451; 096-792-630-788-615; 098-052-936-614-844; 102-795-542-679-792; 105-583-418-831-173; 105-916-960-623-916; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 110-433-702-594-897; 110-460-562-767-55X; 110-637-461-773-230; 111-659-884-856-63X; 113-047-964-327-688; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-762-136-028-844; 119-897-887-862-263; 120-941-958-292-714; 123-711-683-498-099; 124-002-183-259-416; 124-656-535-257-223; 140-397-553-301-28X; 142-392-033-523-68X; 142-597-308-096-357; 148-223-435-969-407; 157-275-055-135-727; 159-661-019-414-284; 160-652-532-329-575; 165-707-840-836-402; 180-613-410-178-805,31

In 5 experiments, the authors tested the notion of automatic activation of numerical magnitude by asking participants to compare, while timed, pairs of numerical arrays on either numerosity or numerical value. Garner and Stroop effects were used to gauge the degree of interactive processing. The results showed that both effects were sensitive to the discriminability of values along the constituent dimensions, to the number of stimulus values used, and to practice and motivation. Notably, Stroop and Garner effects were eliminated under several conditions. These findings are incompatible with claims of obligatory activation of meaning in numerical processing, and they cast doubt on theories positing automatic processing of semantic information for alphanumerical symbols.",28,2,259,274,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Stroop effect; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Automatic processing; Semantic information; Interactive processing; Automaticity,,Adult; Attention; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematics; Random Allocation; Semantics,,,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0278-7393.28.2.259 http://freud.tau.ac.il/~algomd/Pansky%20&%20Algom%20%282002%29.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/23554005 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11911383,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037//0278-7393.28.2.259,11911383,10.1037//0278-7393.28.2.259,1990740366,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 000-836-788-313-256; 001-244-253-407-376; 001-316-444-050-939; 003-308-778-447-55X; 004-604-506-792-053; 005-552-384-721-816; 008-260-985-157-012; 008-353-829-126-540; 008-798-573-492-150; 009-688-288-795-004; 010-409-693-689-871; 011-550-521-002-040; 012-627-787-071-501; 013-621-298-749-675; 015-353-433-193-425; 015-395-222-668-449; 019-777-112-821-405; 019-974-469-455-666; 020-515-094-121-717; 024-162-564-979-406; 024-189-717-981-292; 024-809-443-728-111; 027-544-589-555-645; 028-523-583-927-755; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-212-011-374-167; 030-242-387-577-541; 031-618-061-643-974; 031-689-151-803-044; 032-229-108-136-564; 033-603-297-237-092; 038-125-839-714-42X; 038-646-906-665-722; 042-403-631-882-733; 042-852-220-542-295; 044-754-335-339-40X; 044-789-282-522-154; 045-034-175-888-960; 046-361-747-944-505; 048-889-201-158-674; 048-935-524-968-684; 050-920-091-472-041; 051-375-460-658-438; 054-069-130-060-840; 055-026-521-300-430; 055-175-889-753-779; 055-473-321-412-256; 056-170-806-678-309; 057-377-691-391-571; 058-027-946-447-925; 058-484-878-223-236; 059-689-351-899-825; 060-290-302-293-721; 061-266-607-128-096; 061-782-403-879-251; 062-175-206-833-176; 064-156-231-240-961; 064-219-874-144-039; 064-356-485-171-106; 065-056-068-237-954; 066-248-843-561-177; 067-033-829-394-657; 067-402-786-755-256; 068-375-554-756-300; 070-177-167-231-242; 070-872-784-735-627; 072-750-761-802-425; 075-095-585-794-681; 078-962-424-023-247; 083-665-507-689-714; 083-833-436-627-11X; 089-083-421-021-068; 089-710-266-921-508; 090-872-228-365-667; 093-382-232-201-902; 098-420-272-837-936; 099-263-785-143-219; 101-483-170-386-681; 103-115-912-331-916; 105-013-237-049-284; 114-111-061-400-063; 115-565-064-358-086; 116-789-807-240-134; 117-215-222-437-007; 118-901-577-914-577; 118-953-998-330-494; 121-192-895-866-522; 123-141-712-296-575; 123-859-270-984-698; 123-886-609-335-640; 129-032-914-840-116; 129-656-524-491-630; 140-852-236-865-139; 144-747-377-111-26X; 148-214-528-359-814; 150-005-610-563-452; 162-420-224-609-591; 170-052-405-183-028; 174-566-696-709-387; 175-417-961-076-582; 176-017-510-665-867; 176-587-564-919-089; 178-326-429-892-116; 185-013-290-806-469; 189-767-850-630-438; 193-153-831-242-550; 194-332-467-576-094; 198-848-281-840-099,80

Within the Cobb‐Douglas framework, stronger evidence for aggregate increasing returns is found among samples depicting economies in the early stages of development. The CES framework in turn supports aggregate scale economies for advanced economies, while unitary elasticity of substitution cannot be rejected for less developed economies, giving further support for the Cobb‐Douglas estimates.Research limitations/implications – Given that evidence for scale economies is found within different estimation frameworks for different groups of economies, comparative judgment is prevented.

The suit can ""freeze"" users' body parts, for example during a game in order to provide the physical sensation of being frozen by an enemy. In this paper we first present the Frozen Suit concept and its potential applications. We then systematically investigate how to design jamming patches in order to sufficiently restrict an arm or a leg. In particular we used low-fidelity prototypes to explore the restricting power of different material and particles. In order to push this analysis further we conducted a controlled experiment in order to compare the perceived stiffness of different patches sizes attached to the elbow. We performed a paired comparison experience and used a Bradley-Terry-Luce model to analyze the subjective feedback from participants. We found that 20cm long x 7cm large is the most restrictive patch and that an increase in patch area correlates with an increase in perceived stiffness (quadratic). We finish by presenting a use case application with a game that we implemented where enemies can freeze the player.",,,2440,2448,Quadratic equation; Wearable computer; Haptic technology; Jamming; Stiffness; restrict; Controlled experiment; Computer science; Simulation; User interface,,,,Leverhulme Trust,https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/frozen-suit-designing-a-changeable-stiffness-suit-and-its-applica https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/chi/chi2017.html#MaimaniR17 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/files/113116013/Anne_Roudaut_Frozen_Suit_Toward_a_Changeable_Stiffness_Suit_and_its_Application_for_Haptic_Games.pdf https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/frozen-suit(89b3d6b6-c66d-4291-b940-7da23697371c).html https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=3025453.3025655 https://doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025655 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/113116013/Anne_Roudaut_Frozen_Suit_Toward_a_Changeable_Stiffness_Suit_and_its_Application_for_Haptic_Games.pdf https://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3025453.3025655 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83929853.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3025453.3025655,,10.1145/3025453.3025655,2611634658,,0,000-466-939-473-762; 001-853-620-938-675; 003-604-733-606-349; 004-760-744-190-52X; 007-278-211-561-58X; 007-528-659-499-840; 007-848-403-976-351; 012-436-422-984-138; 018-269-445-638-29X; 023-730-571-242-548; 035-371-804-949-063; 035-400-839-519-610; 039-254-635-672-894; 047-168-224-034-790; 050-943-988-713-681; 062-298-251-303-203; 068-822-146-042-917; 069-941-515-113-169; 082-612-010-145-214; 083-904-480-229-560; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-684-233-784-145; 095-592-093-169-022; 108-694-710-037-445; 109-661-057-930-673; 138-326-322-091-238; 143-996-324-513-442; 146-302-759-291-383,21

As a vital facility, this condition may lead to disastrous condition. Thus, the objective of this paper is to recommend petrol filling station location which is safe for environment and living community in surrounding. As the extend of previous work which is focus on stakeholders’ preference, this current work emphasized on subsurface condition which may influence the stability of petrol filling station infrastructure. However, the result of previous study still will be presented to keep the good coherence of the discussion. Three stages have been set up to reach the objective of this study. Firstly, assess the stakeholder's preference for petrol filling location criteria using AHP method. Secondly, assess and mapping the seismic microzonation using fuzzy clustering method. Thirdly, suitability analysis based on stakeholder's preference and seismic microzonation to find recommended location using GIS method. As the result of the study shows that based on stakeholder's preference, the proper selection of land use criteria appears as the most important criteria for determining petrol filling station location and yielded 31,2% influence. Based on seismic microzonation, the North part of Surabaya mainland from East to West which is near to Madura Straight is high susceptible for local seismic. As a conclusion based on the overlay mapping of these two findings, the Central part of Surabaya heading to West is the most suitable location for petrol filling station. The result of this study could be used as an evaluation for existing petrol filling station location or either for future preference. In another hand, it could be a very useful recommendation for zoning regulation to control the development of petrol filling station which doesn’t concern environmental safety.",227,,115,123,Suitability analysis; Fuzzy clustering; Stakeholder; Transport engineering; Seismic microzonation; Computer science; Geographic information system; Land use; Zoning; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042816307364 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042816307364 https://core.ac.uk/display/82633795 https://trid.trb.org/view/1418925 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82633795.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.051,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2016.06.051,2502142617,,0,009-876-086-528-854; 050-175-779-080-049; 054-306-325-030-744; 065-908-232-542-545; 067-341-125-020-782; 075-568-727-792-815; 094-881-485-482-901; 104-796-374-347-437; 119-735-713-316-500; 161-206-584-725-728,1

While representation of decision processes, design, judicial ownership, the apparent neutrality of data, and 'choice' are all crucial to allaying judicial concern about embracing technological support, it is suggested here that the deepest concern lies in the judicial discourse of 'balance' between formal and substantive visions of justice. Outlining the development of aggregate decision support systems, the article considers the case of New South Wales, which has the longest established judicial decision support system. Revealing a marked judicial ambivalence either to endorse officially, or, to dismiss that system the paper asks whether this ambivalence is simply a symptom of a deeper malaise, namely a 'jurisprudential incoherence' in judicial decisionmaking. Examining the notion of 'jurisprudential incoherence' in judicial thought and behaviour, the article reveals that the ass...",14,3,297,316,Judicial opinion; Decision support system; Vision; Ambivalence; Judicial discretion; Political science; Law; Penology; Neutrality; Judicial activism,,,,,https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/4841239/Resolute_Ambivalence_IRLCT2000Tata.pdf http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/713673373 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/resolute-ambivalence-why-judiciaries-do-not-instititionalise-thei https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/29513/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713673373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713673373,,10.1080/713673373,2169301143,,0,002-018-546-052-688; 002-818-812-343-564; 009-594-063-752-313; 013-913-254-855-913; 016-522-203-073-621; 017-517-584-723-981; 019-779-898-581-296; 022-247-222-650-15X; 023-118-021-870-207; 025-525-455-991-998; 027-758-842-307-738; 028-230-082-227-102; 031-688-084-083-176; 031-752-126-650-815; 032-451-221-791-517; 034-720-276-499-666; 038-458-722-430-066; 039-033-422-991-948; 039-476-291-824-877; 039-760-938-724-411; 041-279-902-414-164; 042-404-546-733-72X; 042-590-933-047-588; 052-537-480-048-659; 057-388-154-588-399; 069-943-398-745-771; 073-913-119-120-910; 082-236-679-852-23X; 086-922-688-607-186; 088-707-436-703-025; 090-030-348-958-546; 090-091-460-642-364; 091-473-244-475-08X; 092-867-433-493-816; 094-141-171-647-706; 096-698-651-042-387; 107-292-500-344-350; 109-407-059-691-377; 113-098-680-720-250; 120-988-975-377-611; 121-376-088-054-591; 130-555-949-318-684; 134-473-287-349-938; 136-765-997-354-827; 136-869-639-852-259; 140-132-629-007-754; 143-141-362-033-139; 144-028-806-895-402; 147-913-953-931-275; 148-372-100-102-595; 152-794-214-727-555,13

The first type of model was a fuzzy theoretical extension of the additive difference model for preference that was used to explain ambiguous preference strength. The second was a fuzzy logic model for explaining ambiguous preference in which preference strength was bounded, such as a probability measure. In both models, multi-attribute weighting parameters and all attribute values were assumed to be asymmetric fuzzy L-R numbers. For each model, a method of parameter estimation using fuzzy regression analysis was proposed. Numerical examples were also provided for comparison.

LaMonica; Richard S.E. Keefe; Philip D. Harvey; James M. Gold; Terry E. Goldberg,"While functioning in multiple domains declines with age, emotional regulation appears to remain preserved in older adults. The Emotion Inhibition (Emotional Stroop) Test requires participants to name the ink color in which neutrally- and emotionally-valenced words are printed. It was employed in the current investigation as a measure of affective regulation in the context of an interference task in relation to age. Results demonstrated that while participants ranging from 20 to 50 years of age performed significantly worse on the emotion Stroop Inhibition relative to the neutral Stroop Inhibition condition, subjects over 60 years of age displayed the converse of this pattern, performing better on the emotion than the neutral condition, suggesting that they are less affected by the emotional impact of the positive and negative words used in the former condition. This pattern of age-related change in the ability to manage emotion may be related to blunting of affective signaling in limbic structures or, at the psychological level, focusing on emotional regulation.",2,,,,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Stroop effect; Converse; Psychological level; Amygdala; Life span; Emotional regulation; Differential effects; Affect (psychology),aging; amygdala; anterior cingulate; cognitive control; emotional Stroop paradigm; emotional regulation,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2955493 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20953250 http://core.ac.uk/display/26485908 http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141/pdf https://miami.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/differential-effects-of-emotional-information-on-interference-tas https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82832692.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141,20953250,10.3389/fnagi.2010.00141,2069928735,PMC2955493,0,010-919-092-899-363; 012-427-046-765-147; 013-680-466-644-056; 018-693-830-182-906; 023-231-757-537-217; 023-939-284-322-710; 024-658-888-415-032; 027-425-225-617-903; 027-616-657-637-459; 033-940-600-470-688; 036-453-356-384-956; 040-143-160-009-872; 041-008-190-601-994; 041-409-910-868-310; 060-888-209-173-721; 068-194-867-843-63X; 070-773-398-162-740; 082-840-215-288-352; 091-063-244-238-285; 091-192-256-547-334; 101-950-137-718-533; 102-418-194-412-261; 108-639-491-208-707; 167-649-560-728-327,15
073-118-475-154-962,Judgments in causal chains: The impact of positive and negative motives and outcomes on lay attributions,,2014,,,,,,Briar Helen Moir,"Research on attributions about several events in causal chains has focused on chains ending in negative outcomes and has not examined positive outcomes and actions (e.g., Hilton, McClure, & Sutton, 2010; Lagnado & Channon, 2008; McClure, Hilton, & Sutton, 2007). On the other hand, research on attributions for positive and negative events has examined judgments about one event in the chain and has not examined effects on other causes in the chain or made comparative judgments about physical causes that produce similar effects to actions (e.g., Alicke, 1992; Alicke, Rose, & Bloom, 2011). This thesis integrates these two lines of research. Six studies examined judgments about two consecutive events (intentional actions and physical events) in chains leading to positive as well as negative outcomes. The intentional action was the same action (e.g. a man started a fire) that differed in motive (positive or negative). The physical event had the same causal effect as the action (e.g., a lightning strike started a fire), or was a physical event (e.g., strong wind) that occurred later in the causal chain.; ; The results replicate previous findings that when both actions and outcomes are negative, participants rate intentional actions more causal and blameworthy than physical events. However, when the intended outcomes fail to eventuate or positively motivated actions pre-empt positive outcomes, two distinct patterns emerged: A mismatch effect that explains the cause of the outcome; and a motive effect that explains judgments of culpability (measured by judgments of blame and punitiveness in these studies). Specifically, judgments of cause, responsibility, intentionality and foresight follow the same pattern that reflects the congruence between the valence of the agent‟s motive and the outcome. In contrast, judgments of culpability follow a different pattern where motive and outcome information have independent effects. Notably, it is the moral intent of actions that primarily determines judgments of culpability. The valence of the outcome plays a secondary role and amplifies ratings.; ; These results show that the important psychological and legal concepts of intentionality, abnormality, foresight, proximity, and outcome information are core determinants in lay attributions (e.g., Hart & Honore, 1985; Heider, 1958; Kelley, 1973; Weiner, 1995). But it is valence that plays the critical role in shaping lay reasoning. Several theoretical approaches applied in previous research on causal chains are examined, for example, Alicke's (2000) culpable control model, Tetlock's (2002) social functionalist model, and Spellman's (1997) crediting causality model. Yet none of the theories are able to account for the findings for chains that include positive actions or positive outcomes. The theoretical scope of this thesis was expanded in Study 6 to include research on the folk concept of intentionality, hindsight, and actor-observer biases (Fischhoff, 1975; Kashima, McKintyre, & Clifford, 1998; Malle & Knobe, 1997; Malle, Knobe, & Nelson,…",,,,,Hindsight bias; Attribution; Psychology; Causality; Culpability; Blame; Motif (music); Functionalism (philosophy of mind); Social psychology; Causal chain,,,,,http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/3277,http://researcharchive.vuw.ac.nz/handle/10063/3277,,,1563860966,,0,,0

A strong parallelism between the processing of these three magnitudes has been revealed by similar behavioral signatures (e.g., Weber-Fechner's law, the distance effect) and reciprocal interference effects. Here, we extend the behavioral evidence for a common magnitude processing mechanism by exploring whether the under- and overestimation patterns observed during numerical perception and production tasks are also present in length and duration perception and production. In a first experiment, participants had to perform two estimation tasks (i.e., perception and production) on three magnitudes (i.e., numerosities, lengths, and durations). The results demonstrate similar patterns for the three magnitudes: underestimation was observed in all perception tasks, whereas overestimation was found in all production tasks. A second experiment ensured that this pattern of under- and over-estimation was not solely generated by the mere process of perceiving or producing something. Participants were required to estimate the alphabetical position of a letter (i.e., perception task) or to produce the letter corresponding to a given position (i.e., production task). No under- or overestimation were observed in this experiment, which suggests that the process of perceiving or producing something alone cannot explain the systematic pattern of estimation observed on magnitudes. Together, these findings strengthen the idea that magnitude estimations share a common metric system, requiring similar mechanisms and/or representations.",4,,449,449,Artificial intelligence; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognitive psychology; Metric system; Perception; Reciprocal; Magnitude processing; Distance effect; Computer science; Magnitude (mathematics); Posterior parietal cortex,duration; estimation; length; magnitude processing; numerosity,,,,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00449/pdf https://www.uclouvain.be/cps/ucl/doc/ir-ipsy/documents/Crollen_Frontiers13.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00449/full http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3717486 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00449/full http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23885244 https://core.ac.uk/display/26226801 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:134390 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82872938.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00449,23885244,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00449,2045349222,PMC3717486,0,000-624-769-297-989; 001-156-714-394-37X; 004-521-565-149-566; 004-961-011-433-134; 005-427-625-373-902; 005-470-506-847-814; 005-511-550-795-992; 005-881-575-136-027; 006-232-821-552-111; 006-784-209-901-819; 007-996-363-197-55X; 009-420-062-605-493; 009-426-181-735-482; 010-187-743-570-895; 012-627-787-071-501; 013-038-761-988-056; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-804-916-995-414; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-661-112-251-592; 019-567-702-794-034; 019-615-552-886-50X; 021-693-057-817-131; 021-716-104-178-977; 023-830-496-181-623; 024-607-781-626-606; 024-905-059-802-997; 026-545-221-443-467; 026-617-630-691-234; 030-002-966-168-731; 031-219-176-520-888; 031-837-153-787-342; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-229-108-136-564; 035-143-942-540-296; 035-402-974-768-248; 037-436-823-090-386; 039-430-495-701-330; 041-323-502-321-36X; 041-744-175-231-513; 043-288-458-558-686; 048-889-201-158-674; 048-952-966-839-251; 050-789-048-535-501; 051-301-074-196-640; 055-643-503-860-593; 057-349-983-849-38X; 057-607-951-283-106; 058-085-958-165-816; 058-531-954-531-310; 060-748-407-187-900; 062-048-899-665-467; 062-214-173-891-992; 062-469-532-642-520; 064-775-370-233-852; 070-983-211-803-268; 071-511-910-396-068; 072-033-671-901-532; 074-017-562-218-104; 074-245-792-789-206; 083-238-000-384-878; 083-626-734-065-299; 093-649-747-077-058; 094-017-185-291-853; 095-171-148-054-076; 099-599-247-210-76X; 103-845-729-221-30X; 103-974-904-022-158; 104-898-249-163-45X; 114-534-933-152-285; 115-116-261-982-909; 116-953-283-915-381; 118-581-038-700-756; 122-201-974-023-37X; 133-323-798-067-270; 137-679-680-090-558; 141-573-208-820-528; 152-851-921-965-411; 155-590-493-745-223; 168-880-158-320-727; 171-491-681-744-62X,12

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that comparative judgements predict a unique percentage of job insecurity’s variance, above self esteem. Subsequently, questionnaires were applied via social media or via paper-pencil to 108 participants. Hierarchical regression results show that comparative judgements do not have any incremental effect in predicting job insecurity above self esteem. Self esteem predicts 21% variance in job insecurity. In conclusion, job insecurity is predicted by how individuals globally evaluate themselves, with comparative judgements regarding one’s own performance or the company’s performance having no incremental predictive power. These two variables can be regarded as undifferentiated from self esteem.",9,2,117,126,Stressor; Psychology; Predictive power; Financial crisis; Self-esteem; Job insecurity; Social media; Multilevel model; Social psychology,,,,,https://www.studiadoctoralia.ro/index.php/sdpsych/article/view/83 https://www.studiadoctoralia.ro/index.php/sdpsych/article/download/83/68,http://dx.doi.org/10.47040/sd/sdpsych.v9i2.83,,10.47040/sd/sdpsych.v9i2.83,3084045029,,0,002-227-687-373-793; 007-650-715-218-820; 010-232-721-840-145; 010-981-869-144-080; 012-615-896-317-939; 012-854-907-003-846; 013-493-124-036-09X; 014-015-291-938-963; 014-215-458-497-896; 014-554-619-959-964; 015-624-974-290-967; 016-214-696-775-925; 019-429-076-924-739; 020-019-286-330-078; 023-558-288-745-367; 024-669-086-846-619; 025-503-319-519-931; 027-102-069-025-781; 029-947-142-407-370; 030-972-195-025-042; 038-502-903-721-562; 042-045-859-738-116; 051-552-477-567-692; 055-822-883-232-460; 058-891-493-448-117; 063-956-106-105-022; 069-179-048-160-57X; 077-883-850-385-871; 081-215-728-904-691; 081-688-325-896-009; 083-671-739-097-719; 088-971-804-235-783; 091-888-591-238-542; 102-149-156-486-89X; 102-766-923-614-703; 107-866-925-349-552; 108-162-260-219-390; 108-380-601-439-128; 111-929-899-698-846; 112-374-545-625-287; 119-234-060-266-431; 146-951-314-180-066; 185-175-252-497-409; 186-936-946-886-724; 188-766-483-151-53X,0

Judges compare two pieces of student work and judge which of both is better regarding the competence assessed. Using these pairwise comparison data, students’ work is scaled according to its quality. Since student work is highly information loaded and heterogeneous of nature, this raises the question whether judges can handle this type of complex judgments? However, research into the complexity of comparative judgment and its relation with decision accuracy is currently lacking. Therefore, this study initiates a theoretical framework on the complexity of comparative judgment and relates it to decision accuracy. Based on this framework two hypotheses are formulated and their plausibility is examined. The first hypothesis states that the distance between two pieces of student work on the rank-order (rank-order distance) is negatively related to experienced complexity, irrespectively of decision accuracy. In contrast, hypothesis 2 expects decision accuracy to moderate the relation between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. A negative relation is expected for accurate decisions. Meanwhile, inaccurate decisions are assumed to result in higher experienced complexity than accurate decisions, irrespective of rank-order distance. In both hypotheses, judges are expected to vary in mean experienced complexity as well as in the strength of the expected relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Using an information-theoretic approach, both hypotheses are translated into a statistical model and their relative fit is assessed. All analyses are replicated on three samples. Sample 1 and 2 comprise CJ data on the assessment of writing, while sample 3 contain pairwise comparison data on the assessment of visual arts. Results unambiguously confirm the moderating role of decision accuracy (hypothesis 2). Inaccurate decisions are experienced as more complex than accurate decisions, irrespective of rank-order distance. Meanwhile, for accurate decisions, rank-order distance is negatively related to experienced complexity. In line with expectations, differences between judges are found in mean experienced complexity and in the strength of the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Suggestions for further theory development are formulated based on the results of this study.",2,,,,Competence (human resources); Statistical model; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Development theory; Cognitive psychology; Pairwise comparison,,,,Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2017.00044/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/88065514 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:187399 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2017.00044/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2017.00044/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2017.00044,,10.3389/feduc.2017.00044,2752221334,,0,007-386-871-650-113; 018-269-445-638-29X; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-980-996-015-137; 044-898-668-023-385; 044-962-236-204-557; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-091-210-665-560; 066-908-670-161-319; 085-408-776-824-254; 087-991-691-200-809; 091-666-780-893-50X; 095-590-706-989-383; 100-635-332-895-23X; 102-955-514-174-383; 121-161-560-636-803; 126-454-221-798-016; 134-232-387-715-678; 167-275-555-617-549; 167-605-230-618-112; 168-704-895-296-891,4

Holmes; Michelle Meadows; Ian Stockford; Qingping He,"The relationship of expected and actual difficulty of items on six mathematics question papers designed for 16-year olds in England was investigated through paired comparison using experts and testing with students. A variant of the Rasch model was applied to the comparison data to establish a scale of expected difficulty. In testing, the papers were taken by 2933 students using an equivalent-groups design, allowing the actual difficulty of the items to be placed on the same measurement scale. It was found that the expected difficulty derived using the comparative judgement approach and the actual difficulty derived from the test data was reasonably strongly correlated. This suggests that comparative judgement may be an effective way to investigate the comparability of difficulty of examinations. The approach could potentially be used as a proxy for pretesting high-stakes tests in situations where pretesting is not feasible due to reasons of security or other risks.",18,4,366,391,Rasch model; Proxy (climate); Test data; Cognitive psychology; Comparability; Item response theory; Judgement; Paired comparison; Evaluation methods,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1198321 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,,10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,2891521597,,0,002-124-246-117-231; 003-252-151-417-621; 003-756-524-500-524; 004-656-836-558-125; 006-459-131-027-623; 007-487-157-236-890; 008-272-852-765-741; 009-316-589-031-043; 009-668-473-434-827; 015-364-781-321-626; 016-233-940-623-506; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 023-450-650-144-536; 026-231-463-187-310; 032-888-074-486-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-218-666-884-410; 041-137-753-798-868; 046-429-021-202-877; 046-976-766-132-212; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-859-954-579-45X; 049-032-798-379-237; 051-492-788-553-405; 058-800-324-964-616; 063-863-517-456-537; 064-309-466-938-920; 066-908-670-161-319; 076-050-960-166-845; 080-973-114-262-707; 085-782-124-158-049; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-688-011-210-466; 095-560-048-909-507; 098-071-220-057-302; 131-808-466-646-551; 133-007-911-062-160; 139-442-876-580-978; 159-396-515-847-543; 164-779-008-985-991; 167-648-089-068-325; 177-832-080-912-190; 180-630-843-478-058; 192-571-358-345-962,0

Few of the currently-employed tactics are capable of simultaneously dealing with both cardinal and ordinal inconsistency issues in one model, and most are heavily dependent on the method chosen for weight (priorities) derivation or the obtained closest matrix by optimization method that may change many of the original values. In this paper, we propose a Hadamard product induced bias matrix model, which only requires the use of the data in the original matrix to identify and adjust the cardinally inconsistent element(s) in a PCM. Through graph theory and numerical examples, we show that the adapted Hadamard model is effective in identifying and eliminating the ordinal inconsistencies. Also, for the most inconsistent element identified in the matrix, we develop innovative methods to improve the consistency of a PCM. The proposed model is only dependent on the original matrix, is independent of the methods chosen to derive the priority vectors, and preserves most of the original information in matrix A since only the most inconsistent element(s) need(s) to be modified. Our method is much easier to implement than any of the existing models, and the values it recommends for replacement outperform those derived from the literature. It significantly enhances matrix consistency and improves the reliability of PCM decision making.",236,1,261,271,Algorithm; Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Decision matrix; Contradiction; Mathematics; Hadamard transform; Ordinal number; Graph theory; Hadamard product; Data consistency,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.035 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Gang_Kou/publication/260556572_Enhancing_data_consistency_in_decision_matrix_Adapting_Hadamard_model_to_mitigate_judgment_contradiction/links/00b7d5397b8cb0003b000000.pdf https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ejores:v:236:y:2014:i:1:p:261-271 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v236y2014i1p261-271.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor236.html#KouES14 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.035 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.035 http://or.nsfc.gov.cn/handle/00001903-5/352815 https://core.ac.uk/display/82587494 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221713009521 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221713009521#! https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82587494.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.035,,10.1016/j.ejor.2013.11.035,2031299513,,0,004-293-390-041-809; 010-836-835-875-247; 011-413-419-355-412; 015-050-303-686-75X; 016-800-138-904-405; 019-929-222-365-439; 025-192-553-715-150; 026-358-629-546-378; 028-417-432-189-514; 029-619-667-483-138; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-581-610-717-836; 046-455-923-650-125; 054-219-490-889-557; 063-787-171-810-233; 067-431-637-655-975; 068-097-817-047-550; 068-133-038-272-957; 068-354-110-620-186; 071-753-769-302-254; 073-530-973-496-732; 073-780-989-068-881; 076-710-417-981-320; 078-500-602-804-841; 078-656-199-314-113; 084-734-387-214-396; 092-561-349-524-139; 096-834-810-794-96X; 096-851-238-164-477; 103-023-221-405-324; 112-304-417-559-285; 120-686-333-569-167; 124-606-723-982-996; 126-952-357-294-644; 129-012-558-738-829; 139-005-791-627-161; 140-831-276-782-917; 155-141-751-338-53X; 162-700-612-333-263; 165-596-178-769-700,279

Radzevick; Don A. Moore,"Three studies investigate the psychology of comparative judgment, examining the circumstances under which judgments tend to concentrate disproportionately on one of the two elements that underlie the comparison (i.e., focused comparisons). We examine these tendencies at the judgment formation and information retrieval stages by examining judgment content as well as the speed and efficiency with which people make comparisons. The results replicate prior findings of differential weighting, indicating that focusing occurs in the formation stage of comparative judgments. However, focusing is absent in the reaction time data, suggesting that both elements of the comparison are equally accessible when individuals retrieve comparison-relevant information. These findings clarify the process by which people arrive at comparative judgments and demonstrate precisely when focused comparisons occur.",122,1,80,91,Psychology; Social comparison theory; Weighting; Replicate; Time data; Social psychology,,,,,https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jobhdp:v:122:y:2013:i:1:p:80-91 http://learnmoore.org/papers/Radzevick%20Moore%202013.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597813000551 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=4774459 https://cupola.gettysburg.edu/mgmtfac/15/ https://core.ac.uk/display/148918973 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jobhdp/v122y2013i1p80-91.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.05.001,,10.1016/j.obhdp.2013.05.001,1987642365,,0,003-258-105-238-013; 005-105-404-496-456; 005-430-484-925-298; 007-235-613-104-859; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-476-553-649-690; 014-419-216-898-317; 015-538-931-377-252; 019-415-581-803-244; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-296-560-253-063; 023-202-665-891-558; 030-850-760-426-290; 032-104-735-088-638; 037-521-354-487-685; 043-042-734-594-449; 046-352-600-258-872; 050-940-770-464-121; 054-748-247-945-380; 056-152-371-973-827; 056-511-091-557-150; 061-142-370-003-855; 061-748-308-588-588; 065-025-073-410-553; 066-922-859-214-884; 071-187-504-333-895; 073-663-750-011-207; 080-352-765-956-858; 081-476-781-835-336; 082-662-120-833-072; 085-535-622-458-150; 090-023-370-872-145; 102-006-703-875-491; 102-795-542-679-792; 108-227-936-150-296; 110-167-195-442-258; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-274-486-110-685; 116-762-136-028-844; 119-647-878-140-945; 124-656-535-257-223; 157-705-653-746-365; 170-158-318-409-40X; 187-298-198-255-232,4

Robertson; Nole M. Hiebert; Ken N. Seergobin; Adrian M. Owen; Penny A. MacDonald,"Abstract Objective Whether the dorsal striatum (DS) mediates cognitive control or cognitive effort per se in decision-making is unclear given that these effects are highly correlated. As the cognitive control requirements of a neuropsychological task intensify, cognitive effort increases proportionately. We implemented a task that disentangled cognitive control and cognitive effort to specify the particular function DS mediates in decision-making. Methods Sixteen healthy young adults completed a number Stroop task with simultaneous blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response (BOLD) measurement using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Participants selected the physically larger number of a pair of single-digit integers. Discriminating smaller versus larger physical size differences between a number pair requires greater cognitive effort, but does not require greater cognitive control. We also investigated the effect of conflict between the physical and numerical dimensions of targets (e.g., 2 6). Selections in this incongruent case are more cognitively effortful and require greater cognitive control to suppress responding to the irrelevant dimension. Enhancing cognitive effort or cognitive control demands increases errors and response times. Despite similar behavioural profiles, our aim was to determine whether DS mediates cognitive control or simply indexes cognitive effort, using the same data set. Results As expected, behavioural interference effects occurred for both enhanced cognitive control and/or cognitive effort conditions. Despite similar degrees of behavioural interference, DS BOLD signal only correlated with interference arising due to increased cognitive control demands in the incongruent case. DS was not preferentially activated for discriminations of smaller relative to larger physical size differences between number pairs, even when using liberal statistical criteria. However, our incongruent and physical size effects conjointly activated regions related to effortful processing (e.g., anterior cingulate cortex). Interpretation We interpret these findings as support for the increasingly accepted notion that DS mediates cognitive control specifically and does not simply index cognitive effort per se.",114,,170,184,Dorsum; Neuropsychology; Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Anterior cingulate cortex; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Striatum; Cognitive effort,Cognitive control; Cognitive effort; Striatum; Stroop; fMRI,Adult; Brain Mapping; Cognition/physiology; Decision Making/physiology; Executive Function/physiology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neostriatum/physiology; Reaction Time; Stroop Test; Young Adult,,Canada Excellence Research Chair; Academic Medical Organization of Southwestern Ontario,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915002785 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage114.html#RobertsonHSOM15 https://core.ac.uk/display/82744706 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811915002785 https://www.owenlab.uwo.ca/pdf/2015%20-%20Robertson%20-%20NeuroImage%20.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25862263 https://www.uwo.ca/bmi/owenlab/pdf/2015%20-%20Robertson%20-%20NeuroImage%20.pdf https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.082 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82744706.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.082,25862263,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2015.03.082,2082499495,,0,000-111-739-877-313; 000-449-293-458-111; 003-378-374-817-343; 004-194-402-259-052; 006-279-955-801-775; 007-704-724-962-150; 008-598-673-908-321; 010-589-190-241-312; 010-976-147-863-749; 011-546-216-538-621; 012-567-334-715-747; 013-070-645-548-109; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-182-362-511-84X; 016-513-033-888-734; 017-143-142-263-507; 017-683-258-166-669; 019-198-395-259-670; 019-403-434-188-319; 024-452-317-180-82X; 025-907-321-316-616; 026-065-294-652-814; 027-292-904-575-606; 028-863-700-045-34X; 030-590-707-687-952; 030-684-419-820-365; 031-553-378-816-605; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-458-736-996-230; 032-635-789-049-979; 033-039-347-567-168; 033-366-922-283-048; 033-404-124-342-992; 033-951-100-656-615; 034-177-259-508-856; 034-435-245-571-60X; 035-221-235-264-633; 035-704-650-118-461; 037-120-554-968-320; 038-294-170-786-890; 038-714-940-340-464; 040-296-534-636-596; 041-584-712-400-221; 042-004-481-645-418; 042-611-644-613-977; 043-246-324-664-066; 043-255-320-121-974; 044-698-914-247-389; 046-431-256-693-714; 047-699-300-246-908; 048-123-572-483-987; 051-472-129-782-759; 051-951-753-022-639; 053-325-138-098-695; 053-919-123-135-519; 056-747-488-536-05X; 057-039-704-422-559; 058-831-142-296-102; 059-127-683-870-012; 060-748-407-187-900; 061-266-607-128-096; 061-898-072-010-678; 063-427-001-271-135; 066-451-801-924-025; 066-897-609-774-174; 068-659-911-394-294; 070-597-179-995-654; 070-875-072-615-372; 078-901-611-188-953; 080-398-235-691-622; 080-634-795-139-07X; 084-795-097-867-996; 088-456-045-689-55X; 094-072-746-373-077; 094-894-096-019-545; 097-812-521-651-937; 097-816-501-802-054; 104-898-249-163-45X; 107-461-210-219-134; 108-326-202-322-451; 113-875-496-607-390; 116-697-773-136-399; 117-324-638-338-136; 117-412-958-132-575; 128-315-235-773-883; 133-181-801-729-976,31

Method We examined (a) how these drivers assess their risk of sanctions and their risk of causing an automobile crash because of speeding in comparison to the estimated risks of other drivers, and (b) how realistic their comparative risk judgments are. We measured the relationship between the drivers' comparative risk judgments, self-reported speeding, and driving-related sensation-seeking. We hypothesized that (a) they would think they have less risk of sanctions and of causing a car accident than others, and (b) their comparative judgments of speeding risks would be linked to self-reported speeding and driving-related sensation-seeking. The study was based on a computerized questionnaire survey conducted with 3,002 young drivers (mean age = 22.3) administered by professional investigators.

Usually, EIA involves a lot of qualitative and quantitative criteria. Data envelopment analysis (DEA), an effective method that is used to rank and select the best alternative from a set of alternatives, is not tailored to address qualitative criteria, thus rendering the application to multiple criteria problems not amenable. This paper presents a new methodology of multiple criteria data envelopment analysis (MCDEA), which can address both qualitative and quantitative criteria. MCDEA is divided into two stages for fully ranking units and each unit has multiple inputs and outputs.

In social Internet of Things network, crowdsourcing that collects the intelligence of the human crowd has served as a powerful tool for data acquisition and distributed computing. To support critical applications (e.g., a recommendation system and assessing the inequality of urban perception), in this article, we shall focus on the collaborative ranking problems for user preference prediction from crowdsourced pairwise comparisons. Based on the Bradley--Terry--Luce (BTL) model, a maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) is proposed via low-rank approach in order to estimate the underlying weight/score matrix, thereby predicting the ranking list for each user. A novel regularized formulation with the smoothed surrogate of elementwise infinity norm is proposed in order to address the unique challenge of the coupled the non-smooth elementwise infinity norm constraint and non-convex low-rank constraint in the MLE problem. We solve the resulting smoothed rank-constrained optimization problem via developing the Riemannian trust-region algorithm on quotient manifolds of fixed-rank matrices, which enjoys the superlinear convergence rate. The admirable performance and algorithmic advantages of the proposed method over the state-of-the-art algorithms are demonstrated via numerical results. Moreover, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on large collaborative filtering datasets in both success rate of inferring preference and normalized discounted cumulative gain.",14,2,1,26,Optimization problem; Uniform norm; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Collaborative filtering; Computer science; Recommender system; Crowdsourcing; Social computing; Theoretical computer science,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/tkdd/tkdd14.html#DongYS20 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3372407 https://kms.shanghaitech.edu.cn/handle/2MSLDSTB/120821?mode=full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3372407,,10.1145/3372407,3027047177,,0,001-631-224-533-795; 002-095-167-597-222; 002-626-419-212-422; 004-914-828-162-488; 012-596-707-828-262; 013-187-848-352-295; 015-477-122-910-604; 028-425-889-836-865; 028-522-136-040-47X; 029-818-100-375-736; 037-227-920-279-737; 050-379-643-846-097; 055-793-187-478-627; 057-546-501-967-993; 061-198-954-086-060; 068-101-414-213-728; 071-264-929-566-076; 074-307-907-814-119; 081-697-399-196-317; 092-058-974-172-011; 101-563-802-735-991; 101-952-217-841-223; 115-582-515-756-396; 144-607-646-779-766; 148-128-226-546-082; 156-847-483-746-238; 160-054-264-809-301; 173-373-811-316-902,0
075-326-659-540-162,Distinguishing Lay from Expert Opinion: The Need to Focus on the Epistemological Differences between the Reasoning Processes Used by Lay and Expert Witnesses,,2014,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Edward J. Imwinkelried,"Justice Holmes once remarked that the law is constantly drawing lines. That remark certainly holds true in Evidence law. On a daily basis trial judges must distinguish between character and noncharacter uses of evidence and differentiate hearsay from nonhearsay theories of logical relevance. The topic of the enclosed article is another evidentiary distinction: that between lay opinions and expert opinions. That distinction has assumed tremendous importance since 1993. In that year, Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 was amended to prescribe mandatory pre-discovery disclosures. One of the most important parts of that scheme is a mandate that the proponent of a testifying expert provide the opposition with a detailed report previewing the expert’s opinion. Federal Rule of Criminal Procedure 16 imposes a similar requirement for an expert report. However, there is no requirement under either rule for such a report when the opinion is lay in nature. In the same year, the Supreme Court handed down its celebrated decision in Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993). Daubert announced a new empirical validation test for the admissibility of scientific testimony. In 1999 in Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999), the Court expanded Daubert and held that the proponent of any type of expert testimony must establish objective indicia of the reliability of the testimony. Like the Civil Rule 26 and Criminal Rule 16 amendments, Daubert and Kumho are inapplicable to lay opinion testimony. These two 1993 developments have created a strong incentive for litigants to characterize their witnesses’ opinions as lay rather than expert. If the judge accepts that characterization, there is no need for the litigant to file a Rule 26 report or lay a Daubert foundation. Unfortunately, as Part I of the enclosed article points out, the courts are experiencing difficulty drawing the line between lay and expert opinions. Part I considers several possible bases for distinguishing the two types of opinions that have been proposed in the past. Part I demonstrates that each of those potential bases is unsatisfactory. Part II argues that in order to properly differentiate between the two types of opinions, the court should focus on the underlying reasoning processes. The essential insight is that in both cases, the witness makes a comparative judgment, comparing a generalization to the case-specific fact or facts being evaluated. However, there are fundamental differences between the reasoning processes employed by lay and expert witnesses. In the case of lay opinions, the witness: derives his or her generalization primarily from personal experience; and must rely on firsthand knowledge to acquire his or her information about the case-specific fact or facts. In sharp contrast, in the case of expert opinions, the witness: may draw on hearsay sources such as lectures and professional literature to derive his or her generalization; and under Federal Rule of Evidence 703, may rely on hypothetical questions and secondhand reports as well as personal knowledge as methods of obtaining information about the case-specific fact or facts. Part III of the article explains how the courts may use the insights discussed in Part II to both differentiate between the two types of opinion and determine the admissibility of such opinions. To illustrate the utility of this approach, Part III discusses one of the modern battlegrounds, that is, police officers’ testimony about alleged code words used by drug traffickers. In many cases, prosecutors have argued that the testimony is mere lay opinion testimony, eliminating the need for either a pretrial expert report or a Daubert foundation at trial. Although the courts have struggled to draw the line in these cases, Part III demonstrates that the courts can draw the line with confidence by employing the analysis proposed in Part II.",,,,,Political science; Law; Opposition (planets); Witness; Supreme court; Hearsay; Expert report; Criminal procedure; Civil procedure; Personal knowledge base,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2465228_code366600.pdf?abstractid=2465228&mirid=1&type=2 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2465228 https://ssrn.com/abstract=2465228,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2465228,,10.2139/ssrn.2465228,143873023,,0,004-320-707-620-165; 016-144-104-484-593; 072-228-025-833-133; 165-200-134-005-617,0

Shah; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Adityanand Guntuboyina; Martin J. Wainwright,"There are various parametric models for analyzing pairwise comparison data, including the Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, but their reliance on strong parametric assumptions is limiting. In this paper, we study a flexible model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes parametric models, including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated at the same rate as in standard parametric models up to logarithmic terms. On the other hand, unlike in the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the minimax-optimal estimator in the stochastically transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations.",63,2,934,959,Parametric statistics; Minimax; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Transitive relation; Parametric model; Applied mathematics; Computer science; Stochastic process,,,,Air Force Office of Scientific Research; National Science Foundation; Microsoft Research; ONR-MURI; ONR MURI,https://doi.org/10.1109/TIT.2016.2634418 https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/TIT.2016.2634418 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1510.html#ShahBGW15 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv151005610S/abstract https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7763782/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/tit.2016.2634418,,10.1109/tit.2016.2634418,2963611811,,0,016-138-352-817-050; 018-269-445-638-29X; 025-009-658-071-875; 027-896-243-015-499; 032-718-506-620-930; 033-452-006-171-017; 033-920-290-313-776; 034-901-673-085-689; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-829-579-281-766; 039-678-937-755-408; 045-885-584-509-736; 045-893-062-802-310; 047-164-545-895-518; 050-943-988-713-681; 058-464-008-672-662; 065-267-831-248-009; 065-524-837-869-927; 067-860-359-894-241; 070-331-031-103-877; 075-208-362-608-800; 078-900-794-277-670; 081-918-625-564-744; 083-231-400-366-060; 085-982-503-333-800; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-081-068-281-719; 088-185-235-230-617; 090-675-229-255-539; 092-474-419-202-077; 096-979-791-156-213; 097-492-503-037-095; 103-111-574-598-758; 105-197-803-566-972; 137-940-671-974-155; 147-543-426-548-72X; 147-790-916-717-782; 152-625-606-175-254; 152-760-702-983-990; 155-729-366-689-349; 161-247-307-055-667; 189-745-424-791-442; 195-685-864-553-865,43

Tennessee (1991) and Furman v. Georgia (1972) was that VIS might enable jurors to make comparative judgments about the worth of the victim. This study examined the effect VIS and low and middle socioeconomic status (SES) victims have on jurors' decisions. Mock jurors listened to 1 of 3 audio recordings of the sentencing phase of a capital murder trial (no VIS, low SES VIS, or middle SES VIS) and were asked to sentence the defendant to either life in prison without parole or death. Results indicated VIS themselves did not significantly affect mock jurors' sentencing decisions. However, mock jurors who heard the middle SES victim VIS were significantly more likely to sentence the defendant to death compared to those who heard the low SES victim VIS. The results suggest that the concerns of the Supreme Court were valid. Mock jurors were impacted by SES information in the VIS and were more punitive toward the defendant when he killed a higher rather than a lower SES person.",32,3,521,532,Life imprisonment; Social class; Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Sentence; Supreme court; Poison control; Social psychology; Punitive damages,,Crime Victims; Criminal Law/legislation & jurisprudence; Decision Making; Female; Homicide/legislation & jurisprudence; Humans; Judgment; Male; Prejudice; Social Class; Social Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28516855,http://dx.doi.org/10.1891/0886-6708.vv-d-15-00187,28516855,10.1891/0886-6708.vv-d-15-00187,2616061573,,0,005-434-617-422-896; 013-879-560-031-326; 014-179-574-201-284; 033-381-615-592-153; 043-310-421-603-568; 048-526-715-292-632; 059-625-813-201-266; 064-613-756-602-110; 071-953-130-149-814; 073-045-713-136-846; 076-596-946-305-604; 125-915-578-112-956; 141-665-558-155-132; 180-142-188-987-063,4
075-679-261-715-018,Unrealistic Optimism: East and West?,2013-02-13,2013,journal article,Frontiers in psychology,16641078,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Mary Sissons Joshi; Wakefield Carter,"Following Weinstein’s pioneering work (1980) many studies established that people have an optimistic bias concerning future life events. At first, the bulk of research was conducted using populations in North America and Northern Europe, the optimistic bias was thought of as universal, and little attention was paid to cultural context. However, construing unrealistic optimism as a form of self-enhancement, some researchers noted that it was far less common in East Asian cultures. The current study extends enquiry to a different non-Western culture. Two hundred and eighty seven middle aged and middle-income participants (200 in India, 87 in England) rated 11 positive and 11 negative events in terms of the chances of each event occurring in “their own life”, and the chances of each event occurring in the lives of “people like them”. Comparative optimism was shown for bad events, with Indian participants showing higher levels of optimism than English participants. The position regarding comparative optimism for good events was more complex. In India those of higher socioeconomic status were optimistic, while those of lower socioeconomic status were on average pessimistic. Overall, English participants showed neither optimism nor pessimism for good events. The results, whose clinical relevance is discussed, suggest that the expression of unrealistic optimism is moulded by an interplay of culture and socioeconomic circumstance.",4,6,6,6,Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Optimism; Self-enhancement; Cultural context; Life events; Western culture; East Asia; Social psychology; Pessimism,England; India; culture; self-enhancement; unrealistic optimism,,,,https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/items/6bdfbc56-91f7-2c78-d1ac-9e8c72a00e62/1/ https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00006/full https://radar.brookes.ac.uk/radar/file/6bdfbc56-91f7-2c78-d1ac-9e8c72a00e62/1/joshi2013unrealistic.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3570981/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3570981/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00006/abstract https://doaj.org/article/ef6fdfa2dbf842919a22e5b79c47de32 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00006/pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/JOSUOE https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82842080.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00006,23407689,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00006,2158603910,PMC3570981,0,000-152-770-951-500; 000-750-528-134-465; 000-808-649-752-242; 001-282-268-779-612; 002-335-526-432-404; 002-597-966-013-414; 003-620-584-980-643; 003-772-594-918-248; 004-931-001-732-731; 008-582-201-861-135; 008-599-409-303-811; 010-362-534-627-74X; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-806-387-527-450; 014-419-216-898-317; 016-327-070-586-525; 018-757-245-440-011; 018-797-159-529-542; 020-419-379-272-121; 026-188-326-311-687; 027-696-956-867-994; 031-426-098-347-97X; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-773-740-377-897; 033-221-774-639-665; 035-466-534-087-345; 036-036-913-273-363; 038-108-396-640-841; 038-858-881-186-93X; 039-457-113-444-712; 042-507-260-411-102; 043-878-816-276-524; 045-132-526-108-153; 047-238-944-148-981; 050-276-976-022-713; 050-443-987-716-871; 051-316-474-596-055; 051-682-269-958-344; 052-468-831-021-946; 054-938-948-057-770; 055-698-285-826-896; 057-767-363-689-487; 057-900-667-227-636; 058-556-476-472-029; 058-902-141-510-184; 059-160-567-507-640; 062-525-372-039-995; 063-303-749-209-96X; 071-058-447-775-222; 071-849-452-044-150; 072-627-007-404-35X; 075-192-873-895-254; 080-238-595-342-263; 082-246-230-644-35X; 083-799-756-108-961; 085-467-253-372-236; 086-630-335-134-411; 086-919-693-685-608; 092-999-657-485-983; 095-569-072-288-027; 096-927-155-976-718; 097-366-488-059-538; 100-720-713-390-995; 102-773-455-795-990; 103-354-913-909-511; 107-854-421-865-889; 109-484-234-672-691; 118-616-782-495-604; 118-952-603-519-168; 124-243-117-978-815; 126-365-024-459-846; 130-857-978-762-075; 131-803-806-675-541; 131-953-914-104-707; 132-396-553-075-302; 134-549-916-860-252; 136-127-444-115-061; 136-955-095-033-255; 140-272-240-838-546; 148-199-571-001-356; 155-494-058-045-652; 170-800-981-851-021; 171-430-553-845-718; 171-496-654-854-105; 179-615-961-217-819; 188-541-957-285-517; 197-151-224-677-129,20

Sometimes, these criteria are also illustrated with examples of varying quality. It is, however, not yet clear how students learn from shared criteria and examples. This research aims to investigate the learning effects of two different instructional approaches: applying criteria to examples and comparative judgment. International business students were instructed to write a five-paragraph essay, preceded by a 30-minutes peer assessment in which they evaluated the quality of a range of example essays. Half of the students evaluated the quality of the example essays using a list of teacher-designed criteria (criteria condition; n = 20), the other group evaluated by pairwise comparisons (comparative judgment condition; n = 20). Students were also requested to provide peer feedback. Results show that the instructional approach influenced the kind of aspects students commented on when giving feedback. Students in the comparative judgment condition provided relatively more feedback on higher order aspects such as the content and structure of the text than students in the criteria condition. This was only the case for improvement feedback; for feedback on strengths there were no significant differences. Positive effects of comparative judgment on students’ own writing performance were only moderate and non-significant in this small sample. Although the transfer effects were inconclusive, this study nevertheless shows that comparative judgment can be as powerful as applying criteria to examples. Comparative judgement inherently activates students to engage with exemplars at a higher textual level and enables students to evaluate more example essays by comparison than by criteria. Further research is needed on the long-term and indirect effects of comparative judgment, as it might influence students’ conceptualization of writing, without directly improving their writing performance.",3,,1,12,Learning effect; Higher education; Mathematics education; Psychology; Pairwise comparison; International business; Judgement; Peer feedback; Peer assessment; Conceptualization,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/applying-criteria-to-examples-or-learning-by-comparison-effects-o https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086/full https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F34bf345d-5323-4288-832a-f76368337787 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086,,10.3389/feduc.2018.00086,2897965084,,0,000-541-169-360-063; 001-833-620-542-031; 007-787-338-181-694; 009-111-724-205-749; 009-631-573-859-890; 010-705-107-103-839; 013-366-379-871-159; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-354-004-761-571; 019-103-887-475-092; 022-445-591-735-121; 027-929-273-054-526; 032-327-336-882-576; 035-262-149-415-846; 035-966-099-589-64X; 040-971-330-680-09X; 041-533-041-196-02X; 043-128-207-906-620; 044-162-761-248-982; 046-154-535-777-571; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-151-229-726-003; 051-876-238-561-753; 057-487-318-922-175; 066-282-838-915-419; 069-107-065-440-634; 072-639-263-099-663; 081-216-031-693-913; 082-101-427-004-332; 084-473-726-538-190; 105-060-972-080-52X; 105-862-038-017-905; 109-350-109-491-919; 112-619-585-716-733; 117-430-862-104-149; 144-247-536-712-847; 149-208-961-050-864; 165-708-633-922-222; 179-937-702-643-938; 183-657-441-981-020,6

This article examines the work of several prominent comparative musicologists by focusing on one key issue: accurately determining the playback speed which most appropriately matches that used at the time of the original field recording.

Each of the three wrongs discussed in earlier chapters—unfair subordination, infringements of a right to deliberative freedom, and denials of basic goods—is a way of failing to treat someone as an equal. But each gives us a different way of understanding what it means to fail to treat someone as an equal. In this Chapter, the author also considers the relationship between these three ways of failing to treat someone as an equal. The author also argues that each, on its own, is sufficient to render discrimination wrongful; although most cases of wrongful discrimination will be wrong for more than one reason. Finally, the author presents a number of advantages of this pluralist theory, explaining how it helps us to resolve puzzles about whether discrimination wrongs individuals or groups, and about the kinds of comparative judgments that we need to when assessing whether a particular discriminatory practice wrongs people.</p>",,,153,182,Positive economics; Economics; Pluralism (political theory); Inequality,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190927301.003.0005,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/oso/9780190927301.003.0005,,10.1093/oso/9780190927301.003.0005,3027052606,,0,,0

Brunec; Vincent Walsh; William D. Penny; Hugo J. Spiers,"Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) is a non-invasive brain stimulation method with many putative applications and reported to effectively modulate behaviour. However, its effects have yet to be considered at a computational level. To address this we modelled the tuning curves underlying the behavioural effects of stimulation in a perceptual task. Participants judged which of the two serially presented images contained more items (numerosity judgement task) or was presented longer (duration judgement task). During presentation of the second image their posterior parietal cortices (PPCs) were stimulated bilaterally with opposite polarities for 1.6 s. We also examined the impact of three stimulation conditions on behaviour: anodal right-PPC and cathodal left-PPC (rA-lC), reverse order (lA-rC) and no-stimulation condition. Behavioural results showed that participants were more accurate in numerosity and duration judgement tasks when they were stimulated with lA-rC and rA-lC stimulation conditions respectively. Simultaneously, a decrease in performance on numerosity and duration judgement tasks was observed when the stimulation condition favoured the other task. Thus, our results revealed a double-dissociation of laterality and task. Importantly, we were able to model the effects of stimulation on behaviour. Our computational modelling showed that participants' superior performance was attributable to a narrower tuning curve — smaller standard deviation of detection noise. We believe that this approach may prove useful in understanding the impact of brain stimulation on other cognitive domains.",102,,451,457,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Neuroscience; Laterality; Time perception; Electrical brain stimulation; Stimulation; Transcranial direct-current stimulation; Neuronal tuning; Brain stimulation,,,,Wellcome Trust,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914006776 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25130301 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/64570/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4229383 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1443110/ https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.016 http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~wpenny/publications/javadi14.pdf https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/1443110/1/1-s2.0-S1053811914006776-main.pdf https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/1311234 https://core.ac.uk/display/30711584 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/52602/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914006776 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage102.html#JavadiBWPS14 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81201726.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.016,,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.08.016,2130984193,,0,002-715-178-012-001; 003-198-583-089-698; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-917-539-894-873; 007-005-255-545-094; 010-417-380-446-801; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-002-921-415-015; 013-873-132-134-17X; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-821-170-460-739; 021-079-731-837-469; 021-104-327-601-907; 021-693-057-817-131; 021-827-171-250-889; 023-121-728-277-869; 027-463-031-417-329; 031-316-795-276-233; 031-324-485-402-628; 035-402-974-768-248; 035-526-809-300-697; 038-222-037-852-307; 043-524-921-620-579; 044-024-195-648-096; 046-178-671-306-009; 047-463-511-810-424; 054-472-453-714-976; 062-545-032-522-444; 062-738-367-496-162; 063-050-515-629-176; 066-608-905-207-154; 070-983-211-803-268; 074-398-708-412-842; 076-878-406-712-298; 082-636-988-384-700; 087-077-553-083-806; 089-548-003-191-387; 093-099-034-997-133; 096-922-372-028-180; 102-015-082-723-499; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-673-210-798-923; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-228-591-886-001; 122-238-284-883-363; 152-851-921-965-411; 179-895-742-083-274; 199-055-961-488-187,16

Bradley; Abhay Parekh; Kannan Ramchandran; Martin J. Wainwright,"Data in the form of pairwise comparisons arises in many domains, including preference elicitation, sporting competitions, and peer grading among others. We consider parametric ordinal models for such pairwise comparison data involving a latent vector $w^* \in \mathbb{R}^d$ that represents the ""qualities"" of the $d$ items being compared; this class of models includes the two most widely used parametric models--the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and the Thurstone models. Working within a standard minimax framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal error in estimating the quality score vector $w^*$ under this class of models. The bounds depend on the topology of the comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared via its Laplacian spectrum. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen, our results provide principled guidelines for making this choice. Finally, we compare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement models and show that the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal settings have identical scalings apart from constant pre-factors.",,,,,Parametric statistics; Topology; Minimax; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Preference elicitation; Quality Score; Computer science; Upper and lower bounds; Ordinal number,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01462 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01462.pdf http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1505.01462 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01462 https://128.84.21.199/abs/1505.01462,https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01462,,,2951836260,,0,000-652-203-673-023; 004-269-574-716-057; 005-276-189-163-574; 007-417-885-892-956; 013-770-460-061-385; 017-422-516-426-553; 021-304-036-982-259; 021-526-803-476-474; 023-436-952-259-389; 023-478-492-046-416; 028-900-912-419-323; 029-480-818-954-512; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-867-159-731-756; 036-474-044-572-635; 036-734-271-423-953; 045-671-292-372-287; 048-167-285-948-942; 050-943-988-713-681; 059-974-800-186-525; 065-524-837-869-927; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-664-598-856-515; 076-050-960-166-845; 077-685-278-656-310; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-912-834-943-633; 105-197-803-566-972; 106-261-546-582-460; 107-790-959-417-375; 113-079-030-498-041; 124-171-041-782-890; 141-738-960-256-040; 152-760-702-983-990; 161-247-307-055-667; 172-137-286-231-28X; 187-350-157-372-059; 196-686-533-213-568,3

The water supply sources available in Benin are Rainfall, Ground Water, Surface Water and Storm Water Runoff. In order to compare characteristics and rank the four major water supply source, expert advice was solicited, structured questionnaires administered, and a set of criterions was derived that would be used in evaluation procedure. The following set of criterions was adopted: Cost, Availability, Ease of distribution, Accessibility, Sustainability, Quality. In analysing the pairwise comparative judgments in this study, Ground Water was the most important alternative as it had the highest score of 0.4130 in the computation of the weighted average, making Ground Water the best water supply source for Benin City.</jats:p>",1,1,169,176,Multi criteria decision; Benin city; Computer science; Operations research; Analytic hierarchy process; Water supply,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.36263/nijest.2017.01.0005,http://dx.doi.org/10.36263/nijest.2017.01.0005,,10.36263/nijest.2017.01.0005,2969445354,,0,080-584-882-489-243; 089-818-536-751-356; 101-552-389-208-130,1

The fundamental assumption of this new interpretation is that in comparative judgments (”the object X in comparison with the object Y” type) the target is contrasted with the comparison standard when the compared objects seem generally dissimilar and assimilated to the standard when the objects seem generally similar. In a series of three studies students were asked to compare the chances of certain events occurring to two objects (self vs. classmate vs. the average person). The direction of comparison was manipulated. Generally, when the more salient object was compared to the less salient object, irrespective of the valence of the events, the overestimation effects occurred only in case of frequent events and the underestimation effects only in case of rare events. The reversal of direction of comparisons yielded the clear reduction of comparative bias.",39,4,217,225,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Rare events; Salient objects; Comparison standard; Normal people; Assimilation (phonology),,,,,https://www.degruyter.com/view/j/ppb.2008.39.issue-4/v10059-008-0027-2/v10059-008-0027-2.xml http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.cejsh-article-doi-10-2478-v10059-008-0027-2 https://philarchive.org/rec/DEZTUA https://philpapers.org/rec/DEZTUA,http://dx.doi.org/10.2478/v10059-008-0027-2,,10.2478/v10059-008-0027-2,2104022071,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 001-767-031-026-722; 003-498-762-032-886; 005-485-876-843-169; 009-648-224-357-658; 012-419-306-168-454; 020-696-840-914-301; 022-940-056-786-160; 029-091-639-120-134; 032-104-735-088-638; 054-748-247-945-380; 064-990-488-097-173; 066-362-433-635-072; 072-510-801-907-465; 082-662-120-833-072; 090-023-370-872-145; 107-854-421-865-889; 114-590-207-496-477; 119-647-878-140-945; 124-656-535-257-223; 143-285-698-170-244; 163-569-396-472-394; 181-166-614-027-51X,1

Longo,"Perceiving the external spatial location of touch requires that tactile information about the stimulus location on the skin be integrated with proprioceptive information about the location of the body in external space, a process called tactile spatial remapping. Recent results have suggested that this process relies on a distorted representation of the hand. Here, I investigated whether similar distortions are also found on the forearm and how they are affected by the presence of the wrist joint, which forms a categorical, segmental boundary between the hand and the arm. Participants used a baton to judge the perceived location of touches applied to their left hand or forearm. Similar distortions were apparent on both body parts, with overestimation of distances in the medio-lateral axis compared to the proximo-distal axis. There was no perceptual expansion of distances that crossed the wrist boundary. However, there was increased overestimation of distances near the wrist in the medio-lateral orientation. These results replicate recent findings of a distorted representation of the hand underlying tactile spatial remapping, and show that this effect is not idiosyncratic to the hand, but also affects the forearm. These distortions may be a general characteristic of the mental representation of the arms.",11,,111,,Stimulus (physiology); Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Proprioception; Perception; Wrist; Forearm; Body Representation; Computer vision; Categorical variable; Mental representation,body image; body representation; position sense; proprioception; tactile spatial remapping; touch,,,European Research Council,http://eprints.bbk.ac.uk/18210/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28326030 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00111/pdf http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00111/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00111/full https://core.ac.uk/display/78918128 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82847239.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2017.00111,28326030,10.3389/fnhum.2017.00111,2594362525,PMC5339231,0,000-559-070-272-819; 001-880-466-232-255; 003-332-372-227-83X; 005-532-345-286-825; 006-156-813-617-374; 006-504-957-874-765; 007-136-808-798-439; 008-418-749-526-872; 008-762-364-812-061; 008-941-084-447-649; 009-364-910-320-420; 011-218-091-815-88X; 011-352-575-618-935; 012-426-066-780-155; 012-947-062-342-784; 014-074-668-841-855; 014-645-923-864-998; 015-560-665-221-108; 016-969-649-887-647; 019-743-712-797-36X; 020-295-496-999-344; 022-375-708-125-757; 022-745-497-339-143; 024-275-468-342-73X; 024-490-106-412-480; 025-377-907-549-796; 026-267-695-653-063; 029-816-330-213-231; 030-346-709-283-375; 030-914-096-612-57X; 031-672-230-287-067; 034-396-569-362-020; 036-316-179-422-163; 036-752-330-111-888; 038-338-220-279-785; 039-497-961-644-465; 041-978-119-761-642; 044-345-736-076-199; 046-763-055-953-437; 046-961-222-613-753; 048-563-233-110-608; 051-800-139-460-809; 054-485-710-663-886; 056-248-340-067-035; 061-094-277-673-578; 064-082-162-460-936; 064-343-255-411-300; 066-608-905-207-154; 068-686-681-242-503; 071-253-013-130-412; 071-703-919-916-206; 072-688-835-659-082; 077-361-873-419-837; 077-626-768-988-30X; 082-348-020-812-463; 085-712-434-028-238; 088-792-008-214-70X; 093-487-166-152-17X; 098-439-592-771-323; 113-374-674-178-141; 119-603-771-925-131; 121-517-696-063-834; 123-130-624-466-526; 127-103-745-229-406; 127-142-330-335-225; 130-055-311-940-035; 141-849-146-539-769; 151-494-162-718-970; 154-532-265-733-798; 166-508-599-665-452; 178-041-952-329-417,11

Garland; L.A. Modlin; F. Joseph McClernon,"Mindfulness meditation involves attending to emotions without cognitive fixation of emotional experience. Over time, this practice is held to promote alterations in trait affectivity and attentional control with resultant effects on well-being and cognition. However, relatively little is known regarding the neural substrates of meditation effects on emotion and cognition. The present study investigated the neurocognitive correlates of emotion interference on cognition in Yoga practitioners and a matched control group underwent fMRI while performing an event-related affective Stroop task. The task includes image viewing trials and Stroop trials bracketed by neutral or negative emotional distractors. During image viewing trials, Yoga practitioners exhibited less reactivity in right dlPFC to negative as compared to neutral images; whereas the control group had the opposite pattern. A main effect of valence (negative > neutral) was observed in limbic regions (e.g. amygdala), of which the magnitude was inversely related to dlPFC activation. Exploratory analyses revealed that the magnitude of amygdala activation predicted decreased self-reported positive affect in the Control group, but not among Yoga practitioners. During Stroop trials, Yoga practitioners had greater activation in vlPFC during Stroop trials when negative, compared to neutral, emotional distractor were presented; the control group exhibited the opposite pattern. Taken together, these data suggest that though Yoga practitioners exhibit limbic reactivity to negative emotional stimuli, such reactivity does not have downstream effects on later mood state. This uncoupling of viewing negative emotional images and affect among Yoga practitioners may be occasioned by their selective implementation of frontal executive-dependent strategies to reduce emotional interference during competing cognitive demands and not during emotional processing per se.",6,,48,48,Attentional control; Psychology; Stroop effect; Cognition; Neurocognitive; Amygdala; Mindfulness; Affect (psychology); Meditation; Clinical psychology,emotion-cognition; fMRI; mindfulness,,,NIDA NIH HHS (R03 DA026536) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (R03 DA032517) United States,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2012.00048/pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnint.2012.00048/full https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Eric_Garland/publication/230599920_Neurocognitive_correlates_of_the_effects_of_yoga_meditation_practice_on_emotion_and_cognition_a_pilot_study/links/09e4150644a9fe158f000000.pdf https://drericgarland.files.wordpress.com/2012/08/froeliger-garland-2012-yoga-meditation-fmri.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3405281 https://doaj.org/article/31733f11866d4446bf7ec809656da210 https://core.ac.uk/display/82865389 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22855674 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnint.2012.00048/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82865389.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnint.2012.00048,22855674,10.3389/fnint.2012.00048,2007799238,PMC3405281,0,000-052-190-360-888; 002-617-831-003-273; 002-984-172-461-32X; 003-594-018-430-480; 005-097-575-391-272; 005-805-453-463-041; 006-784-015-459-671; 006-867-419-035-713; 009-657-545-196-677; 010-072-999-345-640; 010-352-583-373-302; 010-425-096-328-488; 010-882-228-479-821; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-779-204-692-752; 014-515-370-948-845; 015-271-400-626-272; 015-717-841-456-647; 015-854-357-779-664; 016-359-244-051-632; 016-678-838-282-831; 016-753-628-542-604; 019-911-858-898-470; 021-596-700-267-307; 024-489-416-676-58X; 024-717-415-664-132; 027-423-013-331-613; 029-097-121-076-834; 030-434-134-733-071; 031-753-179-149-009; 032-892-766-200-952; 036-138-621-911-711; 037-207-764-259-575; 039-789-741-392-15X; 042-367-882-793-756; 043-254-845-081-86X; 043-354-533-380-666; 044-199-150-249-520; 045-564-967-509-752; 047-030-028-346-904; 047-078-205-026-083; 048-803-042-297-318; 053-867-894-946-895; 055-231-138-788-894; 056-523-449-487-715; 059-386-569-192-955; 059-657-700-582-695; 061-896-795-846-939; 066-727-357-657-34X; 069-189-258-208-593; 071-274-642-268-839; 078-618-649-689-784; 078-756-427-046-762; 081-001-781-377-129; 081-612-932-071-438; 082-983-722-032-923; 086-050-770-444-851; 087-164-733-373-523; 091-396-916-973-684; 093-632-317-915-823; 099-125-169-738-002; 111-765-991-529-342; 114-998-000-208-326; 118-056-374-356-776; 118-629-627-420-04X; 130-252-032-471-881; 131-090-635-404-167; 137-236-865-208-214; 138-334-704-586-850; 146-560-179-513-113,67

This is commonly referred to as the “horsemeat scandal”. The purpose of this paper is to investigate consumers’ preferences across Europe for a selected ready meal, ready to heat (RTH) fresh lasagne, to consider whether the effects of potential food frauds on consumers’ choices can be mitigated by introducing enhanced standards of RTH products. Design/methodology/approach – An online survey was administered to 4,598 consumers of RTH lasagne in six European countries (Republic of Ireland, France, Italy, Spain, Germany and Norway), applying discrete choice experiments to estimate consumers’ willingness to pay for enhanced food safety standards and highlight differences between countries. Findings – Many similarities across countries emerged, as well as some differences.

Participants read descriptions of big or small animals standing in short, medium, and long rows (e.g., There are 8 elephants/ants in a row) and subsequently estimated the probability that a health statement about them was true (e.g., All elephants/ants are healthy). Statements about large animals scored lower than statements about small animals, confirming classical findings that humans perceive groups of large objects as being more numerous than groups of small objects (Binet 1890) and suggesting that object size effects in covert numerosity estimations are particularly robust. Also, statements about longer rows scored lower than statements about shorter rows (cf.

In the academic literature, several vaccination advocates argue that the evaluation frame for vaccines should be expanded to give a more complete picture of their benefits. We seek to contribute to the debate and facilitate informed dialogue about vaccine assessment using visualization, as able to support both deliberation by technical committees about the substance of evaluation and communication of the underlying rationale to non-expert stakeholders. Methods We present two visualizations, an Individual Risk Plot (IRP) and a Population Impact Plot (PIP), both showing the beneficiary population on one axis and the degree of individual benefit and cost of an individual dose on the second axis. We sketch out such graphs for ten vaccines belonging to the UK routine childhood immunization schedule and present our own analysis for the rotavirus and meningitis B vaccines. Results While the IRPs help classify diseases by morbidity and mortality, the PIPs display the health and economic loss averted after introducing a vaccine, allowing further comparisons.

He shows that there is an interesting class of problems that, intuitively, no rational belief forming method is likely to get right. But a Bayesian agent’s credence, before the problem starts, that she will get the problem right has to be 1. This is an implausible kind of immodesty on the part of Bayesians. My aim is to show that while this is a good argument against traditional, precise Bayesians, the argument doesn’t neatly extend to imprecise Bayesians. As such, Belot’s argument is a reason to prefer imprecise Bayesianism to precise Bayesianism.Publisher PDFPeer reviewe",2,20201214,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.3998/ergo.12405314.0002.020,,10.3998/ergo.12405314.0002.020,,,0,,0

Michels,"The theory of adaptation-level was developed by Helson to provide a general treatment of judgment.1 The theory states that each psychophysical judgment is determined by the physical ratio of the stimulus presented for judgment to the current level of adaptation. The adaptation-level, AL, is defined as the stimulus-value judged neutral (absolute judgment) or judged equal to the standard (comparative judgment), and the theory asserts that AL will be equal to a weighted mean of all stimuli affecting judgment. Thus each stimulus, whether singled out for judgment or merely present as background for the judged stimuli, pulls AL toward its own value just as each score in a distribution pulls the mean toward its own value.",,,,,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1419667,https://www.jstor.org/stable/1419667,,,2988079682,,0,,0
079-597-646-258-07X,“Bamboozled by Our Own Words”: Semantic Blindness and Some Arguments Against Contextualism*,,2006,journal article,Philosophy and Phenomenological Research,00318205; 19331592,Wiley,United States,Keith DeRose,"The best grounds for accepting contextualism concerning knowledge attributions are to be found in how knowledge-attributing (and knowledge-denying) sentences are used in ordinary, non-philosophical talk: What ordinary speakers will count as ""knowledge"" in some non-philosophical contexts they will deny is such in others. Contextualists typically appeal to pairs of cases that forcefully display the variability in the epistemic standards that govern ordinary usage: A ""low standards"" case (henceforth, ""LOW"") in which a speaker seems quite appropriately and truthfully to ascribe knowledge to a subject will be paired with a ""high standards"" case (""HIGH"") in which another speaker in a quite different and more demanding context seems with equal propriety and truth to say that the same subject (or a similarly positioned subject) does not know. The contextualist argument based on such cases is driven by the premises that the positive attribution of knowledge in LOW is true, and that the denial of knowledge in HIGH is true. And where the contextualist has constructed HIGH and LOW wisely, those premises are in turn powerfully supported by the two mutually reinforcing strands of evidence that both of the claims intuitively seem true, and that both claims are perfectly appropriate. The resulting argument for contextualism is very powerful indeed, but I am on the offensive making that case in another paper: ""The Ordinary Language Basis for Contextualism and the New Invariantism.""1 Here I play defense, defending contextualism from several related objections. First, an objection from comparative judgments of content: It is alleged that the denial of knowledge in HIGH seems to contradict the affirmation of knowledge in LOW, and that this is a problem for contextualism. Second, an objection from metalinguistic claims: It is alleged that if S-HIGH (the speaker in HIGH) and S-LOW (the speaker in LOW) were told of each",73,2,316,338,Epistemology; Analytic philosophy; Ordinary language philosophy; Psychology; Offensive; Philosophy of mind; Appeal; Denial; Contextualism; Contemporary philosophy,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00620.x https://campuspress.yale.edu/keithderose/files/2015/12/Bamboozled-18txp34.pdf https://www.jstor.org/stable/40040973 https://philpapers.org/rec/DERBBO https://www.philosophy.rutgers.edu/joomlatools-files/docman-files/DeRose.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00620.x,,10.1111/j.1933-1592.2006.tb00620.x,2007901051,,0,,51

Such comparative formats can reduce the impact of numerous response biases often affecting single-stimulus items (aka rating or Likert scales). However, if scored with traditional methodology, MFC instruments produce ipsative data, whereby all individuals have a common total test score. Ipsative scoring distorts individual profiles (it is impossible to achieve all high or all low scale scores), construct validity (covariances between scales must sum to zero), criterion-related validity (validity coefficients must sum to zero), and reliability estimates. We argue that these problems are caused by inadequate scoring of forced-choice items and advocate the use of item response theory (IRT) models based on an appropriate response process for comparative data, such as Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment. We show that when Thurstonian IRT modeling is applied (Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011), even existing forcedchoice questionnaires with challenging features can be scored adequately and that the IRT-estimated scores are free from the problems of ipsative data.",18,1,36,52,Statistics; Test validity; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Psychological testing; Law of comparative judgment; Item response theory; Construct validity; Ipsative; Test score,,"Humans; Models, Psychological; Psychometrics/standards; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards",,Catalan Government; Spanish Ministry of Education,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23148475 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1004409 http://core.ac.uk/display/10635630 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148475 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/30530/ http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0030641 http://www.ub.edu/gdne/documents/ipsative_data.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-30275-001 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/30530/1/Brown%20&%20Maydeu-Olivares%202012%20PsychMethods%20Post-print%20self-archive.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10635630.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0030641,23148475,10.1037/a0030641,2168767193,,0,000-213-931-311-544; 003-234-442-173-306; 004-414-436-917-174; 005-944-986-860-875; 010-637-180-131-244; 011-325-175-516-004; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-605-981-755-950; 015-241-838-192-918; 016-926-000-460-104; 017-504-153-087-087; 018-093-885-932-859; 022-134-763-599-43X; 022-784-190-934-417; 024-217-408-708-554; 026-111-756-873-764; 029-291-085-676-195; 032-171-661-043-68X; 035-586-436-180-18X; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-806-031-318-759; 038-325-928-190-468; 040-542-869-705-443; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-645-459-184-264; 043-209-749-101-784; 046-039-497-858-085; 046-455-312-385-676; 047-296-035-913-231; 048-058-555-109-207; 058-462-621-956-920; 065-130-290-645-468; 072-527-793-787-571; 079-743-335-576-735; 080-379-244-700-11X; 090-460-864-082-122; 095-269-978-788-939; 102-693-982-590-25X; 119-063-668-084-122; 123-600-993-524-166; 137-683-385-733-057; 158-473-971-253-175; 164-779-008-985-991; 184-163-882-210-658,95

Müller; Jens Rommel,"Abstract With liberalization in 1998, numerous firms have entered the German retail electricity market, including newly formed consumer cooperatives. Based on Transaction Cost Economics, we develop a theoretical framework seeking to explain preferences for electricity supplied by cooperatives from a consumer perspective. Drawing on a convenience sample of 287 German electricity consumers and Choice Experiment data from an online survey, we estimate Willingness-to-Pay values for organizational attributes of electricity suppliers, while accounting for observed and unobserved heterogeneity. Consumers in the sample exhibit a large Willingness-to-Pay for renewable energy. Our results also indicate a substantial Willingness-to-Pay for transparent pricing, participation in decision making, and local suppliers. Democratic decision making – a distinct feature of cooperatives – exhibits positive Willingness-to-Pay values for approximately one fifth of the sample. Taken together, our findings suggest a slightly higher Willingness-to-Pay for electricity produced by cooperatives.

Typically, the measure of preference observations takes the form of simple binary outcomes, indicating which of the two objects or treatments in a particular comparison is preferred. Common examples of such situations include models of choice behaviour in politics or marketing, comparisons of medical treatments or in the realm of sports rankings. We investigate situations where the observed measure of preference for the paired comparisons is instead a continuous outcome indicating not simply the direction of preference but the degree of preference as well; in particular, we present, as a motivating example, a ranking analysis of the top 12 international limited overs cricket teams, with an appropriately defined margin of victory in individual matches playing the role of the measure of preference. We propose a new method, which is termed moderated paired comparisons, that is based on fitting a penalized likelihood model to the observed margins of victory. Importantly, the structure of the penalty function chosen allows for the model to assign differential importance to the information that is contained solely in the dichotomous win–loss outcome of a match as against that contained in the actual margin of the victory.",60,3,397,415,Statistics; Econometrics; Logistic regression; Pairwise comparison; Beta distribution; Victory; Bradley–Terry model; Penalized likelihood; Mathematics; Binary number; Penalty method,,,,,https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:bla:jorssc:v:60:y:2011:i:3:p:397-415 https://research.bond.edu.au/en/publications/moderated-paired-comparisons-a-generalized-bradley-terry-model-fo https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/jorssc/v60y2011i3p397-415.html http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00751.x/abstract https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/26091 https://rss.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00751.x https://openresearch-repository.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/26091,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00751.x,,10.1111/j.1467-9876.2010.00751.x,2118068355,,0,008-400-306-798-435; 021-481-219-273-647; 029-645-704-758-241; 030-047-965-288-247; 030-522-939-668-721; 043-741-941-481-335; 046-645-764-444-881; 050-152-422-558-386; 055-770-896-768-684; 061-497-880-039-156; 069-263-057-569-07X; 075-462-117-970-711; 085-543-831-272-379; 088-025-186-680-589; 096-985-380-229-968; 114-580-493-725-998; 127-263-374-645-621; 142-256-653-568-858; 142-718-762-497-001; 146-106-136-694-890; 152-099-533-908-172; 157-189-775-028-646; 179-598-636-592-867; 192-078-021-601-677,8

Recent work on linguistic accent emphasizes the role of accent in person perception and social categorization, demonstrating that accent serves as a mean- ingful ethnic category indicator. In this paper, we examine whether accent can be used to implement socio-cultural mark- ers. We investigate whether the accent of a virtual character, as a marker for culture, can cause cultural frame-shifts in indi- viduals. We report an experiment, performed among bicultural and monocultural individuals, in which we test the above hy- pothesis. Our results show that accent can have a socio-cultural effect on people’s cognition. Keywords: accent, culture, frame-switching, biculturalism Introduction There is a substantial amount of research focusing on the in- fluence of language on human cognition. Language, at its core, is a cognitive tool that helps us construct shared mean- ings, categorize our knowledge, and thus piece together the various associative networks of collective experiences to form our perception of the world around us. According to the Whorfian hypothesis (Whorf, 1956), the grammar of a lan- guage and the manner in which the language is processed can provide a glance into the implicit organization of knowledge in that culture. This inherent influence is reflected in the be- lief that the grammatical structure of a language shapes our interactions due to the speakers inherent exposure to certain observations and mental representations, otherwise known as the principle of linguistic relativity (Chiu, Leung, & Kwan, The results from previous studies with bilingual partici- pants support the use of language as a means of activating as- sociated cultural constructs. For instance, Chinese bilinguals randomly assigned to respond in Chinese reported more col- lective self-statements in open-ended self-descriptions, lower self-esteem, and more agreement with Chinese cultural views (Ross, Xun, & Wilson, 2002). These qualities are in line with traits commonly associated with Eastern collectivist cul- tures. The findings also suggest that cultural identities may be stored in separate knowledge structures and activated by the associated language. Marian and Neisser (2000) exam- ined the retrieval of autobiographical memories in bicultural individuals and found that memories become more accessi- ble when the language used at retrieval matched the language used at encoding. In other words, Russian-English bilin- guals were able to remember more events from the Russian- speaking period of their lives when they responded in Rus- sian and more experiences from the English-speaking period of their lives when they responded in English. In their meta-analysis of cross-cultural studies of self- enhancement, Heine and Hamamura (2007) point out the lim- itations and confounds in existing research regarding whether language can independently prime a cultural mindframe. Lee, Oyserman, and Bond (2010) attended to these short- comings in their study by exploring the effect of experi- mentally manipulated language use on value endorsements and self-descriptions. By unobtrusively manipulating lan- guage as a prime, they found that bilingual participants ran- domly assigned to use English reported significantly more self-enhancing social comparative judgements than those us- ing Chinese. In addition, English users demonstrated more social distancing after under-performance and standardized their failure in the context of the behavior of their peers in order to protect their positive self-regard. This is in line with the expected behavior of someone from an individualist culture and touches on the work done by Tesser (2000) and Kwan et al. (2004) regarding the mechanisms employed to protect, augment, or maintain self-esteem.The above findings also support the claim that societies are socialized for both in- dividual and collective mindsets, but responses are dependent on the cultural mindset salient at the moment of self-reflection (Lee et al., 2010). This literature demonstrates the cognitive implications of experimentally manipulating language as a prime to prompt a shift in an individuals cultural mindset. The findings from these studies support the use of language as a marker for cul- ture, however, in this paper we aim tease apart the specific aspects of language that act as cultural markers, e.g., by ma- nipulating accents. Ethnolinguistic identity theory indicates that language plays a crucial role in the formation and cate- gorization of one’s ethnic identity (Giles, Bourhis, & Taylor, 1977). Rakiˇc, Steffens, and Mummendey (2011a) compared the strength of vocal accents compared to facial visual ap- pearance as indicators for ethnic categorization. They found that not only did accent serve as a meaningful ethnic cate- gory indicator, but participants also overlooked visual stim- uli, such as facial features typically associated with a culture, in the presence of this more meaningful auditory information (Rakiˇc et al., 2011a).

Here we explore whether achievement can be assessed by testing conceptual understanding across domains.; This follows previous work in which we showed that comparative judgement, based on pairwise expert judgements of students’ work rather than rubrics and scoring, can be used to measure understanding of a specific concept (e.g. fractions). In the present study, school students (N = 197) sat open-ended tests sampling a range of concepts, and their responses were comparatively judged. Analysis supported the validity of the approach for assessing general achievement. We conclude that comparative judgement could help improve the assessment of mathematics.",,,,,Rubric; Procedural knowledge; Mathematics education; Pairwise comparison; Judgement; Computer science; Sampling (statistics),,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/conference_contribution/An_alternative_approach_to_assessing_achievement/9373622,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/conference_contribution/An_alternative_approach_to_assessing_achievement/9373622,,,2417543767,,0,016-279-152-792-986; 033-896-251-435-132; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 076-610-441-182-635; 082-101-966-612-53X; 082-657-515-340-970; 149-896-695-737-445; 179-726-268-053-176,2

Suppose that a collection of items is repeatedly compared in pairs, and one wishes to recover a consistent ordering that emphasizes the top-$K$ ranked items, based on partially revealed preferences. We focus on the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model that postulates a set of latent preference scores underlying all items, where the odds of paired comparisons depend only on the relative scores of the items involved. ; We characterize the minimax limits on identifiability of top-$K$ ranked items, in the presence of random and non-adaptive sampling. Our results highlight a separation measure that quantifies the gap of preference scores between the $K^{\text{th}}$ and $(K+1)^{\text{th}}$ ranked items. The minimum sample complexity required for reliable top-$K$ ranking scales inversely with the separation measure irrespective of other preference distribution metrics. To approach this minimax limit, we propose a nearly linear-time ranking scheme, called \emph{Spectral MLE}, that returns the indices of the top-$K$ items in accordance to a careful score estimate. In a nutshell, Spectral MLE starts with an initial score estimate with minimal squared loss (obtained via a spectral method), and then successively refines each component with the assistance of coordinate-wise MLEs. Encouragingly, Spectral MLE allows perfect top-$K$ item identification under minimal sample complexity. The practical applicability of Spectral MLE is further corroborated by numerical experiments.",,,,,Statistics; Identifiability; Odds; Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Spectral method; Aggregation problem; Mathematics; Sampling (statistics),,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07218 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07218.pdf https://128.84.21.199/abs/1504.07218?context=cs https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1504.07218 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1504.07218 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150407218C/abstract,https://arxiv.org/abs/1504.07218,,,2132572278,,0,001-631-224-533-795; 004-848-515-510-16X; 008-510-382-037-766; 010-132-302-334-522; 010-136-645-510-231; 015-619-786-644-899; 023-478-492-046-416; 027-585-752-786-939; 030-713-561-106-154; 033-240-242-918-034; 050-442-961-595-51X; 050-943-988-713-681; 051-173-879-787-575; 054-013-791-330-77X; 064-989-848-170-832; 066-809-414-974-229; 067-860-359-894-241; 070-976-953-622-524; 074-476-690-145-141; 081-370-959-105-221; 082-555-883-092-977; 087-351-485-660-85X; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-033-188-521-321; 092-025-047-854-336; 096-979-791-156-213; 109-135-368-500-689; 109-634-740-013-008; 109-668-006-494-690; 116-610-520-777-687; 123-524-633-373-163; 136-510-755-969-787; 149-228-667-566-569; 153-121-694-099-331; 154-209-779-028-826; 156-403-614-670-353; 161-247-307-055-667; 163-901-691-956-641; 168-838-973-937-775; 172-520-776-223-903; 173-849-173-940-516; 181-375-967-075-390; 192-803-196-532-780; 193-963-159-861-509; 196-686-533-213-568,32

The findings suggest that both traditional marking and Comparative Judgment can produce reliable and valid results for the cohort used to trial these questions. The most obvious explanation for this result is that most of the students struggled so much with the calculations they were required to make that they were unable to offer analysis or interpretation of data. With little analysis offered, there was little subjectivity inherent in the assessment, so the students’ work could be assessed objectively using either traditional marking or Comparative Judgement.",,,,,Mathematics education; Psychology; Subjectivity; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Curriculum,,,,,http://www.mei.org.uk/files/pdf/CMassessmentReport.pdf,http://www.mei.org.uk/files/pdf/CMassessmentReport.pdf,,,2186268733,,0,,0

These improvements, found in adult human observers, were highly specific to simple visual features, such as location in the visual field, spatial-frequency, local and global orientation, and in some cases even the eye of origin. The results were interpreted as arising from the plasticity of sensory brain regions that display those features of specificity within their constituting neuronal subpopulations. A new view of the visual cortex has emerged, according to which a degree of plasticity is retained at adult age, allowing flexibility in acquiring new visual skills when the need arises. Although this “sensory plasticity” interpretation is often questioned, it is commonly believed that learning has access to detailed low-level visual representations residing within the visual cortex. More recent studies during the last decade revealed the conditions needed for learning and the conditions under which learning can be generalized across stimuli and tasks. The results are consistent with an account of perceptual learning according to which visual processing is remodeled by the brain, utilizing sensory information acquired during task performance. The stability of the visual system is viewed as an adaptation to a stable environment and instances of perceptual learning as a reaction of the brain to abrupt changes in the environment. Training on a restricted stimulus set may lead to perceptual overfitting and over-specificity. The systemic methodology developed for perceptual learning, and the accumulated knowledge, allows us to explore issues related to learning and memory in general, such as learning rules, reinforcement, memory consolidation, and neural rehabilitation. A persistent open question is the neuro-anatomical substrate underlying these learning effects.",51,13,1552,1566,Psychology; Visual search; Gaze-contingency paradigm; Visual memory; Cognitive psychology;

I then sketch a theory of rational commitment, showing how this notion solves the symmetry problem as I’ve presented it.

The Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) was applied to derive factor weights using MATLAB with reasonable consistency ratio (CR). The frequency ratio (FR) model was used to derive class frequency ratio or class weights that indicate the relative importance of individual classes for each factor. The weighted linear combination (WLC) method was used to determine the landslide susceptibility index value (LSIV) on a GIS platform, by incorporating both factor weights and class weights.

Dunn; Rhodri Cusack; Bundy Mackintosh,"The implicit control of emotion processing was investigated by varying encoding instructions for both negative and neutral pictures while measuring psychophysiological responses. Participants made comparative judgments about consecutive pictures for blocks of neutral or negative content. The highly specified judgment task was designed to minimize variance in the implementation of implicit control of processing. Affective modulation of startle amplitude was significantly reduced during judgments involving nonnegative content (how ""planned"" an image was compared to its predecessor), compared to those that involved negative content (how ""frightening"" an image was compared to its predecessor), indicating successful implicit control of processing. The more attenuated affect modulation was, the less anxious individuals became during the task, suggesting that the implicit control of emotion processing is significantly associated with emotional experience. These data provide convergent evidence for a companion neuroimaging study because of the similar neural substrates thought to underlie affective modulation of startle. This supports the view that higher-level top-down pathways modulate activation of the amygdala.",8,6,828,837,Moro reflex; Psychology; Cognition; Visual perception; Cognitive psychology; Amygdala; Startle reaction; Anxiety; Neuroimaging; Information processing,,"Adolescent; Affect; Anxiety/diagnosis; Attention; Extinction, Psychological; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reflex, Startle/physiology; Visual Perception",,Medical Research Council (MC_U105579215) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (MC_U105592690) United Kingdom,http://core.ac.uk/display/2765386 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19102594 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/5641/ https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/15047/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0014146,19102594,10.1037/a0014146,2162899903,,0,005-095-207-311-102; 008-990-660-940-732; 010-025-282-555-85X; 012-392-187-722-83X; 013-368-874-808-615; 013-698-999-791-097; 015-154-358-430-029; 016-031-425-130-998; 016-433-899-989-288; 017-538-187-705-854; 028-694-302-285-976; 031-480-348-109-083; 032-677-565-882-481; 036-120-403-043-965; 036-373-238-105-864; 042-963-840-425-008; 045-653-461-012-460; 046-412-569-555-765; 049-351-905-525-614; 049-582-513-997-039; 050-036-057-108-695; 050-567-222-121-66X; 051-197-467-145-96X; 053-792-427-606-812; 065-229-049-384-222; 068-610-754-716-01X; 069-967-432-862-848; 078-191-521-207-539; 081-001-781-377-129; 087-164-733-373-523; 091-096-794-802-11X; 093-661-820-174-287; 099-710-038-806-586; 104-169-283-367-667; 109-366-947-480-73X; 117-052-046-386-453; 124-952-466-172-643; 129-102-911-921-384; 132-773-073-970-886; 139-454-542-717-573; 153-617-505-637-823; 164-494-557-574-213,12
080-951-393-809-527,Testing the validity of judgements about geography essays using the Adaptive Comparative Judgement method,2012-10-24,2012,,,,,,Claire Whitehouse,"Adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ) is an alternative to marking that presents judges with pairs of students’ work and asks them to decide, holistically, which piece of work contains more of a specified trait or set of traits. There are a number of reports on the highly reliable rank orders achieved using ACJ. However, none of these reports addresses the validity of the criteria on which judges base their decisions. The reliability of the rank ordering of 564 AS-level geography essays by 23 teachers or examiners of geography was reported previously. The judges in this study were asked to use their professional judgement when making decisions about essays; they were not provided with mark schemes or assessment objectives, but two importance statements were made available to them. After each judgement (92.4% of the total), the judges in this empirical study made notes about what was to the forefront of their minds when they made a decision between two essays. The investigation reported here uses thematic analysis of these notes to identify and test the validity of the criteria the judges used to make their decisions. On the whole the judges used the language of the mark scheme and the assessment objectives when describing the knowledge demonstrated in the essays. They used language from these two sources to a lesser extent when describing skills, but nonetheless indirect links could be established between the content of the notes and existing documents. These links demonstrate the use of existing shared criteria by the judges, thus the validity of the criteria used by judges in their decision-making was confirmed. However, these criteria are already established as part of examiner training, marking and teacher support. This has implications for the introduction of ACJ as a replacement for marking, which are discussed.",,,,,Trait; Empirical research; Psychology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Teacher support; Professional judgement; Thematic analysis; Applied psychology; Social psychology,,,,,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method https://research.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method http://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method,http://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method,,,1918381019,,0,008-690-892-911-290; 017-792-980-099-478; 020-492-282-615-504; 025-677-136-905-020; 030-159-505-970-284; 037-550-015-414-716; 048-091-210-665-560; 062-826-283-401-218; 076-789-172-721-292; 084-568-415-452-121; 089-686-651-949-112; 091-187-114-869-104; 112-375-692-314-045; 148-976-132-772-558; 158-650-875-509-18X; 170-760-456-367-609,3

The floodplains of both streams are within the metropolitan area of the city of Valencia (Spain’s third largest city). Following the Mediterranean model, they are very fertile areas (with intense periurban and highly productive agriculture) which have recently absorbed the great urban expansion of the metropolis. Hydrologically these basins remain dry for most of the year, but become particularly dangerous during flash-flood events. They generate a risk pattern highly dependent on exposure since, in general, the hazard factor is very difficult to map, given the unpredictable nature of flash-floods. This work constitutes a proof of concept based on simple estimators obtained from land uses. External vulnerability or exposure is evaluated as a function of economic land value and human exposure to hazard. Land value is directly taken from the cadastre whilst human exposure is indirectly estimated from the location of population in relation to time–activity profiles. The temporal dimension is introduced and three exposure scenarios have been mapped, related to different time periods: working days, nights, weekends and holidays. The results show different patterns of exposure for each plain. In Carraixet floodplain exposure is greater at night and on weekends and holidays than during working hours, on account of the dominant agricultural and residential land uses. In the Poyo plain there are no major contrasts in absolute terms between day and night time, although spatial patterns of exposure vary from day to night: during the day, exposure is higher in industrial and commercial areas (around communication routes) whilst at night residential areas show more exposure.",31,1,136,145,Physical geography; Cadastre; Floodplain; Metropolitan area; Flooding (psychology); Geography; Population; Mediterranean climate; Land use; Cartography; Flood myth,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/71032739 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0143622810000299 https://pubag.nal.usda.gov/catalog/868857 http://roderic.uv.es/handle/10550/39744,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.03.003,,10.1016/j.apgeog.2010.03.003,2091957799,,0,006-703-609-763-85X; 006-727-328-200-598; 007-736-595-402-507; 008-029-466-884-849; 010-321-080-764-350; 019-455-085-625-422; 020-628-022-652-579; 024-984-872-066-409; 033-815-394-580-030; 041-221-197-573-79X; 041-650-632-528-690; 044-410-285-491-470; 048-084-296-279-63X; 055-879-421-005-412; 062-373-180-067-967; 071-351-118-661-980; 075-783-675-287-535; 075-799-890-513-124; 076-961-758-248-692; 078-353-355-945-120; 078-803-707-584-53X; 087-467-919-196-068; 087-528-746-704-517; 097-514-108-922-654; 100-400-212-718-849; 106-071-918-431-771; 112-075-129-895-966; 124-864-530-215-194; 125-724-447-463-80X; 125-801-020-829-303; 126-432-756-165-648; 127-401-065-250-442; 129-796-023-162-331; 129-954-858-251-472; 131-809-782-695-616; 134-491-914-789-49X; 143-048-301-716-802; 147-490-086-133-184; 148-476-511-056-470; 150-143-747-947-612; 154-925-805-491-054; 159-744-522-099-326; 161-898-873-744-183; 164-285-464-235-959; 172-328-452-839-162; 177-169-778-924-646; 187-584-475-913-211; 192-141-795-681-69X; 194-845-441-345-574; 195-501-075-893-366,30

However, these documents offer little concrete guidance for implementing this requirement and determining when it is satisfied. As a result, those charged with risk-benefit evaluations currently assess the risk-benefit profile of biomedical research studies in unsystematic ways, raising concern that some research participants are not being protected from excessive risks and that some valuable studies involving acceptable risk are being rejected. The present paper aims to address this situation by delineating the first comprehensive framework, which is based on existing guidelines and regulations as well as the relevant literature, for risk-benefit evaluations in biomedical research.",21,2,141,179,Risk assessment; Research ethics; Psychology; MEDLINE; Research studies; Engineering ethics; Social value orientations; Informed consent,,"Biomedical Research/ethics; Clinical Trials as Topic/ethics; Ethics, Research; Humans; Informed Consent/ethics; Research/organization & administration; Risk Assessment/methods; Social Values",,,https://philpapers.org/rec/WENAFF-2 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21696094/ http://core.ac.uk/display/11285132 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/54897/1/2011_Rid_A_A_Framework_for_Risk-Benefit_Evaluations.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21696094 http://muse.jhu.edu/article/439953/pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/54897/ http://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/54897/1/2011_Rid_A_A_Framework_for_Risk-Benefit_Evaluations.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/ken.2011.0007,21696094,10.1353/ken.2011.0007,1983476765,,0,001-661-409-575-841; 002-661-173-819-278; 003-175-695-359-355; 004-061-430-141-618; 004-874-142-557-756; 006-334-349-815-199; 007-115-703-941-582; 007-793-610-367-406; 008-499-438-933-603; 008-674-137-729-858; 009-096-145-523-280; 010-425-334-441-17X; 012-477-421-021-875; 013-591-484-776-699; 014-869-676-757-433; 016-907-376-720-572; 021-957-181-585-231; 022-047-333-882-715; 023-191-784-438-827; 024-633-803-796-85X; 024-763-338-150-732; 024-962-724-211-830; 025-914-388-430-101; 025-932-267-329-09X; 030-699-183-230-01X; 031-474-944-898-030; 033-243-959-386-104; 036-115-085-929-907; 037-255-613-295-268; 039-990-512-780-401; 041-157-328-411-587; 043-728-910-225-666; 045-395-737-868-050; 047-767-246-505-64X; 050-351-426-855-347; 051-967-068-226-701; 054-679-878-310-676; 056-504-319-717-195; 057-110-582-116-535; 058-060-731-912-716; 060-322-859-686-323; 061-751-367-645-965; 063-031-285-631-217; 063-255-387-613-864; 063-359-122-936-082; 066-893-289-143-905; 067-597-794-883-795; 069-394-728-783-940; 069-727-881-724-448; 071-484-024-335-235; 078-361-479-500-967; 085-743-503-065-457; 088-287-300-975-680; 096-490-415-009-371; 107-308-560-947-51X; 109-504-772-609-88X; 111-799-486-928-874; 113-284-474-714-721; 130-744-292-694-310; 148-223-435-969-407; 159-634-985-216-931; 169-221-416-023-758; 169-503-457-688-946; 190-723-198-576-872; 193-690-404-726-845,80

It is an important concept in a variety of areas such as cognitive psychology, computer vision and visualization, and advertisement. Yet, efforts to create large, downloadable image datasets with diverse content and unbiased groundtruthing are lacking. In this work, we introduce Savoias, a visual complexity dataset that compromises of more than 1,400 images from seven image categories relevant to the above research areas, namely Scenes, Advertisements, Visualization and infographics, Objects, Interior design, Art, and Suprematism. The images in each category portray diverse characteristics including various low-level and high-level features, objects, backgrounds, textures and patterns, text, and graphics. The ground truth for Savoias is obtained by crowdsourcing more than 37,000 pairwise comparisons of images using the forced-choice methodology and with more than 1,600 contributors. The resulting relative scores are then converted to absolute visual complexity scores using the Bradley-Terry method and matrix completion. When applying five state-of-the-art algorithms to analyze the visual complexity of the images in the Savoias dataset, we found that the scores obtained from these baseline tools only correlate well with crowdsourced labels for abstract patterns in the Suprematism category (Pearson correlation r=0.84). For the other categories, in particular, the objects and advertisement categories, low correlation coefficients were revealed (r=0.3 and 0.56, respectively). These findings suggest that (1) state-of-the-art approaches are mostly insufficient and (2) Savoias enables category-specific method development, which is likely to improve the impact of visual complexity analysis on specific application areas, including computer vision.",,,,,Ground truth; Artificial intelligence; Infographic; Pairwise comparison; Natural language processing; Graphics; Matrix completion; Visualization; Computer science; Pearson product-moment correlation coefficient; Crowdsourcing,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01771.pdf https://www.arxiv-vanity.com/papers/1810.01771/ https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771 https://open.bu.edu/handle/2144/37603 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1810.html#abs-1810-01771 https://ru.arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1810.01771,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1810.01771,,,2895576959,,0,002-008-566-010-005; 007-019-015-904-307; 008-872-967-187-442; 009-272-211-365-744; 009-624-337-491-080; 011-930-712-854-515; 013-901-094-038-405; 016-171-301-287-816; 018-663-123-142-860; 019-616-903-300-510; 021-228-394-994-59X; 023-008-104-294-658; 032-439-016-252-459; 041-056-605-156-906; 042-104-153-210-587; 047-699-108-926-639; 048-141-151-036-598; 050-270-448-249-677; 052-322-599-429-311; 065-819-195-728-230; 070-821-459-707-630; 073-563-475-784-273; 079-877-406-165-903; 080-508-171-084-51X; 080-941-407-675-496; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-991-691-200-809; 093-539-423-650-420; 095-516-522-557-599; 113-278-954-446-219; 125-612-169-047-489; 137-618-213-830-730; 143-245-303-423-192; 162-249-988-682-29X; 168-311-698-000-898; 191-583-133-628-963; 196-494-893-831-662,1

Srivastava,"Context effects refer to the shifts in shares when another alternative is introduced in the choice set. The alternative can be asymmetrically dominated, asymmetrically dominating, totally dominated, or totally dominating. We developed a theoretically derived model based on the shifts in attribute valuation as a potential explanation for all context effects. First, the model is tested using data from previously published studies. As predicted, the results showed a high correlation between shifts in valuation and changes in the choice shares. The model is also tested using 2 studies that extend the design of the choice sets to include better alternatives in a search context and the removal of an alternative. The strong relation justifies the case for comparative valuation as an underlying mechanism for context effects. Assuming this valuation, the article illustrates how the framework can be used to develop new product strategies taking into account the values of the unchosen alternatives.",9,3,167,177,Econometrics; Economics; Choice set; Valuation (finance); New product development; Context effect,,,,,http://eprints.exchange.isb.edu/903/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1057740800703354 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1207/S15327663JCP0903_4,http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327663jcp0903_4,,10.1207/s15327663jcp0903_4,2089312479,,0,003-037-500-030-168; 010-187-197-939-391; 011-834-768-261-866; 017-320-982-699-180; 028-902-240-555-494; 032-037-002-355-965; 035-681-293-954-082; 036-662-229-628-12X; 038-337-847-964-618; 043-271-342-349-398; 045-449-936-633-589; 049-172-715-307-217; 055-930-225-537-893; 059-959-618-575-238; 061-009-862-863-875; 061-517-830-110-36X; 062-267-742-215-628; 068-507-553-395-023; 070-846-178-477-083; 075-349-511-042-863; 075-671-829-843-316; 084-753-212-666-642; 085-097-176-017-71X; 087-007-284-664-667; 087-969-217-930-504; 097-094-825-466-059; 098-906-923-169-91X; 104-299-174-213-795; 107-113-352-618-906; 115-178-654-526-940; 124-472-204-654-607; 127-089-314-114-318; 129-522-169-637-514; 135-787-975-944-616; 138-754-792-154-599; 155-284-773-440-074; 157-147-061-488-768,40

Duchi; Lester Mackey; Michael I. Jordan,"We consider the predictive problem of supervised ranking, where the task is to rank sets of candidate items returned in response to queries. Although there exist statistical procedures that come with guarantees of consistency in this setting, these procedures require that individuals provide a complete ranking of all items, which is rarely feasible in practice. Instead, individuals routinely provide partial preference information, such as pairwise comparisons of items, and more practical approaches to ranking have aimed at modeling this partial preference data directly. As we show, however, such an approach raises serious theoretical challenges. Indeed, we demonstrate that many commonly used surrogate losses for pairwise comparison data do not yield consistency; surprisingly, we show inconsistency even in low-noise settings. With these negative results as motivation, we present a new approach to supervised ranking based on aggregation of partial preferences, and we develop $U$-statistic-based empirical risk minimization procedures. We present an asymptotic analysis of these new procedures, showing that they yield consistency results that parallel those available for classification. We complement our theoretical results with an experiment studying the new procedures in a large-scale web-ranking task.",41,5,2292,2323,Ranking; Asymptotic analysis; Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Fisher consistency; Learning to rank; Empirical risk minimization; Data mining; Ranking SVM; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Asymptotic analysis; Preference data; Mathematics; Learning to rank,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1204.html#abs-1204-1688 http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1204.html#abs-1204-1688 https://projecteuclid.org/euclid.aos/1383661265 https://web.stanford.edu/~lmackey/papers/rankasymptotics-aos13.pdf http://arxiv.org/abs/1204.1688,http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/13-aos1142,,10.1214/13-aos1142,3102424228; 2135745352,,1,003-868-023-351-977; 011-719-768-125-596; 017-424-948-415-144; 017-921-055-505-107; 019-313-788-423-049; 023-478-492-046-416; 025-192-553-715-150; 026-604-885-122-145; 030-391-257-602-883; 031-788-024-934-694; 032-721-031-216-236; 033-018-447-850-70X; 034-012-608-693-75X; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-595-565-554-374; 044-561-974-998-048; 050-973-347-835-627; 052-209-553-791-396; 052-468-724-042-629; 062-210-256-557-086; 068-885-458-943-499; 071-512-225-267-22X; 076-112-539-716-197; 076-783-085-604-867; 078-101-363-334-337; 081-374-391-392-229; 082-298-749-877-760; 083-566-918-355-491; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-912-834-943-633; 091-299-050-457-00X; 094-450-509-220-494; 105-628-862-061-546; 109-668-006-494-690; 113-079-030-498-041; 113-278-954-446-219; 115-080-691-898-297; 116-275-534-296-096; 117-043-721-417-862; 120-072-322-429-12X; 133-628-003-144-496; 138-729-962-867-512; 145-939-821-738-396; 173-254-786-316-238; 177-043-833-771-133; 178-422-975-780-285; 181-411-989-710-354; 183-380-377-449-494; 187-657-750-536-145,18

In a recent study (Gertner et al. in Cortex, doi:10.1016/j.cortex.2012.03.019, 2012), we found that the size congruency effect (SiCE) for physical judgments (i.e., comparing numbers’ physical sizes while ignoring their numerical values, for example, Open image in new window 8) was modulated by the spatial position of the presented numbers. Surprisingly, we found that the neutral condition, which is comprise solely of physical sizes (e.g., Open image in new window 3), was affected as well. This pattern gave rise to the idea that number–space synesthesia might entail not only discrete, ordered, meaningful symbols (i.e., Arabic numbers) but also continuous non-symbolic magnitudes (i.e., sizes, length, luminance, etc.). We tested this idea by assessing the performance of two number–space synesthetes and 12 matched controls in 3 comparative judgment tasks involving symbolic and non-symbolic stimuli: (1) Arabic numbers, (2) dot clusters, and (3) sizes of squares. The spatial position of the presented stimuli was manipulated to be compatible or incompatible with respect to the synesthetic number–space perceptions. Results revealed that for synesthetes, but not for controls, non-symbolic magnitudes (dot clusters) as well as symbolic magnitudes (i.e., Arabic numbers) interacted with space. Our study suggests that number–space synesthetes might have a general magnitude–space association that is not restricted to concrete symbolic stimuli. These findings support recent theories on the perception and evaluation of sizes in numerical cognition.",13,1,179,183,Stimulus (physiology); Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Synesthesia; Numerical cognition; Magnitude (mathematics); Luminance; Arabic numerals; Correlation and dependence,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cp/cp13.html#GertnerAH12 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22810422 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10339-012-0449-9,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/cp/cp13.html#GertnerAH12,,,2039227135,,0,000-203-307-444-846; 001-244-253-407-376; 010-140-848-414-399; 010-818-726-913-655; 015-544-596-134-608; 023-290-232-151-661; 024-126-457-246-305; 029-915-293-337-721; 038-395-026-012-885; 047-571-584-151-480; 069-593-985-303-866; 083-553-608-069-016; 085-168-731-036-529; 114-858-026-742-426,4

R. Alcantud; Ritxar Arlegi,"This paper contributes to the axiomatization of additive rules for ranking sets of objects under the psychological principle of categorization. Firstly we proceed with the case where the elements in the sets are categorized into at most three groups, namely good (with value 1), neutral (with value 0), and bad (with value-1). Secondly, we solve the case where there are only good and neutral elements. In both instances the evaluation of the sets is purely additive. Lastly, we show that dropping one of the axioms in our general characterization produces an axiomatization of the more general class of evaluations where good and bad elements are weighted differently.

Answering this question can shed light on the building blocks of our mathematical abilities. A shared representation theory suggested that discriminability of all magnitudes complies with Weber's law. The current work examined this suggestion. We employed comparative judgment tasks to investigate different types of comparisons - conceptual comparison of numbers, physical comparison of numbers and physical comparison of different shapes. We used 8 different size ratios and plotted reaction time as a function of these ratios. Our findings suggest that the relationship between discriminability and size ratio is not always linear, as previously suggested; rather, it is modulated by the type of comparison and the type of stimuli. Hence, we suggest that the representation of magnitude is not as rigid as previously suggested; it changes as a function of task demands and familiarity with the compared stimuli.",144,2,308,315,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Mathematical ability; Size ratio; Poison control; Injury control; Numerical cognition; Magnitude (mathematics); Arabic numerals,2300; 2340; Non-symbolic comparison; Numerical cognition; Ratio,"Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Recognition, Psychology",,,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23933000 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691813001625 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691813001625#! https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23933000 http://langnum.haifa.ac.il/articles/rubin/Comparative%20judgments%20of%20symbolic%20and%20non-symbolic%20stimuli%20yield%20different%20patterns%20of%20reaction%20times.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.07.010,23933000,10.1016/j.actpsy.2013.07.010,2036315657,,0,000-720-201-572-044; 003-375-024-877-035; 004-030-636-268-081; 004-451-533-015-01X; 005-201-806-256-367; 005-783-682-084-833; 006-548-790-016-05X; 007-402-735-113-601; 007-926-410-139-923; 008-410-324-565-175; 010-080-368-867-08X; 014-304-423-897-683; 014-843-099-036-963; 015-012-693-948-294; 016-046-921-135-036; 016-227-375-936-145; 019-567-702-794-034; 021-566-111-190-893; 024-905-059-802-997; 025-273-714-276-887; 025-970-798-397-03X; 029-559-244-462-632; 033-987-957-285-504; 038-395-026-012-885; 039-555-369-773-746; 057-733-109-082-529; 060-748-407-187-900; 071-057-839-637-721; 072-157-343-216-127; 088-993-411-571-425; 089-534-827-525-987; 092-272-102-076-652; 097-168-070-287-368; 113-746-952-215-032; 114-992-167-812-755; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-458-447-714-278; 120-204-913-104-353,8

As the number of arguments increases and/or a sample size decreases, the ability of conventional means tests and regression models to uncover small but real efiects declines. We present a solution to this problem of the pairwise comparison of arguments: the Bradley-Terry model. Using a survey experiment conducted during a referendum on electoral reform in the province of Ontario, Canada in the fall of 2007, we show how unstructured and structured models can uncover information about the power of arguments and its sources undetected by more conventional methods. In doing so, we gain insight into the factors which drive support or opposition for electoral reform.

Vocal dysperiodicities are summarized by means of a signal-to-dysperiodicity ratio (SDR) marker. It is shown that performing an adaptive forward and backward long-term linear prediction of each speech sample and retaining the minimal prediction error energy as a cue of vocal dysperiodicity results in an SDR that correlates with the perceived degree of hoarseness. The coefficients of the time-varying long-term linear predictive model are estimated by means of the recursive least squares algorithm. The corpora comprise sustained vowels and French sentences produced by male and female normophonic and dysphonic speakers. A perceptual assessment of speech samples, which rests on comparative judgments, is used to evaluate the ability of the acoustic marker to predict subjective measures of voice quality. Experimental results show that the adaptive approach gives rise to high correlations for sustained vowels as well as for sentences.",44,1-2,61,68,,,Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Least-Squares Analysis; Linear Models; Male; Phonetics; Predictive Value of Tests; Sound Spectrography; Speech Acoustics; Speech Production Measurement; Voice Disorders/diagnosis,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11517-005-0003-3,16929922,10.1007/s11517-005-0003-3,,,0,003-160-755-622-505; 009-525-844-368-999; 013-993-451-192-971; 027-829-918-233-321; 030-367-513-076-625; 039-721-571-193-711; 039-763-449-346-433; 052-464-984-678-270; 060-359-129-566-396; 069-374-371-316-769; 071-761-925-959-339; 072-368-788-309-887; 078-212-546-295-15X; 081-769-251-449-365; 083-722-288-495-992; 085-273-243-915-596; 092-701-687-732-434; 106-164-986-503-75X; 111-284-738-453-236; 133-017-136-224-112; 143-144-572-177-919; 162-007-497-005-313,2

We argue that while effects of single social agents have been corroborated, understanding of persuasion by multiple agents in a group setting is very limited. In the current research, we argue that conformity effects could occur not only with human majorities, but also with artificial majorities consisting of smart agents or computers. Two studies were conducted to investigate the conformity effect of group pressure on participants’ comparative judgments of lengths of lines, based on the classic Asch paradigm. Group pressure by human majorities was compared with pressure by majorities of boxed PC’s and of artificial virtual agents. Results indicated that normative pressure is limited to human majorities, while informational pressure can also be exerted by artificial majorities. This research revealed that applying majorities of artificial agents opens up a new domain of persuasive technology.",,,229,240,Persuasive technology; Asch conformity experiments; Conformity; Psychology; Persuasion; Social agents; Group setting; Normative; Social psychology,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-20306-5_21 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_21 https://core.ac.uk/display/158741175 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Apure.tue.nl%3Apublications%2Fa705d273-4f74-483d-97bd-4efda9a29027 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/persuasive/persuasive2015.html#MiddenHB15 https://research.tue.nl/en/publications/conforming-to-an-artificial-majority-persuasive-effects-of-a-grou,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_21,,10.1007/978-3-319-20306-5_21,850863972,,0,000-177-348-896-455; 019-112-943-140-356; 024-488-175-826-879; 026-646-274-108-972; 033-509-279-368-063; 069-162-130-669-016; 073-892-767-581-299; 079-185-995-330-534; 098-141-871-116-928; 099-942-152-222-106; 108-095-657-267-545; 114-232-124-189-527; 144-690-165-391-71X; 144-818-900-544-226; 189-724-489-757-752,4

Stimulus-based inferences are formed on-line (as information is encountered) using situationally available information, whereas memory-based (or theory-based) inferences are formed using prior knowledge and experience. Inferences can pertain to a single product judged in isolation (a singular judgment context) or to multiple products considered in relation to one another (a comparative judgment context). this2×2×2(Induction vs. Deduction × Stimulus-Based vs. memory-Based × Singular vs. Comparative Judgment) theoretical framework suggests that there are 8 different types of inferences that consumers may form.

Econ. Theory 2, 244–263, 1970) is a classic result in inequality measurement. It establishes Lorenz dominance as a useful criterion for comparative judgements of inequality between distributions. If distribution A Lorenz dominates distribution B, then all indices in a broad class of measures must confirm A as less unequal than B. Recent research, however, shows that standard inequality theory cannot be applied to ordinal data (Zheng Res. Econ. Inequal. 16, 177–188, 2008), such as self-reported health status or educational attainment. A new theory in development (Abul Naga and Yalcin J. Health Econ. 27(6), 1614–1625, 2008) measures disparity of ordinal data as polarization. Typically a criterion used to compare distributions is the polarization relation as proposed by Allison and Foster (J. Health Econ. 23(3), 505–524, 2004).

A pairwise comparison process is used to help individual decision makers make comparative judgements, and a linguistic rating method is used for making absolute judgements. A hierarchical weighting method is developed to assess the weights of a large number of evaluation criteria by pairwise comparisons. To reflect the inherent imprecision of subjective judgements, individual assessments are aggregated as a group assessment using triangular fuzzy numbers. To obtain a cardinal preference value for each decision alternative, a new fuzzy MCDM algorithm is developed by extending the concept of the degree of optimality to incorporate criteria weights in the distance measurement. An empirical study of aircraft selection is presented to illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.",194,2,464,473,Decision support system; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Weighted product model; Weighting; Pairwise comparison; Fuzzy number; Mathematics; Operations research; TOPSIS; Fuzzy logic,,,,,https://researchoutput.ncku.edu.tw/zh/publications/modeling-subjective-evaluation-for-fuzzy-group-multicriteria-deci https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v194y2009i2p464-473.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221708000040 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor194.html#YehC09 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2007.12.029 https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/modeling-subjective-evaluation-for-fuzzy-group-multicriteria-deci http://ir.lib.ncku.edu.tw/handle/987654321/87129 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:ejores:v:194:y:2009:i:2:p:464-473,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2007.12.029,,10.1016/j.ejor.2007.12.029,2076932957,,0,003-596-868-094-515; 007-161-993-237-08X; 007-466-511-367-20X; 009-483-209-549-747; 010-368-651-866-202; 011-243-008-824-510; 018-853-199-800-812; 018-882-942-469-672; 020-710-004-141-989; 023-010-792-867-562; 023-296-729-637-293; 028-454-054-636-147; 029-519-181-104-726; 030-256-740-165-79X; 031-529-466-006-274; 032-909-348-167-81X; 033-151-998-361-69X; 033-906-541-464-413; 034-734-633-852-85X; 037-423-792-391-123; 040-400-211-643-086; 041-366-560-424-383; 048-291-955-168-581; 055-807-088-113-125; 057-025-904-059-46X; 064-745-031-653-679; 067-341-125-020-782; 078-510-882-265-123; 085-168-730-346-111; 086-740-881-812-432; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-893-381-088-488; 089-187-920-020-146; 091-666-780-893-50X; 091-681-693-508-242; 093-253-350-546-927; 096-344-966-222-405; 100-449-039-881-77X; 101-859-588-779-696; 102-075-874-525-735; 103-023-221-405-324; 110-082-778-458-603; 111-315-374-257-355; 113-786-815-699-508; 115-290-912-816-220; 115-343-019-281-266; 122-111-875-781-870; 131-161-724-039-419; 134-895-857-059-677; 138-739-626-233-085; 140-910-018-101-408; 148-434-009-052-401; 161-613-625-488-625; 177-469-549-220-404; 185-988-689-734-014; 187-350-157-372-059; 187-775-764-562-712,147

Abele; Bettina S. Wiese,"Changes in the labour market require people to show more self-management than before if they want to succeed. The present research was conducted to analyse the nomological network of general self-management strategies (i.e. selection of goals; optimization as implementation of goal-pursuing behaviour), specific self-management strategies (i.e. career planning) and central indicators of career success, i.e. objective career success (pay, position), self-referent subjective success (career satisfaction), and other-referent career success (comparative judgment). In a large sample of professionals (N=1,185), we found in support of our hypotheses that the generalized strategy of optimization was linked to the domain-specific strategy of career planning, and that domain-specific career planning was directly linked to all outcome measures. The generalized strategy of optimization was directly linked to subjective success, but only indirectly to objective success. The link from self-management to subjective success was independent of objective success. Most interestingly, and in accord with our social comparison assumption, objective success was more closely linked to other-referent success than to self-referent success.

Baker,"Kraut (Against absolute goodness. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2011) and other neo-Aristotelians have argued that there is no such thing as absolute goodness. They admit only good in a kind, e.g. a good sculptor, and good for something, e.g. good for fish. What is the view of Aristotle? Mostly limiting myself to the Nicomachean Ethics (NE), I argue that Aristotle is committed to things being absolutely good and also to a metaphysics of absolute goodness where there is a maximally best good that is the cause of the goodness of all other things in virtue of being their end. I begin (in Sect. 2) by suggesting that the notion of good as an end, which is present in the first lines of the NE, is not obviously accounted for by good in a kind or good for something. I then give evidence that good in a kind (in Sect. 3) and good for something (in Sect. 4) can explain neither certain distinctions drawn between virtues nor the determinacy ascribed to what is good “in itself.” I argue (in Sect. 5) contra Gotthelf (2012) that because several important arguments in the Nicomachean Ethics rely on comparative judgments of absolute value—e.g. “Man is the best of all animals”—Aristotle is committed to the existence of both absolute goodness and an absolutely best being. I focus (in Sect. 6) on one passage, Aristotle’s division of goods in NE I 12, which presupposes this metaphysical picture.",174,7,1839,1856,Epistemology; Philosophy of language; Philosophy; Axiology; Metaphysics; Philosophy of mind; Sect; Virtue; Determinacy; Teleology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11098-016-0824-y https://philpapers.org/rec/BAKTMO-19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11098-016-0824-y,,10.1007/s11098-016-0824-y,2560519725,,0,006-925-718-889-711; 008-189-750-122-246; 011-360-865-439-759; 019-464-962-269-98X; 030-930-298-524-05X; 033-796-064-465-872; 033-815-585-364-146; 039-233-816-391-773; 047-717-794-121-270; 047-718-427-053-661; 052-076-668-971-884; 059-150-024-591-752; 062-729-347-381-312; 070-444-727-851-647; 079-318-812-169-44X; 082-546-367-850-503; 087-154-174-245-111; 093-093-331-131-128; 097-674-520-383-747; 116-991-766-569-804; 123-429-083-867-816; 127-734-291-427-870; 140-728-170-630-143; 151-763-977-557-242; 155-206-943-703-436; 168-180-538-080-828; 174-404-189-461-880,3

From a mathematical point of view, it is believed that place-value number notation systems, such as the Indo-Arabic numbers, are superior to sign-value systems, such as the Roman numbers. However, sign-value notation might have sufficient efficiency; for example, sign-value notations were common in flourishing cultures, such as in ancient Egypt. Herein we compared artificial sign-value and place-value notations in simple numerical tasks. We found that, contrary to the dominant view, sign-value notation can be applied more easily than place-value notation for multi-power comparison and addition tasks.

This information is generally captured by means of direct scoring, either in the form of a Likert or cardinal scale, or by comparative judgments in pairs or sets. In this sense, the use of pairwise comparisons is becoming increasingly popular because of the simplicity of this experimental procedure. However, this strategy requires non-trivial data analysis to aggregate the comparison ranks into a quality scale and analyse the results, in order to take full advantage of the collected data. This paper explains the process of translating pairwise comparison data into a measurement scale, discusses the benefits and limitations of such scaling methods and introduces a publicly available software in Matlab. We improve on existing scaling methods by introducing outlier analysis, providing methods for computing confidence intervals and statistical testing and introducing a prior, which reduces estimation error when the number of observers is low. Most of our examples focus on image quality assessment.",,,,,Likert scale; Data mining; Pairwise comparison; Software; MATLAB; Computer science; Confidence interval; Image quality; Outlier; Statistical hypothesis testing,,,,,https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686.pdf http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1712.03686 https://aps.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686 https://it.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686 https://arxiv.org/abs/1712.03686 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1712.html#abs-1712-03686,https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/1712.03686,,,2771336083,,0,004-135-383-805-678; 006-571-610-323-702; 014-470-716-101-523; 021-526-803-476-474; 024-523-361-020-538; 025-009-658-071-875; 033-139-527-666-540; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-013-153-822-566; 039-930-844-755-865; 044-391-124-595-817; 056-673-489-196-254; 058-761-128-703-639; 059-943-435-322-573; 063-129-894-317-245; 073-591-412-378-911; 090-794-928-874-330; 091-522-334-493-212; 094-132-462-634-724; 105-342-287-734-148; 112-714-330-059-351; 113-079-030-498-041; 117-341-991-234-105; 123-099-852-938-211; 124-850-148-955-311; 127-473-686-648-632; 129-140-863-196-364; 146-736-854-144-451; 148-738-002-816-897; 154-515-960-293-144; 157-189-775-028-646; 166-585-827-428-918; 167-820-816-060-381; 175-755-079-554-999; 192-305-001-214-263; 196-686-533-213-568,18

Murphy; Declan G. Murphy,"Background: Down’s syndrome (DS) is the most common genetic cause of intellectual disability. People with DS are at an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) compared to the general population. Neuroimaging studies of AD have focused on medial temporal structures; however, to our knowledge, no in vivo case–control study exists comparing the anatomy of dementia in DS to people with AD in the general population. We therefore compared the in vivo brain anatomy of people with DS and dementia (DS+) to those with AD in the general population. Method: Using MRI in 192 adults, we compared the volume of whole brain matter, lateral ventricles, temporal lobes and hippocampus in DS subjects with and without dementia (DS+, DS-), to each other and to three non-DS groups. These included one group of individuals with AD and two groups of controls (each age-matched for their respective DS and general population AD cohorts). Results: AD and DS+ subjects showed significant reductions in the volume of the whole brain, hippocampus and temporal lobes and a significant elevation in the volume of the lateral ventricle, compared to their non-demented counterparts. People with DS+ had a smaller reduction in temporal lobe volume compared to individuals with AD. Conclusions: DS+ and AD subjects have a significant reduction in volume of the same brain regions. We found preliminary evidence that DS individuals may be more sensitive to tissue loss than others and have less ‘cognitive reserve’.",5,1,19,19,Internal medicine; Neuropsychology; Psychology; Cardiology; Neuroscience; Voxel-based morphometry; Dementia; Down syndrome; Lateral ventricles; Temporal lobe; Population; Cognitive reserve,,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2F1866-1955-5-19.pdf https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/622561 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3765707 https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1866-1955-5-19 https://paperity.org/p/55960720/dementia-in-downs-syndrome-an-mri-comparison-with-alzheimers-disease-in-the-general https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/622561 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3765707/ https://www.kcl.ac.uk/ioppn/depts/fans/sackler-group/Publications/Dementia-in-Downs-syndrome---an-MRI-comparison-with-Alzheimes-disease-in-the-general-population.pdf https://jneurodevdisorders.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1866-1955-5-19 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1866-1955-5-19 https://core.ac.uk/display/29932318 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/17169234.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1866-1955-5-19,23962297,10.1186/1866-1955-5-19,2113328288,PMC3765707,0,001-229-679-456-903; 002-421-721-553-114; 003-342-522-654-159; 004-105-837-113-776; 004-693-951-823-177; 004-723-223-485-485; 005-657-629-672-508; 006-939-548-478-334; 009-773-242-304-237; 011-030-837-695-833; 011-386-154-387-740; 011-574-271-455-122; 012-537-519-621-360; 013-682-875-212-421; 014-118-390-880-949; 014-548-664-149-986; 014-986-427-730-662; 016-247-389-808-425; 016-852-399-729-785; 019-322-385-733-063; 020-151-495-923-003; 021-946-244-539-862; 022-734-456-302-594; 023-795-290-727-941; 025-262-892-516-931; 025-395-211-553-93X; 025-727-158-349-080; 026-061-823-650-737; 028-439-266-248-140; 029-362-190-654-225; 032-129-513-254-072; 034-790-298-803-001; 034-997-151-377-157; 035-850-615-703-505; 036-283-968-665-928; 037-875-975-236-430; 038-054-944-959-167; 038-886-963-014-590; 038-946-503-880-051; 039-646-489-702-671; 042-605-495-808-357; 044-545-972-125-18X; 044-707-402-422-00X; 046-021-469-705-510; 046-033-871-986-742; 046-885-869-018-646; 048-536-112-681-339; 048-569-929-890-013; 048-826-757-634-025; 052-038-913-706-447; 053-360-135-195-944; 053-972-827-264-776; 055-233-735-297-515; 056-103-343-180-570; 056-250-711-026-017; 057-521-730-818-78X; 057-951-430-439-614; 058-447-936-385-864; 059-742-984-761-682; 060-948-289-502-477; 062-877-489-316-860; 064-724-443-122-337; 065-402-480-498-83X; 069-206-007-921-935; 073-460-253-804-265; 074-039-777-711-884; 074-087-172-780-015; 074-220-612-786-745; 074-227-623-719-371; 076-229-497-315-270; 079-132-558-226-81X; 079-267-145-757-928; 080-134-421-100-962; 081-064-984-638-470; 081-770-307-806-295; 083-895-854-047-074; 090-686-563-840-112; 091-997-280-232-285; 098-833-861-155-461; 101-560-923-780-090; 105-442-761-699-270; 105-971-825-025-202; 109-434-101-925-995; 109-738-618-605-700; 110-601-621-835-855; 113-386-731-354-163; 120-229-920-774-487; 122-160-178-477-647; 125-200-548-481-516; 126-562-521-271-521; 126-975-748-261-737; 131-756-174-644-245; 133-912-088-492-278; 135-860-322-978-438; 140-835-372-987-662; 141-335-715-571-075; 141-905-761-253-547; 145-050-694-943-349; 151-623-823-820-840; 159-425-833-861-957; 160-675-178-329-530; 161-667-804-995-781; 163-614-125-673-899; 163-905-206-331-276; 172-645-145-938-637; 176-172-680-065-610; 190-866-092-061-297; 194-737-270-589-671; 197-898-598-915-000,18

Birney; Jens F. Beckmann; Yuan-Zhi Seah,"Judging creativity accurately is difficult. Individuals who are involved in product creation tend to overestimate the creativity of their work; individuals not involved lack understanding of the creative process that led to the product under scrutiny. We studied creativity judgements in a tripartite person–task–situation framework. Under high, medium, or no structure conditions and different orders of evaluation, participants (N = 90) rated the creativity and purchase appeal of products created by themselves and others. Accuracy was defined as differences from consensus evaluations of participants not involved in production (N = 30). Moderator analyses suggest that externally set structure of the evaluation process (e.g., using a set of criteria) facilitates the quality of creativity judgement. In unstructured conditions, evaluating one's own product before evaluating a peer's leads to low accuracy, but higher levels of conscientiousness seem to mitigate potentially deleterious effects of lack of structure. Higher levels of openness facilitated accurate creativity judgements of peer-produced products, but not self-produced products. A person–task–situation approach is needed to fully unpack the complexity of processes underlying accurate evaluation of creativity.",51,,400,408,Creativity; Psychology; Conscientiousness; Scrutiny; Judgement; Appeal; Creativity technique; Social psychology; Openness to experience; Moderation,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608015001430 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608015001430 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/16053/ https://core.ac.uk/display/42127112 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42127112.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2015.07.007,,10.1016/j.lindif.2015.07.007,1112876375,,0,000-855-415-234-92X; 005-680-803-306-411; 007-778-725-444-103; 009-199-607-509-945; 011-691-603-990-563; 012-419-306-168-454; 013-144-338-906-307; 013-844-158-495-691; 014-100-582-168-838; 014-550-385-887-831; 019-494-592-992-00X; 023-211-814-605-805; 024-300-957-459-148; 024-486-655-201-668; 024-677-886-067-55X; 024-904-596-368-351; 031-918-526-492-032; 032-710-173-388-769; 035-269-926-589-309; 037-206-867-760-448; 038-900-943-669-926; 039-140-564-871-566; 039-814-284-598-946; 040-685-365-982-12X; 046-835-621-503-482; 046-916-475-700-705; 047-126-405-642-861; 056-595-986-903-000; 056-624-909-654-434; 057-499-611-254-098; 065-076-348-797-073; 072-081-979-800-099; 077-342-166-218-995; 081-679-198-699-277; 088-772-520-287-23X; 090-540-617-516-333; 101-443-312-067-701; 105-808-499-122-292; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 115-926-851-944-210; 119-802-222-348-425; 135-042-926-508-977; 138-609-640-157-052; 142-562-898-860-043; 143-251-737-656-744; 147-266-862-292-625; 147-683-236-633-135; 148-546-445-222-290; 155-083-994-281-045; 167-740-249-839-996,14

Tibber; Gemma S.L. Manasseh; Richard Charles Clarke; Galina Gagin; Sonja N. Swanbeck; Brian Butterworth; R. Beau Lotto; Steven C. Dakin,"Sensitivity to visual numerosity has previously been shown to predict human mathematical performance. However, it is not clear whether it is discrimination of numerosity per se that is predictive of mathematical ability, or whether the association is driven by more general task demands. To test this notion we had over 300 participants (ranging in age from 6 to 73 years) perform a symbolic mathematics test and 4 different visuospatial matching tasks. The visual tasks involved matching 2 clusters of Gabor elements for their numerosity, density, size or orientation by a method of adjustment. Partial correlation and regression analyses showed that sensitivity to visual numerosity, sensitivity to visual orientation and mathematical education level predict a significant proportion of shared as well as unique variance in mathematics scores.

It is considered as a potential solution to the prevailing shortage of fossil fuel and environmental challenges. However, in most parts of Africa including Ethiopia, traditional land allocation systems for biodiesel investment do not involve integration of multiple variables. This research tries to introduce the advantages of Geographical Information Systems (GIS) and Spatial Analytical Hierarchy Process (SAHP) to identify suitable areas for jatropha production in Ethiopia. Combination of these methods enables integration of different environmental data in a multi-criteria analysis. The study will provide basic information in the biodiesel investment, which has been susceptible to failure due to poor land allocation. The methods used in this study will also be available for similar endeavors in the future. Results: In general, although individual factor evaluations provided varying amounts of suitability, results of weighted overlay analysis for biophysical suitability evaluation using spatial modeling methods identified 15.07% (166,082 km 2 ), 76.57% (844,040 km 2 ) and 8.36% (92114 km 2 ) of the land as highly suitable, moderately suitable and not suitable for jatropha production, respectively. Conclusion: The methods used in this study provided considerably reliable estimate of suitable sites for jatropha production in Ethiopia. In this study, the main limiting factors of jatropha production identified were elevation, climate (temperature and rainfall extremities) and water logging conditions. Suitable sites do not compete with existing land use systems ensuring that biodiesel production will not risk food security programs.",3,1,25,,Suitability analysis; Environmental data; Jatropha curcas; Jatropha; Environmental science; Land use; Biodiesel; Food security; Agronomy; Analytic hierarchy process; Agricultural engineering,,,,,http://www.environmentalsystemsresearch.com/content/3/1/25 https://paperity.org/p/58926787/suitability-analysis-for-jatropha-curcas-production-in-ethiopia-a-spatial-modeling https://environmentalsystemsresearch.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7 https://core.ac.uk/display/81888017 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7/fulltext.html?view=classic https://environmentalsystemsresearch.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81888017.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7,,10.1186/s40068-014-0025-7,2138957106,,0,005-080-004-184-770; 005-883-081-567-694; 008-278-112-244-075; 009-881-393-198-900; 014-004-497-934-50X; 015-646-262-656-008; 016-049-513-563-166; 018-847-554-663-875; 034-763-453-364-392; 047-807-802-610-306; 052-313-346-763-085; 052-890-333-311-549; 053-702-332-528-186; 059-857-586-076-540; 062-329-039-166-896; 063-932-094-734-115; 064-036-288-336-458; 067-641-731-319-447; 067-962-985-850-198; 074-917-257-487-379; 082-121-389-872-945; 091-661-515-540-524; 092-276-767-500-559; 110-284-323-085-623; 111-346-566-249-896; 113-908-302-066-206; 128-482-207-848-153; 129-932-503-927-253; 133-440-302-496-77X; 138-349-171-316-04X; 140-608-175-084-069; 143-788-274-313-090; 147-337-371-817-293; 167-686-530-456-845; 172-737-984-804-064; 175-323-029-210-347; 176-541-047-223-979; 185-272-154-510-109; 195-372-342-086-457,8

Cortes; Bryce G. Leka,"It is widely believed that a Two-Alternative-Forced-Choice (2AFC) in an old/new recognition memory test is made by comparing the two items and choosing the item with the higher strength. For this reason, it is considered to be criterion-free by some researchers. We found evidence that subjects probabilistically compromised the comparison by choosing the left item when they recognized it as old. Using both normal test pairs (comprised of one new and one old item) and two types of null pairs (comprised of both-new or both-old items), we found that a left-biased choice was coupled with higher hit and false alarm rates and a shorter left than right-choice RT for the normal pairs, consistent with the hypothesis of a bias for making a choice on the basis of a left individual-item recognition. For the null pairs, RT was much longer for the both-new than for the both-old pairs, providing additional evidence for basing decision on an individual-item's absolute, rather than a relative, familiarity. Additionally, subjects gave higher confidence ratings to choices for the both-old than the normal and both-new pairs, again suggesting that their decision was based on absolute familiarity of the items. The results were found to be not due to a fast-response instruction. A comparative judgment experiment in which subjects chose the item higher or lower in an attribute magnitude did not show the response side bias and RT asymmetry. The presence of bias in the former, and the absence of it in the latter can be explained by a weak versus strong relational judgment in the former and the latter type of 2AFC, respectively. We discuss the implications these findings have for the use of the 2AFC as a method for testing recognition memory.",167,,30,44,Two-alternative forced choice; Psychology; Response bias; Cognitive psychology; False alarm; Recognition memory test; Response side; Space perception; Asymmetry; Social psychology; Recognition memory,2AFC recognition; Criterion in recognition memory; Null test items in 2AFC; Old/new 2AFC versus comparative judgment; Two-alternative-forced-choice,"Choice Behavior; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Recognition, Psychology/physiology; Space Perception; Task Performance and Analysis; Young Adult",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27104925 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691816300580,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2016.03.014,27104925,10.1016/j.actpsy.2016.03.014,2342187568,,0,002-483-813-741-677; 004-165-239-429-599; 005-374-265-419-666; 005-802-122-303-98X; 015-010-064-854-173; 016-333-888-925-627; 016-906-442-298-759; 021-150-247-428-267; 023-097-154-656-861; 023-902-548-706-226; 025-527-634-062-130; 025-640-854-205-361; 026-161-860-569-805; 028-640-345-079-319; 029-423-356-713-974; 029-915-293-337-721; 032-405-497-897-091; 032-979-572-685-682; 037-150-919-406-548; 037-206-981-914-367; 040-298-816-767-876; 051-635-482-462-434; 055-028-431-016-662; 055-199-004-736-063; 056-600-005-793-064; 057-067-078-913-358; 058-571-827-675-115; 058-867-511-166-667; 062-316-891-621-310; 063-977-013-577-779; 065-031-522-530-157; 065-661-157-644-821; 065-684-998-169-369; 071-973-141-544-877; 079-395-919-354-820; 083-745-639-866-460; 097-855-252-586-558; 108-992-385-700-703; 109-926-662-069-886; 111-291-448-643-846; 117-912-241-618-384; 124-713-800-684-815; 131-215-689-299-346; 133-817-156-511-35X; 139-708-795-933-36X; 143-286-713-202-617; 147-360-774-999-912; 159-194-489-256-073; 163-227-012-804-91X; 176-017-510-665-867; 177-226-574-421-404; 199-055-961-488-187,9

Flynn,"Abstract Employees at all organizational levels have influence over their subordinates, their colleagues, and even their bosses. But are they aware of this influence? We present evidence suggesting that employees are constrained by cognitive biases that lead them to underestimate their influence over others in the workplace. As a result of this underestimation of influence, employees may be reluctant to spearhead organizational change, discount their own role in subordinates’ performance failures, and fail to speak up in the face of wrongdoing. In addition to reviewing evidence for this bias, we propose five moderators that, when present, may reverse or attenuate the underestimation effect (namely, comparative judgments, the objectification or dehumanization of an influence target, the actual degree of influence any one influencer has, the means of influence, and culture). Finally, we offer some practical solutions to help employees more fully recognize their influence over other members of the organization.",33,,97,112,Social influence; Psychology; Egocentrism; Cognitive bias; Wrongdoing; Objectification; Perspective-taking; Organizational change; Dehumanization; Social psychology,,,,,https://digitalcommons.ilr.cornell.edu/articles/1057/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019130851300004X https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S019130851300004X https://core.ac.uk/display/33618627,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.riob.2013.10.002,,10.1016/j.riob.2013.10.002,2095468191,,0,000-094-696-244-804; 000-956-208-102-978; 002-043-931-530-695; 002-432-249-945-635; 004-048-495-317-411; 004-235-529-354-127; 004-502-447-528-115; 004-612-586-717-319; 005-245-406-245-356; 005-728-712-562-786; 006-103-245-500-549; 006-456-097-190-780; 007-005-801-348-021; 007-170-846-744-203; 007-335-269-811-981; 008-654-915-629-40X; 008-847-414-702-913; 009-080-568-799-258; 009-813-572-712-755; 010-278-410-031-678; 011-416-965-015-873; 013-607-207-066-633; 014-760-386-818-331; 015-283-207-966-812; 015-723-771-940-433; 016-253-770-950-333; 016-566-904-426-762; 016-585-925-105-806; 016-812-713-548-418; 017-076-317-707-986; 017-721-067-492-650; 018-644-852-305-814; 018-797-159-529-542; 019-631-864-615-944; 019-951-111-569-958; 020-419-379-272-121; 021-021-272-761-642; 022-543-178-698-696; 023-069-601-334-71X; 023-370-733-072-11X; 023-639-356-479-473; 024-015-617-482-314; 024-358-034-230-291; 025-045-754-512-595; 026-048-764-345-348; 029-556-440-582-275; 030-207-912-550-758; 030-348-394-775-891; 032-996-468-959-780; 035-523-929-202-879; 036-142-684-033-76X; 038-051-584-678-164; 038-204-119-115-889; 038-570-681-019-86X; 038-615-599-788-623; 039-250-980-358-654; 039-424-607-471-63X; 040-041-952-404-371; 041-182-224-198-966; 041-402-817-083-330; 042-178-112-531-343; 043-157-231-777-171; 043-461-975-829-006; 044-571-678-980-184; 046-016-426-846-464; 046-747-777-093-408; 046-891-125-275-544; 047-330-353-865-913; 047-515-631-688-269; 047-592-088-095-734; 049-554-379-386-131; 050-251-793-298-708; 050-460-807-207-274; 051-070-761-029-38X; 051-892-608-564-24X; 052-728-157-288-953; 054-162-090-154-522; 054-547-793-256-549; 057-900-667-227-636; 058-274-039-249-94X; 058-340-296-826-464; 059-317-218-549-933; 059-540-385-694-769; 059-984-299-888-53X; 060-273-009-237-742; 060-452-900-118-236; 060-543-037-631-058; 061-957-289-547-350; 063-395-321-623-001; 063-484-710-617-291; 063-601-994-876-892; 065-417-026-651-744; 065-677-868-374-318; 065-688-149-501-185; 067-652-950-258-705; 067-909-922-647-974; 068-537-701-638-590; 069-886-494-745-466; 071-522-565-190-205; 072-066-134-550-301; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-645-566-983-887; 073-388-009-690-637; 073-971-901-803-450; 073-983-376-505-700; 075-092-797-115-026; 075-226-257-090-527; 075-381-506-603-208; 075-513-030-539-280; 075-593-787-158-52X; 079-859-316-521-290; 080-413-174-332-978; 081-254-529-775-841; 081-315-675-613-994; 082-204-321-941-071; 082-641-414-527-182; 082-662-120-833-072; 084-197-742-745-570; 084-597-983-750-509; 086-845-828-387-60X; 087-281-211-445-916; 091-976-601-050-763; 093-682-864-912-168; 094-496-112-515-140; 097-222-075-963-403; 097-540-793-412-714; 104-004-608-176-127; 104-062-302-899-395; 104-619-461-712-589; 104-982-902-860-728; 105-583-418-831-173; 107-913-751-778-208; 108-095-657-267-545; 109-777-199-407-655; 109-786-950-838-369; 111-659-884-856-63X; 114-903-370-959-050; 117-574-767-580-553; 118-240-137-569-487; 121-597-521-098-819; 127-457-663-042-101; 134-757-936-365-765; 134-767-109-080-503; 140-466-941-520-085; 140-702-908-025-279; 141-088-135-392-120; 141-694-423-379-764; 142-888-532-139-657; 145-330-707-583-36X; 154-888-297-907-649; 158-330-807-917-824; 158-714-440-438-159; 162-769-668-297-527; 162-975-982-787-185; 163-514-755-440-434; 165-020-820-721-148; 166-356-468-021-796; 167-740-793-705-289; 169-224-769-877-912; 170-800-981-851-021; 171-346-165-586-695; 173-053-816-284-257; 184-716-560-285-97X; 186-585-148-864-158; 188-876-569-103-050; 197-151-224-677-129,10

An evaluation model combined fuzzy theory with analytic hierarchy process and the law of comparative judgment was presented. Discovery architecture of networked manufacturing resources was built. Basic principles and characteristics of the integrated architecture were analyzed. Key technologies for realizing the integrated architecture were studied. The joint discovery mechanism prototype platform for manufacturing resource was developed by borrowing ideas from this model.

Y. Li; S. Thomas Ng; Martin Skitmore,"AbstractMajor infrastructure and construction (MIC) projects are those with significant traffic or environmental impact, of strategic and regional significance and high sensitivity. The decision-making process of schemes of this type is becoming ever more complicated, especially with the increasing number of stakeholders involved and their growing tendency to defend their own varied interests. Failing to address and meet the concerns and expectations of stakeholders may result in project failures. To avoid this necessitates a systematic participatory approach to facilitate decision making. Though numerous decision models have been established in previous studies (e.g., ELECTRE methods, the analytic hierarchy process and analytic network process) their applicability in the decision process during stakeholder participation in contemporary MIC projects is still uncertain. To resolve this, the decision rule approach is employed for modeling multi-stakeholder multi-objective project decisions.

Pairwise comparison matrices (PCM) have been applied for ranking criteria and for scoring alternatives according to a given criterion. Our paper presents a special application of incomplete PCMs: ranking of professional tennis players based on their results against each other. The selected 25 players have been on the top of the ATP rankings for a shorter or longer period in the last 40 years. Some of them have never met on the court. One of the aims of the paper is to provide ranking of the selected players, however, the analysis of incomplete pairwise comparison matrices is also in the focus. The eigenvector method and the logarithmic least squares method were used to calculate weights from incomplete PCMs. In our results the top three players of four decades were Nadal, Federer and Sampras.

In particular, we manipulated penalties for errors and slow responses in a speeded categorization task. The data show improved performance for monetary over symbolic rewards only for a payoff scheme comprising higher penalties for slow responses than for errors. Conversely, payoff schemes with stronger punishment for errors than for slow responses resulted in impaired performance for monetary rewards. The results suggest that an emphasis of speed is favorable for positive influences of monetary incentives, whereas an emphasis of accuracy under time pressure has the opposite effect.",2,,248,248,Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Stochastic game; Incentive; Perceptual decision; Improved performance; Time pressure; Social psychology; Categorization,attentional effort; flanker task; monetary reward; speed–accuracy tradeoff,,,,https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/handle/123456789/16125 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00248/full http://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/123456789/16125/2/Dambacher%20etal.pdf https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/123456789/16125/2/Dambacher%20etal.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3180172/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3180172 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00248/abstract https://kops.uni-konstanz.de/bitstream/handle/123456789/16125/Dambacher%20etal.pdf;sequence=2 https://core.ac.uk/display/25891549 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82855724.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00248,21980316,10.3389/fpsyg.2011.00248,2139942553,PMC3180172,0,010-451-104-746-233; 019-533-558-250-343; 019-856-024-616-343; 020-165-778-666-665; 022-513-574-133-227; 026-094-806-143-988; 029-417-129-823-996; 031-080-720-277-356; 032-905-474-283-59X; 035-764-593-157-53X; 041-659-281-349-623; 041-670-949-756-948; 044-924-177-090-467; 050-275-649-420-39X; 050-849-474-729-845; 050-948-703-592-234; 061-522-471-151-43X; 064-011-467-160-880; 072-965-133-166-219; 073-317-026-548-992; 074-540-101-352-673; 075-458-849-116-850; 085-539-592-965-538; 092-496-909-675-421; 102-020-415-919-315; 107-321-681-417-685; 108-935-338-491-645; 109-774-117-410-882; 114-251-883-659-335; 132-100-364-569-455; 175-817-209-182-064,18

We developed a web-based two-step approach as follows: (1) for the first step, we used the multi-attribute analysis method using the AHP (analytic hierarchy process); and (2) for the second step we, used fuzzy set ranking methodologies to integrate the special decision problems that are problems involving multi-objectives, multi-criteria, and multi-attributes. We propose a procedure for integrating the comparative judgments and priorities for make-or-buy decisions and for the optimal resource allocation. First, we determine the rank-ordered priority lists of the projects based on the AHP, and then we compute the aggregate fuzzy set rank order. Finally, we develop a systematic and practical program for a simple and easy calculation of all the algorithms used in this study. It is found that the proposed model can be validated by comparative computations in various make-or-buy example problems for a cellular manufacturing system.",46,7,1081,1090,Decision problem; Ranking; Cellular manufacturing; Decision theory; Resource allocation; Mathematics; Fuzzy set; Operations research; Decision model; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://www.isahp.org/2005Proceedings/Papers/Hwang_Web-BasedModelForMakeOrBuyDecisions.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717707000878 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/mcm/mcm46.html#HwangKG07 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.mcm.2007.03.021,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0895717707000878,,,2009729358,,0,029-482-942-367-015; 041-181-089-780-050; 043-509-047-046-906; 050-394-841-529-143; 052-350-646-390-666; 067-341-125-020-782; 079-840-303-805-059; 080-471-518-301-637; 093-888-371-798-938; 107-481-648-776-961; 121-006-478-621-75X; 131-306-723-297-98X; 138-451-222-351-648; 170-790-251-883-084; 177-469-549-220-404,21

In addition to the TPB factors, we took into account the following factors: past behavior, sensation seeking, comparative judgment of risk, and – taken from the Prototype Willingness Model ( Gibbons and Gerrard, 1995 ) – self-descriptions, typical-deviant descriptions and perceived similarity to the typical deviant. Sample A questionnaire survey was conducted on 3002 drivers ages 18–25. They were distinguished according to gender and driving experience (time since obtaining driver’s license): novices (less than 1 year), beginners (1 year to less than 3 years), and more experienced drivers (3 years or more). Results and discussion Determinants of the intention to speed were mostly attitude, normative variables, and past behavior. The regression model explained 72% of the variance. Men had a slightly higher intention to speed than did women. The impact of sensation seeking and injunctive norms was stronger on men’s intention to speed, whereas self-descriptions variables had a greater impact on women’s intention. Speeding intention increased with driving experience. The influence of sensation seeking was stronger among the novices, normative influence was stronger for the beginners, and perceived behavioral control had the greatest impact among the more experienced drivers.

In different industrial sectors like cosmetics, textiles and automotive, special-effect pigments are largely used to achieve attractive visual features. These pigments provide a color change with viewing and illumination direction, and visually provide texture. Depending on a finish’s properties, and also on the viewing and illumination conditions, coatings exhibit sparkle or a graininess-like texture. Currently, not many scientific works on the visual perception of these texture effects can be found in the literature. In addition, choice of experimental method can influence the measurement scale obtained from visual data. For this reason, the purpose of this work was to analyze graininess visual scaling constructed by two different psychophysical methods. The experimental design was based on the rank-order and paired-comparison methods. The data analysis was conducted by following the law of comparative judgments to obtain a visual scale of the graininess attribute to compare it to instrumental data. A good correlation appeared between both magnitudes with a correlation coefficient close to 0.9. Both methods provided useful results with a reasonable correspondence between them, which ensures that data can be considered reliable, while the visual obtained scale can act as a good graininess scale perceived by the human visual system.",10,4,316,,Psychophysics; Artificial intelligence; Human visual system model; Visual appearance; Visual perception; Materials science; Correlation coefficient; Visual scale; Computer vision; Scaling,,,,European Association of National Metrology Institutes,http://rua.ua.es/dspace/handle/10045/104787 https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/10/4/316/pdf http://rua.ua.es/dspace/bitstream/10045/104787/1/Perales_etal_2020_Coatings.pdf https://www.mdpi.com/2079-6412/10/4/316,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/coatings10040316,,10.3390/coatings10040316,3012994770,,0,007-526-301-579-070; 011-024-285-816-420; 012-579-494-160-486; 013-873-336-560-998; 028-600-184-401-058; 032-314-915-043-934; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-431-382-315-670; 070-441-622-172-679; 074-268-984-893-683; 117-824-057-388-195; 118-365-676-259-575,0

Zahedi; L. V. Cremades,"Multi-criteria decision-making methods support decision makers in all stages of the decision-making process by providing useful data. However, criteria are not always certain as uncertainty is a feature of the real world. MCDM methods under uncertainty and fuzzy systems are accepted as suitable techniques in conflicting problems that cannot be represented by numerical values, in particular in energy analysis and planning. In this paper, a modified TOPSIS method for multi-criteria group decision-making with qualitative linguistic labels is proposed. This method addresses uncertainty considering different levels of precision. Each decision maker’s judgment on the performance of alternatives with respect to each criterion is expressed by qualitative linguistic labels. The new method takes into account linguistic data provided by the decision makers without any previous aggregation. Decision maker judgments are incorporated into the proposed method to generate a complete ranking of alternatives. An application in energy planning is presented as an illustrative case example in which energy policy alternatives are ranked. Seven energy alternatives under nine criteria were evaluated according to the opinion of three environmental and energy experts.

As such, these decisions require fast access to relative information. Therefore, we expect that signatures of the comparative process should be observable in electrophysiological components at an early stage of information processing. However, to date, little is known about the neural time course of social target comparisons. Therefore, we tested this hypothesis in two electroencephalography (EEG) studies using a social distance effect paradigm. The distance effect capitalizes on the fact that stimuli close on a certain dimension take longer to compare than stimuli clearly differing on this dimension. Here, we manipulated the distance of face characteristics regarding their levels of attractiveness (Study 1) and trustworthiness (Study 2), two essential social dimensions. In both studies, size comparisons served as a nonsocial control condition. In Study 1, distance related effects were apparent 170 milliseconds (VPP) and 200 milliseconds (N2) after stimulus onset for attractiveness comparisons. In Study 2, trustworthiness comparisons took effect already after 100 milliseconds (N1) and likewise carried over to an event-related N2. Remarkably, we observed a similar temporal pattern for social (attractiveness, trustworthiness) and nonsocial (size) dimensions. These results speak in favor of an early encoding of comparative information and emphasize the primary role of comparison in social information processing",,,,,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76979138.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xge0000222.supp,,10.1037/xge0000222.supp,,,0,,0

Blume,"Operability is a driving requirement for next generation space launch vehicles. Launch site ground operations include numerous operator tasks to prepare the vehicle for launch or to perform preflight maintenance. Ensuring that components requiring operator interaction at the launch site are designed for optimal human use is a high priority for operability. To promote operability, a Design Quality Evaluation Survey based on Universal Design framework was developed to support Human Factors Engineering (HFE) evaluation for NASA s launch vehicles. Universal Design per se is not a priority for launch vehicle processing however; applying principles of Universal Design will increase the probability of an error free and efficient design which promotes operability. The Design Quality Evaluation Survey incorporates and tailors the seven Universal Design Principles and adds new measures for Safety and Efficiency. Adapting an approach proven to measure Universal Design Performance in Product, each principle is associated with multiple performance measures which are rated with the degree to which the statement is true. The Design Quality Evaluation Survey was employed for several launch vehicle ground processing worksite analyses. The tool was found to be most useful for comparative judgments as opposed to an assessment of a single design option. It provided a useful piece of additional data when assessing possible operator interfaces or worksites for operability.",,,,,Operability; Engineering; Automotive engineering; Systems engineering; Crew; Launch vehicle; Design analysis; Human use; Operator (computer programming); Space launch; Universal design,,,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20100032977.pdf https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/250612,http://dx.doi.org/10.2514/6.2010-6280,,10.2514/6.2010-6280,2086519946,,0,008-208-412-087-872; 059-771-060-588-35X; 123-167-054-040-302; 129-468-987-441-631,0

Merkle,"Comparative measures such as paired comparisons and rankings are frequently used to evaluate health states and quality of life. The present article introduces log-linear Bradley-Terry (LLBT) models to evaluate intervention effectiveness when outcomes are measured as paired comparisons or rankings and presents a combination of the LLBT model and model-based recursive partitioning (MOB) to detect treatment effect heterogeneity. The MOB LLBT approach enables researchers to identify subgroups that differ in the preference order and in the effect an intervention has on choice behavior. Applicability of MOB LLBT models is demonstrated using an artificial data example with known data-generating mechanism and a real-world data example focusing on drug-harm perception among music festival visitors. In the artificial data example, the MOB LLBT model is able to adequately recover the ""true"" (population) model. In the real-world data example, the standard LLBT model confirms the existence of a situational willingness among festival visitors to trivialize drug harm when peer consumption behavior is made cognitively accessible. In addition, MOB LLBT results suggest that this trivialization effect is highly context-dependent and most pronounced for participants with low-to-moderate alcohol intoxication who also proactively contacted a substance counselor at the festival venue. Both data examples suggest that MOB LLBT models allow for more nuanced statements about the effectiveness of interventions. We provide R code examples to implement MOB LLBT models for paired comparisons, rankings, and rating (Likert-type) data.",,,1,11,Recursive partitioning; Health psychology; Psychology; Perception; Psychological intervention; Music festival; Bradley–Terry model; Population; Applied psychology; Situational ethics,Bradley Terry model; Paired comparisons; Rankings; Recursive partitioning; Treatment effect heterogeneity,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11121-021-01212-z https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s11121-021-01212-z.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11121-021-01212-z,33687608,10.1007/s11121-021-01212-z,3134074180,,0,004-107-553-174-752; 006-648-861-864-354; 008-148-883-130-660; 008-400-306-798-435; 011-105-391-999-886; 011-993-023-817-311; 012-654-489-792-03X; 014-454-783-407-266; 016-009-815-366-68X; 016-173-243-000-192; 022-318-447-805-808; 028-298-903-484-861; 030-252-252-226-604; 030-405-062-123-57X; 031-463-078-174-314; 031-779-699-577-483; 032-312-204-263-405; 034-020-838-098-577; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-268-042-941-846; 037-987-633-168-593; 040-266-203-768-52X; 041-656-251-943-572; 041-706-379-743-767; 041-960-325-536-82X; 042-262-850-601-237; 044-543-500-382-496; 045-013-816-409-251; 046-031-361-115-753; 047-613-017-049-773; 047-711-680-550-387; 049-043-712-126-540; 050-209-265-352-054; 052-962-786-280-925; 061-197-152-305-976; 066-718-263-808-78X; 078-108-246-951-872; 085-685-156-527-975; 085-821-774-217-222; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-201-920-223-38X; 098-583-005-710-291; 108-572-835-690-67X; 108-784-569-028-003; 108-834-791-228-404; 109-123-055-173-252; 122-376-674-983-517; 127-473-686-648-632; 128-953-148-962-818; 134-050-084-268-981; 140-567-304-535-180; 163-623-899-437-253,0

Aylward; B.J. van Wyk; Yskandar Hamam,"This paper introduces a new methodology to assist teaching and learning in a time-constrained environment at the hand of two time-on-task examples. These examples are from the field of Electrical Engineering studies with a focus on first- year studies and an advanced software design course taught at the Tshwane University of Technology in South Africa. In an endeavour to understand the timing model of the human brain to master and assimilate new information, a study was conducted to determine some of the parameters that could possibly have an influence on the timing model and how the brain perceives new information. From this study the Rope-Weaver's Principles were derived and are built on three well-known theories, comparative judgment, the Guttman scale and the learning curve, integrated into the new methodology. The Rope-Weaver's Principles are presented as an abstraction of the mathematical principles and the measures that underpin this study. The research was done from a participant-observer perspective with design research as central methodology. The research methodology involved a longitudinal study employing mixed-methods research. The results led to the observation of a toe or plateau in the infancy of the learning curve. The observed plateau has a direct influence on the order and time frame of the introduction of new study material in a formal educational programme. The results were found to adhere to the Weber-Fechner Law. This relates to other studies on animals, suggesting that the way the brain perceives stimuli or assimilate knowledge is hard-wired throughout the animal kingdom although the brain structures vary widely. It is proposed that Rope-Weaver's Principles, complementary to the current pool of teaching and learning theories, lead to a better mastery of the learning material or skills, moving persons under instruction from rule based training – behaviourism, to maxim integration – constructivism.",110,4,190,208,Constructivism (philosophy of education); Abstraction; Mathematics education; Rule-based system; Research design; Learning curve; Computer science; Software design; Learning theory; Guttman scale,,,,,https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8864146,http://dx.doi.org/10.23919/saiee.2019.8864146,,10.23919/saiee.2019.8864146,2980218484,,0,,0

Makhijani,"There is a growing need for discrete choice models that account for the complex nature of human choices, escaping traditional behavioral assumptions such as the transitivity of pairwise preferences. Recently, several parametric models of intransitive comparisons have been proposed, but in all cases the maximum likelihood problem is non-concave, making inference difficult. In this work we generalize this trend, showing that there cannot exist any parametric model with a concave log-likelihood function that can exhibit intransitive preferences. Given this result, we motivate a new model for analyzing intransitivity in pairwise comparisons, taking inspiration from the Condorcet method (majority vote) in social choice theory. The Majority Vote model we analyze is defined as a voting process over independent Random Utility Models (RUMs). We infer a multidimensional embedding of each object or player, in contrast to the traditional one-dimensional embedding used by models such as the Thurstone or Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) models. We show that a three-dimensional majority vote model is capable of modeling arbitrarily strong and long intransitive cycles, and can also represent arbitrary pairwise comparison probabilities on any triplet. We provide experimental results that substantiate our claims regarding the effectiveness of our model in capturing intransitivity for various pairwise choice tasks such as predicting choices in recommendation systems, winners in online video games, and elections.",,,,,Condorcet method; Mathematical economics; Majority rule; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Social choice theory; Discrete choice; Inference; Intransitivity; Computer science,,,,,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02518.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1810.02518 https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.02518,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1810.02518.pdf,,,2895707750,,0,,0

Abstract With English-language readers as participants, in an experiment requiring pair-wise comparative judgments of numerical magnitude, typical SNARC effects were obtained. With comparisons of the remembered size of animals, SNARC depended on the direction of the instruction. In both cases the continua are organized from left to right corresponding to the direction of reading. On the other hand, with Hebrew- and Arabic-language readers, exactly the same configuration of findings was obtained except that the spatial direction in each domain was reversed; the mental continua are organized from right to left corresponding again to the direction of reading. The Present Experiments: Overview In one set of experiments, we employ English-language readers (i.e., people who read from left to right). In the next, we employ Israeli and Palestinian participants who read from right to left, with a view toward determining if the form of SNARC effect is language - direction of reading - dependent. In each case, in one set of conditions, we require comparisons of numerical magnitude, and in another, we require comparisons of the remembered sizes of animals, with a view toward determining whether SNARC effects also occur with symbolic, non-numerical continua.

Introduction Experiment 1: Robust SNARC Effects in Numerical Comparisons – English Readers There is substantial evidence in support of the claim that psychologically, numbers are represented on a mental number line, with both spatial and extensive components. The most striking, indeed landmark, demonstration of a spatial component in the mental representation of the number line was obtained by Dehaene, Bossini, and Giraux (1993) in the context of a parity judgment task. They found that responses with the left hand were faster than those with the right hand when the numbers were relatively small (e.g., 1 and 2). On the other hand, when the numbers were relatively large (e.g., 8 and 9), responses were faster with the right hand than with the left hand. The authors argued than small numbers are represented on the left end of the number line and become positively associated with the leftward responses. Similarly, because relatively large numbers are located on the right of the number line they tend to preferentially elicit rightward responses. Dehaene et al. labeled their A further purpose of this experiment was to determine how the instructions are presented might influence the SNARC effect. In particular, using a within-participants design, in one condition the instructions randomly varied from trial to trial (randomized) and in the other condition they remained constant over a block of trials (blocked). As well, an additional purpose was to determine if the SNARC effect in any way depended on the direction of the comparison. For comparisons involving pairs of positive and negative numbers, Shaki and Petrusic (2005) had previously found approximately comparable SNARC effects with the two possible forms of the instructions.",31,31,,,Psychology; Negative number; Cognitive psychology; Right-to-left; Spatial representation; Mental number line; Spatial direction; Social psychology; Number line; Mental representation; Correlation and dependence,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/019912j6,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/019912j6,,,2767513083,,0,015-715-023-202-849; 029-915-293-337-721; 039-569-462-353-364; 084-421-364-199-245,1

088-510-290-446-96X,Interactive machine learning for health informatics: when do we need the human-in-the-loop?,2016-03-02,2016,journal article,Brain informatics,21984018; 21984026,Springer Science and Business Media LLC,Germany,Andreas Holzinger,"Machine learning (ML) is the fastest growing field in computer science, and health informatics is among the greatest challenges. The goal of ML is to develop algorithms which can learn and improve over time and can be used for predictions. Most ML researchers concentrate on automatic machine learning (aML), where great advances have been made, for example, in speech recognition, recommender systems, or autonomous vehicles. Automatic approaches greatly benefit from big data with many training sets. However, in the health domain, sometimes we are confronted with a small number of data sets or rare events, where aML-approaches suffer of insufficient training samples. Here interactive machine learning (iML) may be of help, having its roots in reinforcement learning, preference learning, and active learning. The term iML is not yet well used, so we define it as “algorithms that can interact with agents and can optimize their learning behavior through these interactions, where the agents can also be human.” This “human-in-the-loop” can be beneficial in solving computationally hard problems, e.g., subspace clustering, protein folding, or k-anonymization of health data, where human expertise can help to reduce an exponential search space through heuristic selection of samples. Therefore, what would otherwise be an NP-hard problem, reduces greatly in complexity through the input and the assistance of a human agent involved in the learning phase.",3,2,119,131,Online machine learning; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Preference learning; Robot learning; Instance-based learning; Multi-task learning; Computer science; Computational learning theory; Semi-supervised learning; Active learning (machine learning),Health informatics; Interactive machine learning,,,,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40708-016-0042-6.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27747607/ https://braininformatics.springeropen.com/articles/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://paperity.org/p/75654070/interactive-machine-learning-for-health-informatics-when-do-we-need-the-human-in-the-loop https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6/fulltext.html https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27747607 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27747607 https://core.ac.uk/display/81101303 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://braininformatics.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/braininf/braininf3.html#Holzinger16 https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/6028dcca-9ac1-351c-9064-ead1eee78294/ https://doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://graz.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/interactive-machine-learning-for-health-informatics-when-do-we-ne http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81101303.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6,27747607,10.1007/s40708-016-0042-6,2300445845,PMC4883171,3,000-452-908-115-500; 001-113-992-375-689; 001-282-557-657-435; 003-137-879-936-770; 003-973-342-108-637; 004-375-402-513-420; 004-562-487-736-159; 004-938-773-025-860; 006-700-544-765-534; 006-853-564-954-049; 008-364-160-613-630; 008-422-601-652-76X; 010-766-306-621-849; 011-168-996-451-467; 011-249-146-032-981; 011-884-609-733-497; 012-079-215-933-183; 013-309-115-263-028; 014-417-575-070-096; 014-920-389-306-737; 015-146-501-600-730; 015-621-664-628-690; 016-269-848-088-621; 017-553-582-899-906; 018-174-856-084-007; 019-706-620-416-491; 020-168-060-477-439; 021-632-025-462-293; 022-982-304-120-620; 027-341-439-641-150; 027-858-137-067-669; 027-950-451-225-380; 028-763-837-272-57X; 031-014-835-610-66X; 033-819-200-133-434; 034-851-652-190-241; 035-061-927-263-746; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-939-958-124-178; 037-180-931-726-808; 037-445-945-364-220; 037-713-870-680-680; 039-338-372-562-025; 039-724-616-573-106; 043-223-049-948-993; 043-543-499-257-287; 043-983-158-653-344; 047-082-704-948-48X; 047-913-228-306-084; 051-594-268-211-740; 052-049-996-233-000; 056-150-372-039-877; 057-132-479-900-636; 059-149-073-001-124; 060-284-038-916-879; 061-430-661-838-250; 067-016-484-735-502; 067-762-546-777-826; 072-845-292-878-073; 072-900-763-568-602; 074-606-876-553-859; 076-045-489-927-422; 076-779-845-776-935; 076-789-304-666-361; 077-263-683-592-816; 081-052-344-696-201; 081-338-565-634-024; 081-413-228-965-081; 083-654-825-952-721; 084-942-654-501-59X; 086-339-418-396-181; 087-038-433-748-875; 087-474-068-732-058; 088-540-555-817-349; 093-530-739-304-785; 101-462-049-798-032; 101-473-791-757-140; 101-851-940-081-945; 101-941-856-638-500; 105-938-017-521-49X; 106-190-180-259-726; 107-509-783-486-432; 107-681-154-093-294; 114-580-493-725-998; 117-133-276-301-317; 117-343-650-876-475; 119-906-189-979-757; 120-119-636-828-786; 122-121-736-111-462; 124-785-941-930-453; 126-372-197-661-482; 135-015-770-860-822; 136-611-809-614-934; 139-212-968-222-98X; 142-575-216-576-25X; 150-475-979-165-944; 160-201-110-469-006; 161-592-912-248-405; 165-481-111-558-538; 166-329-182-326-355; 171-372-771-640-849; 172-855-659-665-344; 174-368-575-525-04X; 177-439-903-764-707; 177-617-627-300-234; 179-116-015-392-067; 182-853-770-176-26X; 185-166-069-771-671; 186-615-101-634-413; 187-266-157-396-227; 188-006-224-106-214; 189-029-312-730-111; 189-962-596-894-510,334

In this paper, we propose an alternative stated preference elicitation technique, which we refer to as ‘trio-wise’. We explain this new technique, its relative advantages, modeling framework, and how it compares to the best-worst scaling method. To better illustrate the differences and similarities, we utilize best-worst scaling Case 2, where individuals make best and worst (most and least) choices for the attribute levels that describe a single profile. We demonstrate this new preference elicitation technique using an empirical case study that explores preferences among the general public for ways to involve them in decisions concerning the health care system. Our findings show that the best-worst scaling and trio-wise preference elicitation techniques both retrieve similar preferences. However, the capability of our trio-wise method to provide additional information on the strength of rank preferences and its ability to accommodate indifferent preferences lead us to prefer it over the standard best-worst scaling technique.",18,9,1107,1123,Empirical research; Data mining; Econometrics; Health care; Economics; Public finance; Best–worst scaling; Preference elicitation; Health services; Public involvement; Scaling,Best-worst scaling; Public health; Public involvement; Stated preference elicitation; Trio-wise,Adolescent; Adult; Choice Behavior; Decision Making; Delivery of Health Care; Empirical Research; Female; Health Services; Humans; Male; Surveys and Questionnaires,,National Institute for Health Research,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27942967 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-016-0856-4/fulltext.html http://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/24758 https://paperity.org/p/78872707/preferences-for-public-involvement-in-health-service-decisions-a-comparison-between-best https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/eujhec/v18y2017i9d10.1007_s10198-016-0856-4.html https://core.ac.uk/display/81552333 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10198-016-0856-4 https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/bitstream/1893/24758/1/Erdem_Campbell_EJHE_2017.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5641291 http://storre.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/24758 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81552333.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10198-016-0856-4,27942967,10.1007/s10198-016-0856-4,2560254791,PMC5641291,0,005-176-522-543-813; 007-114-436-495-367; 007-431-647-758-12X; 009-607-049-820-762; 013-225-323-906-421; 020-118-551-085-389; 020-825-308-673-036; 026-716-093-179-350; 030-588-751-454-723; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-153-064-626-496; 037-016-575-023-713; 038-051-521-235-227; 038-837-800-361-538; 040-551-099-736-618; 045-654-011-263-355; 055-150-853-043-993; 057-285-071-130-647; 063-794-726-354-098; 072-105-898-593-423; 076-878-501-456-878; 081-070-655-556-598; 082-536-407-395-80X; 088-891-243-329-64X; 089-566-504-872-083; 098-376-587-660-420; 102-372-296-507-391; 104-697-726-780-960; 112-822-906-532-331; 117-699-284-701-348; 122-981-844-046-434; 125-016-942-538-525; 128-315-979-589-27X; 130-760-173-706-841; 132-425-497-915-687; 134-683-171-174-465; 145-390-836-655-221; 153-363-386-761-364; 184-845-311-102-387,4

Karylowski; Karolina Szutkiewicz-Szekalska; Marzena Cypryańska,"Studies on direct comparative judgments typically show that, for items that are positively evaluated, a single item randomly drawn from a larger set of similar items tends to be judged as better than average (the BTA effect). However, Windschitl, Conybeare, and Krizan (2008) demonstrated that, under timing conditions that do not favor focusing attention on the single item, the reversal of the BTA effect occurs. We report two experiments showing that the magnitude of the reversed BTA effect increases as a function of the size of a multiitem referent with which a single item target is compared. Specifically, in direct comparative judgments of the attractiveness of positively evaluated objects (nice-looking cloth buttons, attractive buildings, or cupcakes), underestimation of the attractiveness of singletons, as compared with a multiitem set (reversed BTA effect), increased with the increased set size. Analysis of absolute judgments obtained for singletons and for small and large multiitem sets suggests that, for attractive stimuli, both the reversed BTA effect in comparative judgments and its sensitivity to set size occur as a result of a positive relationship between set size and perceived attractiveness in absolute judgments.",42,4,639,647,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Referent; Focusing attention; Positive relationship; Single item; Better than average; Attractiveness; Illusory superiority; Social psychology,,Adult; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult,,,https://paperity.org/p/35140365/reversed-better-than-average-effect-in-direct-comparisons-of-nonsocial-stimuli-depends-on https://pubpeer.com/publications/00A3CD0187CB37B37DA2E5FC2EB55A https://core.ac.uk/display/81171691 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352697 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3333111211/reversed-better-than-average-effect-in-direct-comparisons https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4024155 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81171691.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7,24352697,10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7,2098768241,PMC4024155,0,003-258-105-238-013; 012-419-306-168-454; 018-051-287-827-615; 020-681-086-245-158; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-016-667-776-519; 032-104-735-088-638; 039-044-601-310-689; 058-598-386-910-561; 064-393-430-166-126; 064-990-488-097-173; 071-386-606-831-934; 076-726-072-796-619; 078-077-264-622-029; 080-287-610-251-548; 082-662-120-833-072; 084-421-364-199-245; 091-622-417-034-204; 108-227-936-150-296; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-762-136-028-844; 172-243-671-352-087; 181-166-614-027-51X,0

However, there was no attempt to provide a systematic analysis of the different ways in which intended processes activate automatic ones. The present paper aims to fill this gap.; ; We view automatic processes as a product of interplay between information in long-term memory, reflecting life-long experience, and information in working memory, reflecting the requirement of the current situation. Such requirements are translated into task sets (Monsell et al., 2001), which activate the intended processes directly but may also activate some unintended processes indirectly. This activation of an unintended process (AUP) is a product of the overlap existing between the parameters of the intended process and those of unintended processes that are often highly practiced (Kornblum et al., 1990; Hommel, 2000).; ; Automatic processes can be triggered by AUP, and in some cases they will not start without it. Automatic processes differ in their dependence on AUP. Some automatic processes need very little AUP to occur, while for others, stronger AUP is needed (e.g., Bargh, 1989, 1992). Furthermore, AUP may not only trigger the occurrence of a process, but may also enhance its behavioral manifestation. For example, when the interference paradigm is used, the behavioral manifestation of the automatic processing, which is the interference effect, will be larger in conditions of strong vs. weak AUP.; ; We expand on the original taxonomy of dimensional overlap developed by Kornblum et al. (1990) and propose a classification of five levels of AUP, by which automatic processes are activated by intended ones. Furthermore, we demonstrate their effects using empirical findings of well-known indicators of automaticity. Note that a single task can provide AUP at multiple levels.",4,,851,851,Artificial intelligence; Cognitive science; Working memory; Automatic processing; Single task; Automaticity; Computer science,automatic and intended actions; automaticity; interference paradigm; task-dependence,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/26662346 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00851/full https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/24312067 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00851/abstract http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3826071/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82871812.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00851,24312067,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00851,2141566137,PMC3826071,0,001-244-253-407-376; 005-096-572-877-846; 006-522-471-058-468; 010-818-726-913-655; 010-895-936-888-67X; 012-059-508-246-856; 014-828-013-317-882; 018-700-486-007-166; 022-745-462-199-785; 023-540-148-927-518; 024-738-518-299-951; 030-242-387-577-541; 031-689-151-803-044; 037-054-632-717-760; 041-997-743-363-051; 042-122-651-210-247; 042-852-220-542-295; 049-638-196-987-151; 061-266-607-128-096; 062-073-416-513-966; 063-081-058-826-669; 067-033-829-394-657; 067-402-786-755-256; 076-723-476-836-046; 078-092-884-440-379; 085-137-518-299-037; 088-277-640-302-23X; 101-483-170-386-681; 104-898-249-163-45X; 107-765-503-548-727; 113-334-258-248-167; 119-379-111-158-017; 121-192-895-866-522; 122-195-468-484-095; 130-633-667-260-956; 141-059-849-734-345; 143-801-020-809-508; 148-043-544-952-446; 150-025-073-044-048; 151-632-779-122-133; 161-186-541-778-744; 169-406-785-879-077; 182-431-635-482-977,3

Escamilla; Andy Torres; Alejandro Ortiz; Paola Salazar,"Abstract A congruity effect (CE) refers to choosing the larger of two large things (smaller of two small things) faster than vice versa. The source of the CE in comparative judgments has been debated for decades without a definitive answer. Major extant models, e.g., the semantic-coding, the expectancy, and the evidence accrual models attribute the effect to matching or mismatching between the instruction (“choose larger” or “choose smaller”) and the magnitude of the stimulus. However, previous research showed that manipulations of instruction did not have an effect on the CE. In five experiments, we showed that the instruction played no role in the generation of the CE and that serial-position-based (global), but not isolation-based (local) distinctiveness could provide a coherent explanation for the origin of the CE and a number of experimental findings related to the issues of the CE.",103,,127,150,Serial position effect; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Extant taxon; Cognitive psychology; Expectancy theory; Accrual; Optimal distinctiveness theory,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0749596X1830069X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jml.2018.08.003,,10.1016/j.jml.2018.08.003,2889456503,,0,000-554-668-882-790; 001-819-542-723-636; 005-327-076-606-022; 005-702-834-185-098; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-777-842-497-170; 009-351-777-389-759; 009-893-253-159-318; 010-895-936-888-67X; 011-060-968-966-450; 013-209-296-309-874; 016-333-888-925-627; 018-564-027-236-935; 019-125-244-295-044; 019-782-429-399-042; 022-230-424-268-222; 022-956-817-434-95X; 024-795-877-490-230; 025-703-813-430-701; 025-971-418-331-624; 026-161-860-569-805; 029-423-356-713-974; 030-960-193-803-148; 031-367-127-578-535; 033-194-466-393-578; 034-751-723-948-497; 035-455-377-634-339; 035-456-469-444-748; 037-379-498-186-385; 042-485-220-125-035; 044-786-461-439-846; 045-179-545-761-535; 059-500-250-027-241; 060-462-863-591-110; 061-556-739-571-730; 066-086-448-812-547; 067-618-087-953-600; 071-300-862-151-153; 072-276-928-442-578; 073-126-510-872-864; 076-224-341-641-78X; 077-429-765-481-076; 077-843-633-735-517; 082-479-245-913-353; 084-243-161-734-480; 084-277-600-615-738; 084-837-414-058-221; 085-064-589-550-482; 085-756-973-622-409; 092-038-674-579-284; 106-802-065-782-188; 109-926-662-069-886; 111-441-229-433-583; 113-597-147-012-180; 124-257-870-583-335; 124-844-977-980-177; 128-909-793-351-309; 129-851-969-304-440; 131-863-163-235-044; 139-536-364-453-550; 176-017-510-665-867; 177-226-574-421-404; 196-022-041-043-935,1

The results demonstrate that there is a gradual increase in the ability to inhibit visual cues and to use world knowledge for interpreting size terms. 2- and 3-year-old children only used the extremes of the perceptual range as reference points. From age four onwards children, like adults, used a cut-off point in the mid-zone of a series. From age five on, children were able to integrate world knowledge and perceptual context.

089-766-182-529-384,Thinking about post-transitional demographic regimes: A reflection,2013-06-27,2013,journal article,Demographic Research,14359871,Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research,Germany,Chris Wilson,"Background: For the last 70 years the concept of the demographic transition has provided a basis for understanding and predicting population trends in the developing world. However, a majority of the developing world’s population will soon be post-transitional - what will happen then? This paper attempts to outline where answers to this question might be found. It suggests that a valuable way to organise the study of these issues is the concept of the demographic regime. Objective: The aim of the paper is to encourage discussion on the nature of post-transitional demographic regimes around the world, especially in the developing world. The style of the reflection is that of a speculative essay - a Denkstűck or ballon d’essai. Methods: In addition to a discussion of the concept of a demographic regime, the paper looks at three possible sources of information on the determinants of post-transitional regimes in the developing world: 1) the nature of the transition itself, 2) lessons drawn from pre-transitional regimes, and 3) demographic trends in Europe and other developed countries, some which have been post-transitional for several decades. Conclusions: The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research on the topic.",28,46,1373,1388,Demographic transition; Developed country; Political science; Population; Demographic economics; Development economics; Fertility; Developing country,,,,,https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol28/46/28-46.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dem:demres:v:28:y:2013:i:46 https://ideas.repec.org/a/dem/demres/v28y2013i46.html http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol28/46/ https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/5010 https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/5010/Wilson_2013_DR_Thinking.pdf;sequence=1 https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5010/1/Wilson_2013_DR_Thinking.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,http://dx.doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,,10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,2158813199,,0,000-190-109-807-44X; 002-380-390-359-940; 003-050-004-828-88X; 005-259-479-306-954; 005-368-779-787-975; 006-646-403-584-380; 007-121-286-539-314; 010-658-274-187-735; 014-199-643-603-358; 019-143-648-364-447; 029-632-482-574-793; 030-911-347-269-339; 033-179-893-156-598; 036-171-334-217-22X; 044-023-222-494-236; 049-027-850-844-321; 049-400-030-468-888; 052-882-684-156-771; 053-648-056-971-530; 053-861-602-003-696; 054-561-741-828-497; 065-144-802-334-864; 068-277-570-821-986; 072-265-962-874-530; 076-902-643-095-382; 083-105-943-964-545; 086-036-451-633-662; 102-524-930-280-252; 112-484-885-897-438; 115-509-162-289-911; 122-388-324-120-795; 127-534-718-607-496; 138-741-587-171-653; 148-393-890-656-762; 168-371-035-815-249; 172-034-065-460-87X; 180-639-417-844-351; 181-168-240-756-660; 182-194-287-848-20X; 191-276-371-939-273; 194-818-031-191-820,10

Prum,"This work proposes a coevolutionary theory of aesthetics that encompasses both biotic and human arts. Anthropocentric perspectives in aesthetics prevent the recognition of the ontological complexity of the aesthetics of nature, and the aesthetic agency of many non-human organisms. The process of evaluative coevolution is shared by all biotic advertisements. I propose that art consists of a form of communication that coevolves with its own evaluation. Art and art history are population phenomena. I expand Arthur Danto’s Artworld concept to any aesthetic population of producers and evaluators. Current concepts of art cannot exclusively circumscribe the human arts from many forms of non-human biotic art. Without assuming an arbitrarily anthropocentric perspective, any concept of art will need to engage with biodiversity, and either recognize many instances of biotic advertisements as art, or exclude some instances of human art. Coevolutionary aesthetic theory provides a heuristic account of aesthetic change in both human and biotic artworlds, including the coevolutionary origin of aesthetic properties and aesthetic value within artworlds. Restructuring aesthetics, art criticism, and art history without human beings at the organizing centers of these disciplines stimulate new progress in our understanding of art, and the unique human contributions to aesthetics and aesthetic diversity.",28,5,811,832,Aesthetics; Philosophy; Philosophy of biology; Art criticism; Ontology; Population; Coevolution; Restructuring; The arts; Anthropocentrism,Aesthetic evolution; Aesthetics of nature; Aposematism; Art; Mate choice; Ornament,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-013-9389-8 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/instance/3745613/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-013-9389-8 https://prumlab.yale.edu/sites/default/files/prum_2013.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23970809 https://core.ac.uk/display/81756646 https://paperity.org/p/11695577/coevolutionary-aesthetics-in-human-and-biotic-artworlds http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3745613 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10539-013-9389-8/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81756646.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10539-013-9389-8,23970809,10.1007/s10539-013-9389-8,2150774878,PMC3745613,0,001-137-869-000-992; 007-728-582-210-346; 008-175-183-300-853; 008-467-802-983-273; 011-348-849-012-091; 011-512-779-550-274; 013-900-543-260-091; 013-993-812-250-576; 014-719-410-283-628; 015-253-329-979-278; 015-268-834-279-506; 019-076-944-739-445; 019-155-285-243-627; 019-271-584-199-281; 019-294-409-023-395; 020-584-985-499-720; 022-436-533-877-127; 025-446-721-030-634; 029-691-152-717-528; 036-967-985-327-442; 043-424-594-826-730; 043-958-256-318-262; 046-620-538-180-91X; 047-162-657-702-523; 048-906-430-002-675; 049-839-481-911-544; 050-321-426-667-672; 054-179-831-153-414; 054-604-797-471-201; 059-656-029-468-989; 060-594-061-051-467; 062-118-247-968-412; 062-277-671-536-131; 062-480-539-579-47X; 070-196-742-788-121; 074-332-201-021-314; 080-741-797-593-499; 085-931-666-942-74X; 089-322-902-544-033; 092-033-909-364-470; 100-369-338-920-919; 103-758-616-194-004; 105-548-964-593-201; 111-461-685-776-959; 114-038-995-086-532; 114-785-331-529-280; 116-070-073-462-362; 118-474-565-714-128; 129-987-657-482-056; 145-603-692-099-33X; 146-876-993-112-315; 147-659-854-774-613; 153-010-257-230-790; 173-306-717-851-263; 183-065-405-793-138,18

Previous studies of facial symmetry detection have used front views of faces where the decision could be made on 2D image properties rather than 3D facial properties. These studies also employed comparative judgements, which could be influenced by attractiveness rather than symmetry. Two experiments explored the ability to detect typical levels of 3D facial asymmetry (contrasted with wholly symmetrical faces) from 2D projections of faces. Experiment 1 showed that asymmetry detection was impaired by inversion but even more impaired by 90 degrees rotation demonstrating the importance of the vertical reflection. Asymmetry detection was also reduced by yaw rotation of the head but still above-chance at 30 degrees rotation. Experiment 2 explored the effect of asymmetrical lighting and yaw rotation up to 45 degrees. Detection of asymmetry was affected by asymmetrical lighting and yaw rotation in a non-additive manner. The results are discussed in terms of the special role that faces and vertical symmetry play in visual perception.",9,10,243,,Artificial intelligence; Facial symmetry; Visual perception; Yaw; Perception; Image properties; Evolutionary significance; Attractiveness; Computer vision; Asymmetry; Computer science,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/557bce23014d4bf8bcff81bdf087b152 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/symmetry/symmetry9.html#Lewis17 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/105793/ https://doi.org/10.3390/sym9100243 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/243/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/120131965 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/243/htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym9100243,,10.3390/sym9100243,2766301423,,0,000-344-701-320-71X; 003-715-744-671-180; 006-334-457-608-402; 007-191-161-760-617; 009-329-227-862-539; 010-419-347-919-709; 011-180-672-203-32X; 012-989-027-745-911; 013-978-636-141-278; 015-396-217-117-604; 018-717-256-906-255; 021-795-202-147-945; 024-831-706-940-984; 025-466-559-704-669; 026-196-385-155-83X; 026-443-346-821-284; 027-727-088-316-672; 029-938-349-681-102; 032-175-635-090-35X; 032-799-454-429-903; 037-218-545-135-146; 038-229-126-373-65X; 039-803-540-678-272; 044-049-628-521-308; 045-447-773-101-81X; 046-627-664-777-815; 052-366-430-773-066; 055-087-156-656-461; 058-676-739-798-896; 058-915-209-988-786; 060-348-522-596-467; 066-140-731-426-777; 066-217-650-604-861; 067-530-864-213-011; 067-872-041-138-065; 067-977-495-673-08X; 071-166-027-221-635; 095-095-401-840-950; 097-591-314-335-329; 104-953-574-480-714; 109-065-312-226-210; 110-544-385-561-208; 131-154-104-703-838; 139-241-958-305-012; 140-289-367-706-840; 154-287-098-770-121; 181-703-420-251-418,2

In this work, we investigate how a robot can use information from prior conversations with the same child to foster a sense of relationship over time. To address this question, we conducted a repeated interaction study with three experimental conditions: a baseline control condition, in which the robot retains no information between conversations and relies on a typical elicitation-response paradigm; a persistence condition, in which children experience the same topic flow but with some robot turns that refer back to prior shared events; and a pro-active persistence condition, in which the robot attempts to offer its own feelings and opinions pro-actively and congruently with what it knows about the child. Our results indicate age differences with respect to the measures of interest. During conversations with the robot, older children who were assigned to the persistence conditions exhibited more positive affect, while younger children showed more positive affect in the control condition. Moreover, in a set of comparative judgments among robots they had played with, children in the augmented persistence condition considered PIPER to be the most intelligent and their favorite more often than children in the other conditions, overall, but the effect was more evident in the older children.",,,238,247,Feeling; Developmental psychology; Human–robot interaction; Psychology; Age differences; Affect (psychology); Robot,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/acmidc/idc2017.html#LeitePL17 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3079728 https://doi.org/10.1145/3078072.3079728 http://doi.org/10.1145/3078072.3079728,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3078072.3079728,,10.1145/3078072.3079728,2718583031,,0,000-065-611-355-79X; 000-918-989-954-999; 002-061-879-745-013; 007-511-913-033-405; 007-766-609-964-699; 015-761-954-285-133; 016-243-166-814-483; 016-679-444-097-478; 023-242-445-386-732; 029-957-643-722-503; 040-661-870-633-506; 055-833-654-760-327; 056-383-997-059-162; 058-294-664-561-179; 068-182-739-507-908; 074-189-478-667-83X; 093-474-449-634-141; 095-330-270-827-533; 102-617-716-963-549; 103-818-725-314-353; 107-110-695-255-154; 109-313-203-708-800; 118-489-810-991-068; 146-100-739-104-91X; 160-518-248-359-550; 168-862-694-886-194; 178-752-058-271-389; 191-483-561-332-335; 195-190-544-314-414,13

Using the analytic hierarchy process method to generate weightings for the various elements which contribute to destination competitiveness, the study prioritizes aspects of hot springs tourism which would benefit from further development. A panel of experts commented on the relative competitiveness of hot springs tourism in Taiwan and Japan, and concluded that hot springs proprietors need to reinforce their conservation efforts and engage in the sustainable use of hot springs and surrounding environments. They noted that governments should formulate and implement strategic destination planning and development to avoid a repetition of previous mistakes. The increasing Taiwanese preoccupation with good health and longevity and Taiwan's rich endowment of high-grade natural hot springs produces a favorable environment development of the hot springs tourism sector. It also offers business opportunities to extend the appeal of hot springs tourism into health protection and medical treatment. The article concludes that Taiwan's hot springs tourism sector has a promising future, but that concerted effort will be needed to match the product offerings of its competitors.",15,5,531,544,Competitor analysis; Environmental economics; Business; Endowment; Marketing; Tourism; Destinations; Terms of trade; Sustainability; Tourism geography; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/cog/ta/2010/00000015/00000005/art00002 https://www.growkudos.com/publications/10.3727%252F108354210x12889831783233/reader https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20113241357 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Brian_King3/publication/233656547_International_Competitiveness_in_Hot_Springs_Tourism_An_Application_of_the_Analytical_Hierarchy_Process_Approach/links/54e302890cf29666379828b3.pdf http://vuir.vu.edu.au/7006/1/s3.pdf http://vuir.vu.edu.au/7006/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3398670,http://dx.doi.org/10.3727/108354210x12889831783233,,10.3727/108354210x12889831783233,2012559682,,0,054-751-107-848-64X,9

Any support from the citizens?",,2017,journal article,"Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal",18646042,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Germany,Francesco Farina; Roberto Tamborini,"The 'Five Presidents Report' cited in the title acknowledges that an important driver of the European economic crisis has been the faulty original design of the Monetary Union, and that substantial steps are urgently needed towards the creation of truly supranational institutions. Yet, economists tend to neglect that however compelling economic analyses may be, the stumbling block on the way of the reform of the Monetary Union is political will, and that in democracies the ultimate source of political will comes from electors. In this paper, first of all the authors wish to bring to the economists' attention some recent analyses of citizens' attitudes towards Europe from political science. Then, by cross-referencing the results of the 2014 elections of the European Parliament with Eurobarometer opinion polls eliciting judgements for the EU vis-a-vis home countries and an indicator of economic pain, the authors show the presence of a geo-economic-political cleavage across four groups of countries. This is more complex, and perhaps worse, than the simplistic divide between 'North' and 'South' or 'Core' and 'Periphery'. The main implication is that the EU experiences a stalemate between 'more Europe vs. less Europe' at the level of peoples, which seriously undermines support for further integration 'from below'.",11,,1,26,Stalemate; Political economy; Economics; European integration; Economic and monetary union; Neglect; Eurobarometer; Parliament; Development economics; Politics,,,,,http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2017-10 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:ifweej:201710 https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/157632 https://ideas.repec.org/a/zbw/ifweej/201710.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/93362106.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-10,,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-10,2565305691,,0,,0

Hennessey; Han Liu; Holger Winnemöller; Mira Dontcheva; Niloy J. Mitra,"Accurately drawing 3D objects is difficult for untrained individuals, as it requires an understanding of perspective and its effects on geometry and proportions. Step-by-step tutorials break the complex task of sketching an entire object down into easy-to-follow steps that even a novice can follow. However, creating such tutorials requires expert knowledge and is time-consuming. As a result, the availability of tutorials for a given object or viewpoint is limited. How2Sketch (H2S) addresses this problem by automatically generating easy-to-follow tutorials for arbitrary 3D objects. Given a segmented 3D model and a camera viewpoint, H2S computes a sequence of steps for constructing a drawing scaffold comprised of geometric primitives, which helps the user draw the final contours in correct perspective and proportion. To make the drawing scaffold easy to construct, the algorithm solves for an ordering among the scaffolding primitives and explicitly makes small geometric modifications to the size and location of the object parts to simplify relative positioning. Technically, we formulate this scaffold construction as a single selection problem that simultaneously solves for the ordering and geometric changes of the primitives. We generate different tutorials on man-made objects using our method and evaluate how easily the tutorials can be followed with a user study.",,,8,,Computer graphics (images); Shape analysis (digital geometry); Geometric primitive; 3d model; Computer science; Scaffold,,,,Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council; European Research Council,http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160707980H/abstract https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3023371 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1607.html#HennesseyLWDM16 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1512728/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132736223.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/3023368.3023371,,10.1145/3023368.3023371,2495190891,,0,000-622-361-003-538; 017-591-432-501-963; 018-478-813-364-247; 025-019-972-403-478; 033-215-649-819-615; 033-815-104-020-861; 035-152-777-637-178; 037-503-202-662-318; 038-297-784-616-443; 042-600-001-039-330; 050-350-802-131-840; 050-999-086-177-069; 053-332-339-593-364; 057-439-291-030-559; 074-947-829-085-12X; 077-761-989-286-75X; 079-003-957-599-807; 079-226-738-315-358; 079-226-771-998-509; 082-553-974-196-73X; 084-184-929-824-890; 091-740-938-738-036; 092-295-365-464-843; 095-818-240-433-612; 096-394-352-921-151; 102-006-370-133-798; 109-011-906-451-85X; 113-221-203-390-747; 116-511-592-905-39X; 117-099-036-673-342; 130-981-598-460-911; 132-325-871-676-471; 135-507-325-549-199; 135-737-979-676-06X; 145-566-058-215-874; 149-791-336-774-534; 155-531-779-719-282; 155-967-885-486-707,7

Mühlbacher; Anika Kaczynski; Peter Zweifel; F. Reed Johnson,"Best-worst scaling (BWS), also known as maximum-difference scaling, is a multiattribute approach to measuring preferences. BWS aims at the analysis of preferences regarding a set of attributes, their levels or alternatives. It is a stated-preference method based on the assumption that respondents are capable of making judgments regarding the best and the worst (or the most and least important, respectively) out of three or more elements of a choice-set. As is true of discrete choice experiments (DCE) generally, BWS avoids the known weaknesses of rating and ranking scales while holding the promise of generating additional information by making respondents choose twice, namely the best as well as the worst criteria. A systematic literature review found 53 BWS applications in health and healthcare. This article expounds possibilities of application, the underlying theoretical concepts and the implementation of BWS in its three variants: ‘object case’, ‘profile case’, ‘multiprofile case’. This paper contains a survey of BWS methods and revolves around study design, experimental design, and data analysis. Moreover the article discusses the strengths and weaknesses of the three types of BWS distinguished and offered an outlook. A companion paper focuses on special issues of theory and statistical inference confronting BWS in preference measurement.",6,1,2,2,Statistical inference; Health care; Economics; Systematic review; Ranking; As is; Health services research; Operations research; Health economics; Strengths and weaknesses,BWS; Best-worst scaling; Experimental measurement; Healthcare decision making; Patient preferences,,,,https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:spr:hecrev:v:6:y:2015:i:1:p:1-14:10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1186%2Fs13561-015-0079-x.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26743636 https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/hecrev/v6y2016i1d10.1186_s13561-015-0079-x.html https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26743636/ https://econpapers.repec.org/article/sprhecrev/v_3a6_3ay_3a2016_3ai_3a1_3ad_3a10.1186_5fs13561-015-0079-x.htm https://paperity.org/p/75091639/experimental-measurement-of-preferences-in-health-and-healthcare-using-best-worst-scaling https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4705077 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80046918.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x,26743636,10.1186/s13561-015-0079-x,2222641375,PMC4705077,0,000-493-373-459-470; 000-649-691-797-019; 001-185-434-317-102; 001-247-001-687-889; 002-043-095-215-242; 003-829-967-213-887; 004-911-964-329-816; 005-176-522-543-813; 005-329-717-933-787; 006-605-519-594-766; 007-318-179-559-087; 009-717-844-700-388; 010-743-035-974-99X; 010-971-693-397-834; 011-507-929-205-702; 012-062-183-327-910; 012-277-806-980-851; 012-571-855-919-229; 013-987-437-862-675; 014-094-521-153-976; 014-823-332-907-713; 016-558-597-228-319; 016-884-491-310-254; 017-342-037-465-694; 017-514-000-989-679; 017-732-979-943-710; 018-904-881-990-29X; 020-523-807-232-346; 021-109-454-451-000; 023-692-915-078-354; 024-406-567-586-083; 024-587-958-541-881; 024-683-165-045-722; 025-751-577-076-283; 025-927-180-807-187; 026-050-074-629-039; 028-346-675-162-353; 029-291-884-459-584; 029-578-593-761-765; 030-541-900-761-412; 031-087-285-998-627; 034-092-502-668-647; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-109-079-236-740; 037-016-575-023-713; 037-997-181-356-073; 039-182-143-551-068; 040-551-099-736-618; 041-857-163-593-884; 042-627-416-303-850; 043-567-602-200-120; 044-662-206-591-723; 045-546-588-684-092; 048-035-524-058-636; 048-540-874-586-540; 050-943-988-713-681; 053-020-299-007-881; 053-188-785-782-815; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-213-532-262-014; 058-822-621-548-819; 063-517-091-909-073; 064-679-251-949-700; 067-738-899-236-742; 070-188-214-588-273; 071-674-642-056-169; 072-125-530-483-443; 074-043-327-134-102; 074-283-759-814-948; 074-749-086-543-603; 079-482-840-657-752; 082-771-491-914-763; 085-138-376-626-614; 085-181-923-092-361; 085-333-420-776-577; 093-149-980-450-604; 094-358-676-541-701; 098-276-409-698-049; 101-442-004-743-275; 102-372-296-507-391; 103-740-196-075-993; 103-825-964-899-614; 104-288-035-428-899; 104-522-141-185-782; 109-791-194-998-370; 120-046-843-392-845; 120-731-878-760-471; 124-783-387-855-855; 127-055-875-184-214; 128-272-310-888-967; 136-579-990-693-659; 144-759-614-838-023; 150-880-141-084-111; 158-403-210-085-10X; 158-926-736-232-728; 164-348-906-218-079; 165-551-961-584-696; 165-667-065-979-942; 179-629-903-917-048; 179-735-126-745-809,57

In this approach, the grader rank orders (rather than rate) the quality of a small set of responses. A prior automated evaluation of responses guides both set formation and scaling of rankings. Sets are formed to have similar prior scores and subsequent rankings by graders serve to update the prior scores of responses. Final response scores are determined by weighting the prior and ranking information. This approach allows for scaling comparative judgments on the basis of a single ranking, eliminates rater effects in scoring, and offers a conceptual framework for combining human and automated evaluation of constructed response tasks. To evaluate this approach, groups of graders evaluated responses to two tasks using either the ranking (with sets of 5 responses) or traditional rating approach.

091-879-828-401-973,Proficiency tests in forensic science: A step towards identifying expertise,2011-10-12,2011,,,,,,Jane Sexton,"Forensic examiners have been publicly rebuked for implausible explanations and inconsistent practice and yet, are frequently called to testify about forensic evidence in criminal cases. There is a growing sense of urgency to quantify the ability of examiners before they appear in court as expert witnesses. Perception, judgement and the ability to discriminate between complex patterns are common themes of many forensic disciplines. Building upon the fingerprint expertise research of Tangen, et al. (2011), this thesis explains how a similar framework can be developed into a proficiency paradigm and applied to all forensic evidence that requires comparative judgements. Given the increased use of photographs as court evidence and for verifying identity across society, the experiment in this study is a proficiency test of facial recognition. Recognising unfamiliar faces is challenging and people frequently make errors on matching tasks, even in optimal conditions (Megreya & Burton, 2006). Minimal scientific data exists about the range of ability in face recognition and we tested fifty-three novices (psychology students) to establish baseline performance. Twenty-seven surveillance camera operators were nominated as experts for this experiment, based on their daily exposure to faces and photographs. Group comparisons found no significant difference in overall discrimination accuracy. Additional analysis suggests the benefit of expertise may overcome the own-race effect. Within the novice group, accurate identification of own and other-race faces differed between Asian and Caucasian students. Exposure to different races seems to improve discrimination accuracy for other-race faces.",,,,,Forensic science; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Fingerprint; Perception; Judgement; Daily exposure; Proficiency test; Group comparison; Facial recognition system; Social psychology,,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:276346,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:276346,,,115159807,,0,,0

However, job applicants may intentionally distort their answers when filling in these questionnaires, undermining the validity of the test results. Forced-choice questionnaires are allegedly more resistant to intentional distortion compared to graded-scale questionnaires, but they generate ipsative data. Ipsativity violates the assumptions of classical test theory, distorting the reliability and construct validity of the scales, and producing interdependencies among the scores. This limitation is overcome in the current study by using the recently developed Thurstonian item response theory model. As online testing in job selection contexts is increasing, the focus will be on the impact of intentional distortion on personality questionnaire data collected online. The present study intends to examine the effect of three different variables on intentional distortion: (a) test format (graded-scale versus forced-choice); (b) culture, as data will be collected in three countries differing in their attitudes toward intentional distortion (the United Kingdom, Serbia, and Turkey); and (c) cognitive ability, as a possible predictor of the ability to choose the more desirable responses. Furthermore, we aim to integrate the findings using a comprehensive model of intentional distortion. In the discussion, three main aspects are considered: (a) the limitations of the manipulation, theoretical approach, and analyses employed; (b) practical implications for job selection and for personality assessment in a broader sense; and (c) suggestions for further research.",7,,933,933,Two-alternative forced choice; Classical test theory; Psychology; Personality Assessment Inventory; Personality; Item response theory; Personnel selection; Construct validity; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Ipsative,Thurstonian IRT; cross-cultural comparison; faking; forced-choice; ipsativity; personality assessment; personnel selection,,,,https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/679163 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4923072 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923072 https://philpapers.org/rec/VANSPO-9 http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/95690568 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82839473.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933,27445902,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933,2462278078,PMC4923072,0,000-489-528-822-456; 002-015-407-196-776; 003-825-878-021-084; 004-414-436-917-174; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-605-981-755-950; 012-627-916-329-389; 013-306-690-012-539; 020-618-031-109-608; 025-137-591-276-791; 027-954-386-742-59X; 031-194-283-622-830; 032-333-847-164-155; 032-348-734-542-617; 032-941-579-903-79X; 033-378-414-090-811; 033-541-341-859-841; 035-153-660-708-045; 035-586-436-180-18X; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-738-796-330-259; 050-864-145-452-633; 051-516-927-252-789; 055-878-986-170-728; 059-537-641-635-286; 060-533-748-155-140; 065-130-290-645-468; 068-887-024-059-785; 076-748-273-080-884; 079-646-550-056-48X; 079-743-335-576-735; 080-035-626-923-950; 080-749-654-385-947; 083-144-220-481-779; 089-730-755-743-093; 099-704-199-194-794; 105-306-992-739-667; 108-947-815-597-716; 111-563-008-275-644; 113-184-123-590-319; 130-958-189-347-349; 137-842-266-409-786; 160-868-949-777-94X; 168-563-911-365-679,4

F. Tan,"We consider the problem of aggregating pairwise comparisons to obtain a consensus ranking order over a collection of objects. We use the popular Bradley–Terry–Luce (BTL) model, which allows us to probabilistically describe pairwise comparisons between objects. In particular, we employ the Bayesian BTL model, which allows for meaningful prior assumptions and to cope with situations where the number of objects is large and the number of comparisons between some objects is small or even zero. For the conventional Bayesian BTL model, we derive information-theoretic lower bounds on the Bayes risk of estimators for norm-based distortion functions. We compare the information-theoretic lower bound with the Bayesian Cramer–Rao lower bound we derive for the case when the Bayes risk is the mean squared error. We illustrate the utility of the bounds through simulations by comparing them with the error performance of an expectation-maximization-based inference algorithm proposed for the Bayesian BTL model. We draw parallels between pairwise comparisons in the BTL model and interplayer games represented as edges in an Erdős–Renyi graph and analyze the effect of various graph structures on the lower bounds. We also extend the information-theoretic and Bayesian Cramer–Rao lower bounds to the more general Bayesian BTL model, which takes into account home-field advantage.",12,5,975,988,Bayesian probability; Algorithm; Machine learning; Mean squared error; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Ranking; Bayes' theorem; Inference; Mathematics; Upper and lower bounds,,,,National University of Singapore; NUS Young Investigator Award,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09676.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1709.html#abs-1709-09676 https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.09676 https://za.arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09676 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8338110 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1709.09676 https://za.arxiv.org/abs/1709.09676?context=cs http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1709.09676,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/jstsp.2018.2827303,,10.1109/jstsp.2018.2827303,2758192787,,0,013-056-378-792-578; 017-832-085-042-575; 021-526-803-476-474; 023-784-599-366-888; 024-483-744-410-492; 031-830-169-787-740; 055-767-626-277-503; 056-741-733-308-740; 062-656-735-984-807; 067-016-484-735-502; 067-860-359-894-241; 069-251-608-150-366; 070-282-043-787-112; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-185-235-230-617; 092-474-419-202-077; 093-840-610-421-917; 096-979-791-156-213; 120-424-874-837-080; 125-667-490-657-695; 129-647-393-947-516; 133-144-236-708-386; 136-510-755-969-787; 143-930-427-484-662; 156-593-002-466-490; 163-458-419-096-247; 186-588-536-371-930; 195-685-864-553-865,1

In parallel to the spatial representation of numbers along a horizontal line, temporal information is mapped on a horizontal axis with short intervals (and the past) represented to the left of long intervals (and the future). Little is known about the representation of time in the presence of visuo-spatial deficits. We here report two experiments on the comparative judgment of time. Experiment 1 required patients with left-sided neglect to indicate which of two consecutively presented silent intervals was longer. Their judgments were better if the first interval was longer and they judged the first interval longer on trials in which the two intervals were equally long. These results were not present in right-hemispheric damaged patients without neglect and healthy controls. They are in line with a previously reported finding in a single patient with neglect, but not readily compatible with findings of neglect patients' comparative length judgments. In Experiment 2, healthy participants' performance on an identical task improved for trials with a first-longer interval after caloric vestibular stimulation (CVS) of the right ear with warm water.",35,8,458,470,Spacetime; Horizontal line test; Psychology; Vestibular system; Caloric theory; Perception; Neglect; Horizontal axis; Audiology; Posterior parietal cortex,Perception; caloric vestibular stimulation; neglect; space; time,Aged; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Middle Aged; Perceptual Disorders; Space Perception/physiology; Time Perception/physiology,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30497331 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02643294.2018.1549027 https://europepmc.org/article/MED/30497331 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/161065/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02643294.2018.1549027,30497331,10.1080/02643294.2018.1549027,2903317293,,0,002-288-369-617-624; 002-440-700-489-786; 002-663-555-629-241; 006-541-936-245-698; 006-596-155-290-179; 006-601-877-752-156; 007-196-893-949-397; 008-817-891-248-429; 009-864-847-237-149; 013-050-525-016-038; 013-485-864-792-317; 016-227-375-936-145; 017-085-892-218-550; 018-066-357-545-886; 019-594-323-431-667; 020-169-741-930-563; 024-383-577-066-154; 025-337-626-963-425; 026-380-955-565-508; 027-130-490-564-453; 027-849-043-199-48X; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-077-552-631-032; 030-665-044-131-315; 031-354-602-275-988; 032-237-252-273-598; 033-527-001-452-462; 036-001-714-608-271; 037-021-312-327-498; 038-761-322-355-839; 039-284-752-797-001; 040-153-115-902-919; 042-548-909-796-598; 045-221-541-144-317; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-382-286-070-723; 048-845-769-950-336; 053-966-479-715-057; 055-141-875-717-317; 057-386-076-107-449; 058-934-115-001-489; 059-424-379-092-456; 061-736-248-054-825; 063-194-746-671-884; 063-971-283-669-30X; 065-742-954-885-569; 069-081-940-793-006; 069-681-226-142-483; 071-928-444-520-271; 074-459-704-421-852; 077-687-357-971-860; 078-684-752-983-047; 090-148-467-558-952; 094-017-185-291-853; 094-716-426-006-80X; 096-974-841-889-042; 106-544-453-242-926; 109-822-108-473-834; 116-510-452-520-67X; 118-581-038-700-756; 125-449-638-201-059; 131-040-957-155-671; 132-722-962-323-38X; 140-564-588-052-186; 141-867-468-081-649; 158-027-757-266-135; 167-121-513-943-782; 179-329-584-838-398; 183-525-561-105-629,1

The current study examines the basic number representations that allow individuals to perform higher-level arithmetical procedures. These representations are normally present in the earliest stages of development, but they may be affected by cultural, developmental, and educational factors. Deaf and hearing participants were asked to perform two number comparison tasks. Analysis of response times revealed that all participants showed effects normally associated with representation of magnitude on a visual-analog mental number line: SNARC, distance, and size effects. However, deaf participants were slower overall in making comparative judgements, suggesting that whilst their numerical representation does not differ from that of hearing individuals, the efficiency with which they process basic numerical information is lower. The results are discussed in terms of interactions between biologically determined numerical representations and cultural and schooling factors that differentially affect deaf and hearing individuals.",15,3,223,236,Erikson's stages of psychosocial development; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Number representation; Mental number line; Mathematical ability; Cultural influence,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ698077 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/snarc-hunting-examining-number-representation-in-deaf-students https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608005000142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2005.01.004,,10.1016/j.lindif.2005.01.004,2070028566,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 002-093-118-383-755; 003-626-441-665-213; 005-725-817-996-691; 007-396-120-137-676; 008-750-609-169-097; 009-848-557-018-765; 010-187-743-570-895; 011-109-503-221-760; 012-126-563-786-633; 012-386-984-787-272; 012-888-856-322-905; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-932-952-551-526; 016-227-375-936-145; 018-843-349-234-58X; 019-971-667-171-45X; 021-527-667-379-059; 024-074-817-864-157; 027-025-577-655-193; 027-052-718-619-027; 027-686-653-711-512; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-541-539-785-70X; 032-318-802-530-902; 034-459-270-159-517; 036-133-195-355-501; 036-693-275-000-730; 039-569-462-353-364; 045-946-516-220-881; 049-092-751-377-693; 051-472-129-782-759; 052-264-047-560-423; 053-914-696-508-092; 054-461-279-321-072; 058-101-541-281-341; 060-192-954-093-945; 060-551-132-182-852; 060-778-427-738-113; 064-352-210-500-873; 065-301-737-906-059; 066-857-532-351-66X; 067-280-694-341-045; 070-633-946-680-713; 080-294-391-171-462; 081-689-136-042-922; 082-567-920-386-21X; 084-421-364-199-245; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-849-249-876-733; 092-272-102-076-652; 095-635-258-346-689; 096-970-737-166-540; 108-164-445-874-825; 110-796-036-243-296; 120-204-913-104-353; 129-827-356-327-594; 138-281-982-150-380; 151-362-529-354-487; 151-895-257-464-093; 155-534-200-752-360; 166-222-949-803-699; 167-388-826-583-987; 172-456-113-290-327; 177-015-691-281-199; 184-994-768-086-419; 186-479-589-178-971,36

Audio recordings were made in urban spaces with water features such as fountains, streams, water sculptures, or waterfalls. The temporal and spectral aspects of the sounds were clarified, and subjective evaluations were performed to find the proper level difference between water sounds and road traffic noise for making urban soundscape more subjectively pleasant. The results indicated that the perceptual difference of the water sound level was around 3 dB with noises from road traffic in the background. The water sound, which had 3 dB less sound pressure level, was evaluated as preferable when the levels of road traffic noise were 55 or 75 dBA. It was also found that water sounds with relatively greater energy in low-frequency ranges were effective for masking noise caused by road traffic. The results of the present study will be valuable to urban designers and planners by providing guidelines for improving design solutions for water features in urban soundscape",58,5,477,483,Engineering; Soundscape; Masking (art); Acoustics; Perception; Traffic noise; Road traffic; Sound pressure,,,,,https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/3001000/ https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3402099 https://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ince/ncej/2010/00000058/00000005/art00002 https://hanyang.elsevierpure.com/en/publications/evaluating-water-sounds-to-improve-the-soundscape-of-urban-areas- https://core.ac.uk/display/80775919 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80775919.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3397/1.3484183,,10.3397/1.3484183,1990188462,,0,,36

Aided by advances in computational techniques, choice models can now accommodate a wide range of different data types and sources of preference variability among respondents induced by such diverse factors as person-specific choice sets or different functional forms for the underlying utility representations. At the same time, these models are increasingly challenged by behavioral work demonstrating the prevalence of choice behavior that is not consistent with the underlying assumptions of these models. I discuss new modeling avenues that can account for such seemingly inconsistent choice behavior and conclude by emphasizing the interdisciplinary frontiers in the study of choice behavior and the resulting challenges for psychometricians.",71,4,615,629,Identifiability; Data type; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Psychometrics; Utility theory; Random utility models; Mathematics,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/spr/psycho/v71y2006i4p615-629.html https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs11336-006-1598-5 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11336-006-1598-5/fulltext.html https://paperity.org/p/26624487/thurstonian-based-analyses-past-present-and-future-utilities http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2798976 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2798976/ https://www.scholars.northwestern.edu/en/publications/thurstonian-based-analyses-past-present-and-future-utilities https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ762710 https://core.ac.uk/display/23224668 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81063767.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11336-006-1598-5,20046841,10.1007/s11336-006-1598-5,2062682145,PMC2798976,0,000-213-931-311-544; 002-909-502-993-880; 005-879-470-000-235; 005-969-020-358-765; 007-484-909-003-94X; 009-218-446-922-560; 009-228-760-116-136; 009-316-589-031-043; 010-124-857-136-503; 011-230-613-424-301; 012-277-806-980-851; 012-614-486-544-886; 013-282-131-654-89X; 014-703-279-291-553; 015-017-393-446-455; 015-241-838-192-918; 015-570-098-276-821; 016-220-919-240-073; 017-166-424-652-094; 020-794-718-130-369; 021-846-286-218-057; 022-368-970-621-259; 023-109-133-665-238; 024-042-382-609-803; 024-375-879-515-197; 025-673-789-137-374; 026-506-897-501-75X; 027-812-062-895-342; 028-578-156-029-158; 029-676-947-536-901; 031-822-934-437-204; 033-125-095-839-403; 033-538-377-377-548; 033-681-151-777-495; 034-263-428-003-244; 034-683-083-765-921; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-913-111-938-891; 036-456-013-715-892; 036-765-179-971-377; 037-000-251-699-294; 037-420-636-256-794; 038-143-242-118-579; 039-041-395-053-293; 039-896-259-350-588; 041-141-612-502-359; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-339-910-496-09X; 042-627-416-303-850; 043-271-342-349-398; 043-926-861-544-878; 044-123-400-873-916; 045-090-499-723-595; 045-457-272-610-893; 047-371-453-218-511; 048-089-681-958-578; 050-209-265-352-054; 052-249-155-437-451; 053-503-090-320-486; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-165-675-762-127; 062-783-280-287-096; 063-320-964-120-516; 064-195-089-887-677; 065-358-247-165-582; 069-673-690-058-437; 070-022-364-335-159; 071-110-982-489-792; 071-539-411-402-130; 071-674-642-056-169; 073-735-045-819-761; 074-529-604-461-92X; 079-276-973-259-03X; 080-512-565-762-776; 081-587-309-140-639; 082-439-348-646-693; 083-856-603-542-79X; 085-633-341-827-780; 087-528-231-757-329; 087-951-282-657-203; 089-251-383-360-199; 089-468-883-189-639; 089-581-544-778-193; 090-031-408-689-419; 093-149-980-450-604; 094-871-966-399-798; 095-470-368-599-465; 098-376-587-660-420; 100-941-390-287-772; 102-300-470-951-381; 111-575-691-927-253; 113-278-954-446-219; 113-679-398-334-933; 117-652-347-990-565; 121-378-214-742-205; 123-677-559-824-436; 124-783-387-855-855; 125-348-819-879-94X; 125-991-149-017-306; 127-531-497-026-749; 130-089-446-682-200; 133-164-616-930-569; 155-351-447-483-439; 155-377-889-709-955; 163-470-455-761-314; 164-260-106-908-120; 164-890-993-563-355; 181-809-755-765-694; 185-583-432-618-274; 188-522-689-468-400; 194-093-025-282-00X; 198-754-631-432-902,43

093-918-958-199-98X,Consumer reactions to price-quantity tactics,,2015,dissertation,,,,,Jun Yao,"Marketers employ a variety of pricing tactics such as pennies-a-day, price matching, price partitioning, everyday low pricing and comparative price claims. This thesis adopts the term “tactics” to delineate the marketing strategies that utilize price and quantity (which here specifically refers to the volume or size of a single product) to influence consumer behaviours. There is an emerging research stream examining how consumers respond to various price-quantity tactics. This thesis contributes to this literature by investigating consumer reactions to two different price-quantity tactics. The thesis consists of two independent essays.; Essay one identifies and distinguishes between situations where product alternatives are framed with equal quantities and unequal prices where consumers actually compare product prices, and situations where alternatives are framed with equal prices and unequal quantities where consumers actually compare product quantities in order to make judgments and decisions. It examines how consumer comparative judgments and purchase decisions differ in these two situations, and examines the process underlying this effect. ; Drawing on multi-attribute loss aversion, essay one proposes a greater aversion to quantity loss than price loss among consumers. Results of a series of experimental studies show that the difference between competing brands having unequal sizes and equal prices (e.g., product A: $3.51/300ml versus product B: $3.51/330ml) is generally perceived as larger than the difference between competing brands having unequal prices and equal sizes (e.g., product A: $3.51/300ml versus product B: $3.19/300ml). However, this effect is reversed when equal-value attributes are removed from the comparison (i.e., removal of $3.51 for the former case and removal of 300ml for the latter case) and it is therefore context-dependent. Further, it demonstrates the moderating roles of numerical representation type (Pandelaere, Briers, & Lembregts, 2011) of the price/size differences on the comparative judgments. Finally, it shows that when product alternatives have unequal sizes and equal prices, this leads to a greater perceived difference in product values than when they have unequal prices and equal sizes. As a result, consumers favour the option which is framed as a bigger package, relative to the same option which is framed as a lower price, in product selection.; Essay two identifies unit pricing (i.e., displaying unit costs on price tags) as an important price-quantity tactic associated with varying prices and sizes. It proposes a psychological model of how unit pricing affects consumer purchase decisions and tests it in the context of identical product quantities, explaining why the presence of unit price information makes consumers more inclined to choose products with lower unit prices in general. Prior research shows that the presence of unit price information in a grocery shopping context leads consumers to choose lower unit priced products. However, the process underlying this effect remains unclear. Essay two suggests that the unit pricing effect is both cognitively and motivationally driven as it makes it not only easier to find the cheaper options, but also creates a greater non-conscious desire to choose these options. The results from four experiments show that the motivational effect occurs even when products are identically sized. Results also indicate that the motivational effect of unit pricing operates independently of the cognitive effect and therefore is automatic. It finally shows that the motivational effect generalizes to the evaluation of price discounts and discovers a boundary condition where unit pricing actually decreases rather than increases price salience.",,,,,Limit price; Psychological pricing; Economics; Marketing; Microeconomics; Salience (language); Consumer behaviour; Loss aversion; Grocery shopping; Price matching; Unit price,,,,,https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Consumer_reactions_to_price-quantity_tactics/4670449/1,https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/thesis/Consumer_reactions_to_price-quantity_tactics/4670449/1,,,2206595758,,0,,0

We are primarily interested in cardinal data based on scores or ratings though our methods also give specific insights on ordinal data. From raw ranking data, we construct pairwise rankings, represented as edge flows on an appropriate graph. Our statistical ranking method exploits the graph Helmholtzian, which is the graph theoretic analogue of the Helmholtz operator or vector Laplacian, in much the same way the graph Laplacian is an analogue of the Laplace operator or scalar Laplacian. We shall study the graph Helmholtzian using combinatorial Hodge theory, which provides a way to unravel ranking information from edge flows. In particular, we show that every edge flow representing pairwise ranking can be resolved into two orthogonal components, a gradient flow that represents the l 2-optimal global ranking and a divergence-free flow (cyclic) that measures the validity of the global ranking obtained—if this is large, then it indicates that the data does not have a good global ranking. This divergence-free flow can be further decomposed orthogonally into a curl flow (locally cyclic) and a harmonic flow (locally acyclic but globally cyclic); these provides information on whether inconsistency in the ranking data arises locally or globally. When applied to statistical ranking problems, Hodge decomposition sheds light on whether a given dataset may be globally ranked in a meaningful way or if the data is inherently inconsistent and thus could not have any reasonable global ranking; in the latter case it provides information on the nature of the inconsistencies. An obvious advantage over the NP-hardness of Kemeny optimization is that HodgeRank may be easily computed via a linear least squares regression. We also discuss connections with well-known ordinal ranking techniques such as Kemeny optimization and Borda count from social choice theory.",127,1,203,244,Ordinal analysis; Laplacian matrix; Ranking SVM; Mathematical optimization; Ranking (information retrieval); Ranking; Mathematics; Vector Laplacian; Theoretical computer science; Ordinal data; Graph theory,,,,,https://geometry.stanford.edu/papers/jlyy-lrcht-09/jlyy-lrcht-09.pdf https://galton.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/meetings/mathofranking/ref/jiang-lim-yao-ye.pdf https://doi.org/10.1007/s10107-010-0419-x https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-010-0419-x http://web.stanford.edu/~yyye/hodgeRank2011.pdf https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10107-010-0419-x.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81516055 https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-80467 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/mp/mp127.html#JiangLYY11 http://www.math.pku.edu.cn/teachers/yaoy/publications/HodgeRank.MathProg.B.2010.pdf https://www.stat.uchicago.edu/~lekheng/meetings/mathofranking/ref/jiang-lim-yao-ye.pdf https://paperity.org/p/18252114/statistical-ranking-and-combinatorial-hodge-theory https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81516055.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10107-010-0419-x,,10.1007/s10107-010-0419-x,2130406232,,2,000-626-786-009-263; 002-033-126-481-705; 004-828-689-230-442; 005-837-765-200-191; 009-881-393-198-900; 010-116-756-881-344; 010-136-645-510-231; 011-105-391-999-886; 018-269-445-638-29X; 030-362-434-376-248; 034-246-528-290-581; 035-247-601-750-582; 035-731-797-589-077; 041-203-653-471-633; 042-043-208-953-614; 044-268-654-736-388; 049-804-548-026-532; 052-468-724-042-629; 052-568-898-489-058; 054-786-735-916-965; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-586-016-478-58X; 058-095-741-339-677; 060-275-798-238-543; 062-809-108-147-246; 065-444-469-001-55X; 065-622-071-262-329; 067-947-103-837-173; 068-885-458-943-499; 068-949-556-372-271; 069-087-348-801-174; 073-206-313-920-37X; 075-208-362-608-800; 077-816-067-577-003; 082-298-749-877-760; 083-231-400-366-060; 084-628-549-959-384; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-763-890-364-502; 089-128-002-054-734; 091-299-050-457-00X; 091-666-780-893-50X; 093-539-423-650-420; 095-343-050-791-375; 097-109-759-977-748; 098-082-636-476-889; 098-895-722-161-291; 105-628-862-061-546; 107-517-318-823-851; 109-668-006-494-690; 113-278-954-446-219; 129-349-900-733-673; 129-681-729-979-79X; 133-280-151-358-58X; 140-472-174-571-797; 158-510-731-113-501; 160-599-520-655-787; 163-262-993-672-849; 168-179-710-216-312; 174-619-377-275-100; 180-132-253-328-605,214

Zhang,"Given partially observed pairwise comparison data generated by the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, we study the problem of top-$k$ ranking. That is, to optimally identify the set of top-$k$ players. We derive the minimax rate with respect to a normalized Hamming loss. This provides the first result in the literature that characterizes the partial recovery error in terms of the proportion of mistakes for top-$k$ ranking. We also derive the optimal signal to noise ratio condition for the exact recovery of the top-$k$ set. The maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) is shown to achieve both optimal partial recovery and optimal exact recovery. On the other hand, we show another popular algorithm, the spectral method, is in general sub-optimal. Our results complement the recent work by Chen et al. (2019) that shows both the MLE and the spectral method achieve the optimal sample complexity for exact recovery. It turns out the leading constants of the sample complexity are different for the two algorithms. Another contribution that may be of independent interest is the analysis of the MLE without any penalty or regularization for the BTL model. This closes an important gap between theory and practice in the literature of ranking.",,,,,Algorithm; Normalization (statistics); Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Spectral method; Mathematics; Hamming code; Signal-to-noise ratio; Regularization (mathematics),,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16485 https://it.arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16485 https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.16485 https://au.arxiv.org/abs/2006.16485 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16485.pdf http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2006.16485 https://jp.arxiv.org/abs/2006.16485 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv200616485C/abstract,http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2006.16485,,,3039543877,,0,009-214-404-200-676; 013-475-177-587-208; 015-164-124-848-632; 017-553-368-995-630; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-501-390-008-829; 027-048-508-707-668; 027-896-243-015-499; 030-289-090-008-522; 036-680-512-260-067; 042-660-311-704-61X; 047-307-839-107-965; 052-731-553-260-693; 053-790-240-372-746; 057-708-727-147-25X; 082-850-236-872-725; 091-497-730-839-690; 092-474-419-202-077; 109-668-006-494-690; 118-117-780-466-627; 123-162-762-225-639; 139-649-897-193-545; 158-687-817-281-331; 195-685-864-553-865,4

One reason is that conceptual understanding is better assessed using open-ended test questions that invite an unpredictable variety of responses that are difficult to mark. Recently a technique, called comparative judgement, has been developed that enables the reliable and valid scoring of open-ended tests. We applied this technique to the peer assessment of calculus on a first-year mathematics module. We explored the reliability and criterion validity of the outcomes using psychometric methods and a survey of participants. We report evidence that the assessment activity was reliable and valid, and discuss the strengths and limitations, as well as the practical implications, of our findings.",22,4,,,Procedural knowledge; Criterion validity; Judgement; Practical implications; Peer assessment; Management science,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Peer_assessment_of_mathematical_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9378092/files/16989464.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Peer_assessment_of_mathematical_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9378092 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/28439 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/51858/ https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/898007,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Peer_assessment_of_mathematical_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9378092,,,2785330451,,0,,1

Studies on attention and appearance have assessed subjective appearance using a task contingent upon a comparative judgment (e.g., M. Carrasco, S. Ling, & S. Read, 2004). Recently, K. A. Schneider and M. Komlos (2008) questioned the validity of those results because they did not find a significant effect of attention on contrast appearance using an equality task. They claim that such equality judgments are bias-free whereas comparative judgments are bias-prone and propose an alternative interpretation of the previous findings based on a decision bias. However, to date there is no empirical support for the superiority of the equality procedure. Here, we compare biases and sensitivity to shifts in perceived contrast of both paradigms. We measured contrast appearance using both a comparative and an equality judgment. Observers judged the contrasts of two simultaneously presented stimuli, while either the contrast of one stimulus was physically incremented (Experiments 1 and 2) or exogenous attention was drawn to it (Experiments 3 and 4). We demonstrate several methodological limitations of the equality paradigm. Nevertheless, both paradigms capture shifts in PSE due to physical and perceived changes in contrast and show that attention enhances apparent contrast.",10,11,6,6,Empirical research; Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Psychology; Perception; Covert; Decision bias; Contrast perception; Contrast (statistics); Social psychology,,Adult; Attention/physiology; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Cues; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychophysics,,NEI NIH HHS (F32 EY021420) United States; NEI NIH HHS (EY016200) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016200-01A2) United States; NEI NIH HHS (T32 EY007136) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016200) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3156576 https://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/people/Anton-Erxleben_2010_JOV.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3156576 http://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/people/Anton-Erxleben_2010_JOV.pdf https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/evaluating-comparative-and-equality-judgments-in-contrast-percept https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2191867 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/20884501/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/10.11.6,20884501,10.1167/10.11.6,1997861291,PMC3156576,0,003-198-583-089-698; 003-234-688-368-621; 003-807-659-093-556; 004-273-381-418-960; 004-756-645-401-529; 005-191-405-443-843; 006-635-585-195-621; 006-813-548-190-935; 006-890-882-656-98X; 007-139-167-596-231; 008-857-219-070-913; 010-365-101-187-201; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-941-661-113-334; 011-601-854-227-368; 012-767-072-694-523; 013-365-280-541-681; 013-910-741-713-791; 013-914-710-848-288; 014-893-281-836-583; 016-619-705-994-528; 016-806-466-483-15X; 017-440-219-046-764; 018-475-871-856-107; 018-902-176-159-944; 019-283-286-849-766; 019-907-085-939-215; 020-870-313-913-754; 021-706-576-030-98X; 022-035-864-030-513; 023-002-318-300-278; 024-215-699-434-354; 027-161-821-721-831; 028-494-560-804-402; 029-848-346-327-774; 031-324-485-402-628; 032-272-286-337-565; 032-661-232-763-509; 037-867-601-359-022; 038-617-893-245-16X; 038-622-562-533-200; 038-684-900-397-664; 039-967-993-709-570; 040-055-439-900-718; 040-142-001-640-064; 040-275-962-046-75X; 041-100-240-098-090; 042-333-379-366-890; 044-433-991-525-780; 046-359-410-953-104; 047-123-318-345-961; 050-948-703-592-234; 051-153-997-966-867; 051-367-065-938-325; 052-327-692-474-099; 054-581-153-094-317; 055-072-483-497-320; 056-058-144-104-41X; 056-141-522-259-193; 056-928-581-862-768; 057-932-152-085-09X; 061-493-249-815-530; 062-989-744-211-422; 068-538-601-844-877; 070-777-667-084-452; 071-180-357-113-371; 072-716-995-023-45X; 075-007-558-048-939; 076-233-799-838-140; 079-260-008-550-208; 079-462-073-125-262; 079-881-549-962-928; 082-476-518-518-807; 082-941-024-231-786; 085-695-431-726-24X; 087-581-286-484-877; 089-691-193-927-771; 095-633-005-262-066; 095-761-873-843-537; 097-250-909-662-702; 100-822-663-189-165; 101-718-592-082-454; 108-632-750-548-318; 112-951-565-313-763; 113-366-679-301-057; 113-805-373-613-64X; 114-902-585-779-941; 115-721-182-645-213; 116-035-406-094-913; 121-593-252-566-54X; 121-678-726-409-072; 121-779-641-653-538; 154-013-649-407-196; 159-716-474-813-389; 163-307-707-970-578; 167-928-402-405-946; 171-293-257-714-862; 195-656-865-139-575; 199-055-961-488-187,59

095-226-110-630-993,The Android English Teacher: Writing Education in the Age of Automation,2020-07-23,2020,dissertation,,,,,Daniel C Ernst,"In an era of widespread automation—from grocery store self-checkout machines to self-driving cars—it is not outrageous to wonder: can teachers be automated? And more specifically, can automated computer teachers instruct students how to write? Automated computer programs have long been used in summative writing evaluation efforts, such as scoring standardized essay exams, ranking placement essays, or facilitating programmatic outcomes assessments. However, new claims about automated writing evaluation’s (AWE) formative educational potential mark a significant shift. My project questions the effectiveness of using AWE technology for formative educational efforts such as improving and teaching writing. Taken seriously, these efforts portend a future embrace of semi, or even fully, automated writing classes, an unprecedented development in writing pedagogy.Supported by a summer-long grant from the Purdue Research Foundation, I conducted a small-n quasi-experiment to test claims by online college tutoring site Chegg.com that its EasyBib Plus AWE tool can improve both writing and writers. The experiment involved four college English instructors reading pairs of essays comprising one AWE-treated and untreated version per pair. Using a comparative judgment model, a rubric-free method of writing assessment based on Thurstone’s law, raters read and designated one of each pair “better.” Across four raters and 160 essays, I found that AWE-treated essays were designated better only 30% of the time (95% confidence interval: 20-40%), a statistically significant difference from the null hypothesis of 50%. The results suggest that Chegg’s EasyBib Plus tool offers no discernible improvement to student writing, and potentially even worsens it.Finally, I analyze Chegg’s recent partnership with the Purdue Writing Lab and Online Writing Lab (OWL). The Purdue-Chegg partnership offers a useful test case for anticipating the effects of higher education’s embrace of automated educational technology going forward. Drawing on the history of writing assessment and the results of the experiment, I argue against using AWE for formative writing instruction. In an era of growing automation, I maintain that a human-centered pedagogy remains one of the most durable, important, effective, and transformative ingredients of a quality education.",,,,,Higher education; Mathematics education; Summative assessment; Psychology; Educational technology; Educational assessment; Writing assessment; College English; Wonder; Formative assessment,,,,,https://hammer.figshare.com/articles/thesis/The_Android_English_Teacher_Writing_Education_in_the_Age_of_Automation/12698474,https://hammer.figshare.com/articles/thesis/The_Android_English_Teacher_Writing_Education_in_the_Age_of_Automation/12698474,,,3045370491,,0,,0
095-558-790-537-557,Quantity without numbers and numbers without quantity in the parietal cortex.,2009-02-21,2009,journal article,NeuroImage,10959572; 10538119,Academic Press Inc.,United States,Marinella Cappelletti; Neil G. Muggleton; Vincent Walsh,"A dominant view in numerical cognition is that processing the quantity indicated by numbers (e.g. deciding the larger between two numbers such as ‘12.07’ or ‘15.02’) relies on the intraparietal regions (IPS) of the cerebral cortex. However, it remains unclear whether the IPS could play a more general role in numerical cognition, for example in (1) quantity processing even with non-numerical stimuli (e.g. choosing the larger of ‘bikini’ and ‘coat’); and/or (2) conceptual tasks involving numbers beyond those requiring quantity processing (e.g. attributing a summer date to either ‘12.07’ or ‘15.02’).; ; In this study we applied fMRI-guided TMS to the left and right IPS, while independently manipulating stimulus and task. Our results showed that IPS involvement in numerical cognition is neither stimulus-specific nor specific for conceptual tasks. Thus, quantity judgments with numerical and non-numerical stimuli were equally affected by IPS-TMS, as well as a number conceptual task not requiring quantity comparisons. However, IPS-TMS showed no impairment for perceptual decisions on numbers without any conceptual processing (i.e. colour judgment), nor for conceptual decisions that did not involve quantity or number stimuli (e.g. summer object: ‘bikini’ or ‘coat’?). These results are consistent with proposals that the parietal areas are engaged in the conceptual representation of numbers but they challenge the most common view that number processing is so automatic that the simple presentation of numbers activates the IPS and a sense of magnitude. Rather, our results show that the IPS is only necessary when conceptual operations need to be explicitly oriented to numerical concepts.",46,2,522,529,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Visual search; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Parietal lobe; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Numerical cognition; Posterior parietal cortex; Mental representation,,Decision Making/physiology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging/methods; Male; Mathematics; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Problem Solving/physiology; Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation/methods; Young Adult,,Wellcome Trust (073537) United Kingdom; Medical Research Council (G0700929) United Kingdom,https://core.ac.uk/display/82082903 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811909001591 http://icn.ncu.edu.tw/upload/paper/20130207032932Neil_2009_Quantity%20without%20numbers%20and%20numbers%20without%20quantity%20in%20the%20parietal%20lobe..pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC2683244 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19236924 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage46.html#CappellettiMW09 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82082903.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.016,19236924,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2009.02.016,2113809733,PMC2683244,0,000-495-638-642-502; 000-606-084-961-331; 003-733-299-274-994; 004-521-565-149-566; 005-201-806-256-367; 008-660-756-899-541; 010-343-275-239-609; 014-304-423-897-683; 014-528-646-212-015; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-715-023-202-849; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-998-114-390-805; 019-567-702-794-034; 022-753-627-014-129; 026-044-626-803-55X; 027-722-881-226-813; 028-667-261-981-663; 030-969-167-161-744; 031-842-221-342-270; 033-437-431-537-213; 033-987-957-285-504; 035-217-378-418-976; 035-402-974-768-248; 035-552-279-767-677; 039-569-462-353-364; 040-352-704-543-223; 041-442-979-711-770; 041-443-014-739-771; 041-462-663-488-494; 042-029-679-044-205; 042-073-975-298-507; 051-456-721-176-715; 052-329-135-897-565; 052-556-423-157-22X; 055-797-516-443-184; 057-039-704-422-559; 057-877-558-474-926; 060-748-407-187-900; 060-779-949-886-150; 061-503-605-759-480; 062-019-355-742-61X; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-583-756-505-85X; 071-179-175-433-907; 071-921-348-948-401; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-315-728-261-014; 073-883-164-946-514; 074-868-308-452-419; 080-390-507-419-045; 084-291-089-812-62X; 094-017-185-291-853; 096-922-372-028-180; 097-404-538-289-898; 098-893-391-068-922; 100-329-685-384-712; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-650-685-401-668; 110-735-271-638-053; 113-985-328-659-252; 115-821-539-791-01X; 116-953-283-915-381; 120-378-004-521-686; 123-238-467-675-125; 129-318-604-417-885; 130-711-043-551-297; 140-940-121-070-504; 146-743-577-348-928; 149-775-701-404-962; 152-671-577-558-252; 164-509-447-310-005; 183-525-561-105-629; 186-479-589-178-971; 197-871-165-836-067,30

The experiment had two direct aims: to verify whether the relative contribution of size to apparent heaviness can differ for different stimulus sets, and to verify whether that contribution can differ for different methods of comparing two objects (consecutive vs. simultaneous weighing). Thirty university students participated. Results show that the relative contribution of size depends on stimulus set, but is independent of the method used for comparing objects. The first finding implies that a linear model cannot describe the integration of size and weight information in the illusion; the second finding is evidence for the low-level character of the integration process.",149,,52,59,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Linear model; Cognitive psychology; Illusion; Order effect; Social psychology,Constant-stimuli method; Integration model; Multisensory process; Order effect; Size–weight illusion,"Adult; Female; Humans; Illusions/physiology; Judgment/physiology; Male; Models, Theoretical; Size Perception/physiology; Weight Perception/physiology; Young Adult",,,https://core.ac.uk/display/53451758 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691814000663 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24686240,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.03.001,24686240,10.1016/j.actpsy.2014.03.001,2035834090,,0,000-277-980-868-755; 001-000-270-245-179; 001-193-868-265-047; 009-421-508-253-571; 014-306-499-557-836; 016-233-843-135-05X; 022-345-067-965-694; 022-976-413-725-353; 026-161-661-814-724; 035-035-125-393-355; 035-104-534-079-312; 035-726-974-348-631; 036-107-223-655-976; 037-054-257-598-842; 037-768-890-064-947; 049-924-503-484-093; 052-078-857-746-757; 062-065-425-913-232; 062-312-918-995-657; 072-197-353-311-466; 078-891-744-994-83X; 080-720-450-661-680; 087-134-679-581-817; 090-943-282-738-503; 092-383-269-351-785; 095-440-615-961-509; 107-200-229-262-25X; 107-503-474-931-89X; 123-198-440-603-670; 127-322-335-612-074; 127-930-296-287-932; 135-357-773-691-016; 136-792-624-826-16X; 138-143-741-264-242; 143-305-667-280-593; 159-194-489-256-073,7

Wise,"Summary Functional neuroimaging studies show that perceptual judgments about time and space activate similar prefrontal and parietal areas, and it is known that perceptions in these two cognitive domains interfere with each other. These findings have led to the theory that temporal and spatial perceptions, among other metrics, draw on a common representation of magnitude. Our results indicate that an alternative principle applies to the prefrontal cortex. Analysis at the single-cell level shows that separate, domain-specific populations of neurons encode relative magnitude in time and space. These neurons are intermixed with each other in the prefrontal cortex, along with a separate intermixed population that encodes the goal chosen on the basis of these perceptual decisions. As a result, domain-specific neural processing at the single-cell level seems to underlie domain generality as observed at the regional level, with a common representation of prospective goals rather than a common representation of magnitude.",74,4,656,662,Encoding (memory); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Perception; Generality; Prefrontal cortex; Population; Functional neuroimaging; ENCODE,,Animals; Functional Neuroimaging; Goals; Macaca mulatta; Male; Neurons/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Space Perception/physiology,,Intramural NIH HHS (Z01 MH001092) United States; Intramural NIH HHS (Z01 MH001092-29) United States,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3400847/ https://core.ac.uk/display/54429492 https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00224-3 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312002243#! https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0896627312002243 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3400847 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82232902.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.023,22632724,10.1016/j.neuron.2012.02.023,1968479074,PMC3400847,0,000-788-992-136-767; 001-203-736-061-997; 002-935-008-188-850; 007-996-363-197-55X; 008-817-891-248-429; 009-322-702-642-788; 011-637-143-375-49X; 011-701-840-369-443; 013-518-356-570-839; 015-804-916-995-414; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-661-112-251-592; 017-531-593-130-097; 022-652-372-323-428; 030-150-228-118-534; 031-316-795-276-233; 031-837-153-787-342; 033-527-001-452-462; 033-987-957-285-504; 039-425-042-014-048; 039-834-928-076-827; 041-323-502-321-36X; 049-365-634-170-299; 051-936-653-459-029; 061-536-706-188-606; 061-736-248-054-825; 062-537-064-413-234; 072-157-343-216-127; 083-238-000-384-878; 085-034-825-943-10X; 088-224-814-828-823; 091-814-028-345-11X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 116-953-283-915-381; 195-772-152-326-950,47

Human perception and performance,19391277; 00961523,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Samuel Shaki; William M. Petrusic; Craig Leth-Steensen,"With English-language readers in an experiment requiring pairwise comparative judgments of the sizes of animals, the nature of the association between the magnitudes of the animal pairs and the left or right sides of response (i.e., the SNARC effect) was reversed depending on whether the participants had to choose either the smaller or the larger member of the pair. In contrast, such a dependence of the direction of the SNARC effect on the form of the comparative instructions was not evident for pairwise comparisons of numerical magnitude made by a similar group of participants. Furthermore, exactly the same configuration of findings was obtained for a single group of Israeli-Palestinian right-to-left reading and writing participants, except that the spatial direction of the SNARC effects for both the animal-size and number comparisons were completely reversed. In a final experiment with English readers, SNARC effects paralleling those for the animal-size comparisons were obtained for pairwise comparative judgments involving the just-learned height relations between 6 imaginary individuals. As will be discussed, such results serve to extend the generality of the SNARC effect far beyond the current modal view that it simply reflects culturally influenced, long-term learned associations between numerical magnitudes and the locations on a fixed mental number line. The implications that these results have for both the Proctor and Cho (2006) polarity correspondence view and the Gevers, Verguts, Reynvoet, Caessens, and Fias (2006) computational model of the SNARC effect will also discussed.",38,2,515,530,Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Pairwise comparison; Spatial ability; Generality; Mental number line; Spatial direction; Single group; Mathematics; Linguistics; Correlation and dependence,,"Adult; Cross-Cultural Comparison; Discrimination, Psychological; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Judgment; Language; Male; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Reaction Time; Reading; Semantics; Size Perception; Symbolism; Writing; Young Adult",,Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada,http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0026729 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22288694 https://ir.library.carleton.ca/pub/25450 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ991067,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0026729,22288694,10.1037/a0026729,2037522270,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 003-375-024-877-035; 014-304-423-897-683; 015-715-023-202-849; 015-932-952-551-526; 016-576-453-371-676; 020-727-609-701-978; 020-796-776-602-976; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-005-373-749-534; 031-815-634-356-386; 032-740-059-296-825; 034-440-021-374-187; 035-013-638-860-011; 036-902-805-781-254; 039-569-462-353-364; 039-722-117-248-289; 044-786-461-439-846; 045-965-362-317-923; 052-170-651-034-465; 054-649-302-531-591; 060-551-132-182-852; 071-057-839-637-721; 073-989-930-529-45X; 078-649-785-249-179; 082-479-245-913-353; 084-421-364-199-245; 086-214-041-467-250; 092-715-514-577-680; 094-509-611-090-706; 094-569-624-756-639; 096-974-841-889-042; 102-989-146-290-553; 103-656-435-702-797; 113-095-154-061-52X; 116-462-291-514-91X; 124-257-870-583-335; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 139-708-795-933-36X; 142-391-841-278-93X; 142-997-916-133-687; 144-747-377-111-26X; 148-214-528-359-814; 154-926-021-353-934; 168-043-103-603-780; 169-747-633-428-758,39

Irwin; Robin Clark; Murray Grossman,"We often estimate an unknown value based on available relevant information, a process known as cognitive estimation. In this study, we assess the cognitive and neuroanatomic basis for quantitative estimation by examining deficits in patients with focal neurodegenerative disease in frontal and parietal cortex. Executive function and number knowledge are key components in cognitive estimation. Prefrontal cortex has been implicated in multilevel reasoning and planning processes, and parietal cortex has been associated with number knowledge required for such estimations. We administered the Biber cognitive estimation test (BCET) to assess cognitive estimation in 22 patients with prefrontal disease due to behavioral variant frontotemporal dementia (bvFTD), to 17 patients with parietal disease due to corticobasal syndrome (CBS) or posterior cortical atrophy (PCA) and 11 patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Both bvFTD and CBS/PCA patients had significantly more difficulty with cognitive estimation than controls. MCI were not impaired on BCET relative to controls. Regression analyses related BCET performance to gray matter atrophy in right lateral prefrontal and orbital frontal cortices in bvFTD, and to atrophy in right inferior parietal cortex, right insula, and fusiform cortices in CBS/PCA. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that a frontal-parietal network plays a crucial role in cognitive estimation.",9,,317,317,Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognition; Posterior cortical atrophy; Frontotemporal dementia; Disease; Atrophy; Prefrontal cortex; Cognitive impairment; Posterior parietal cortex,behavioral variant frontotemporal degeneration; cognitive estimation; corticobasal syndrome; parietal cortices; posterior cortical atrophy; prefrontal cortices,,,NINDS NIH HHS (R01 NS044266) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P01 AG032953) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG010124) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P01 AG017586) United States; NINDS NIH HHS (P50 NS053488) United States; NIA NIH HHS (K01 AG043503) United States,https://philpapers.org/rec/BISEFA-3 https://core.ac.uk/display/43880857 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26089786/ https://doaj.org/article/14b1c91d52e94842826b5ccb67cc2ac8 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4454843 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00317/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26089786 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00317/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82844226.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2015.00317,26089786,10.3389/fnhum.2015.00317,1491803593,PMC4454843,0,000-391-273-375-862; 001-188-260-228-380; 001-452-088-001-757; 002-368-544-513-583; 002-432-757-824-901; 003-841-098-795-679; 005-547-393-740-596; 006-009-026-573-042; 006-034-350-246-101; 011-102-594-867-003; 011-553-156-331-447; 011-771-935-721-992; 012-203-226-399-858; 012-674-515-358-260; 014-175-100-464-076; 016-410-979-627-568; 017-754-232-246-455; 019-316-755-001-396; 019-793-104-790-493; 020-103-873-061-214; 022-988-712-445-94X; 023-105-425-928-177; 024-915-754-540-385; 026-744-790-713-553; 027-398-062-947-308; 027-937-066-200-965; 028-148-960-466-789; 029-052-879-265-621; 030-812-688-492-949; 032-397-590-601-980; 034-393-502-726-631; 039-096-181-701-759; 039-137-191-245-863; 040-548-180-408-18X; 042-343-460-514-36X; 045-223-433-687-495; 047-247-889-419-519; 048-148-416-237-945; 048-346-642-507-912; 054-756-385-777-768; 058-384-209-575-017; 058-856-437-787-25X; 059-382-291-754-483; 059-424-567-037-251; 059-964-163-231-020; 061-120-521-431-711; 062-430-641-482-45X; 063-711-913-279-795; 064-358-324-992-439; 066-960-909-407-818; 069-844-031-266-949; 072-063-991-073-091; 072-091-736-511-718; 073-285-512-960-452; 075-828-593-593-615; 077-283-036-793-142; 081-831-039-847-643; 083-200-399-364-890; 083-554-093-325-125; 084-663-677-867-090; 087-523-328-371-77X; 093-664-764-830-860; 094-152-558-123-679; 098-088-177-206-78X; 104-898-249-163-45X; 116-766-571-877-005; 123-364-141-604-877; 126-058-744-194-022; 127-861-686-752-194; 129-827-356-327-594; 129-855-175-861-34X; 132-191-852-151-951; 133-332-476-170-608; 137-922-867-313-050; 139-351-446-552-527; 145-693-284-325-942; 154-043-951-266-539; 163-771-488-963-464; 166-087-590-007-872,12

Sometimes people make these judgments at a national or international level as nations, multinational organizations, and social action organizations seek to discuss human rights across cultures. Contemporary Western ethics find their origins in discussions of ethics and morality by Immanuel Kant (deontological ethics) and Aristotle (teleological ethics). These and other ethical approaches are certainly relevant to communication scholars and practitioners in general, but those working across cultures face particular ethical dilemmas. Unfortunately, interculturalists often do not discuss ethics, or if they do, they discuss them in a brief and superficial way, which might give way to their own ethical stance to color their understanding of others.</p>;                <p>Those who discuss ethics face a major tension between seeking a single ethical approach that applies to all cultures (i.e., ethical absolutism) and letting each culture determine its own ethical direction (i.e., cultural relativism, one form of the broader notion of ethical relativism). Various authors have proposed deriving a stance from what ethical stances seem to be universal, much as the United Nations Declaration of Human Rights seems to do. Others propose peace or humanitarian ethics that would leave most cultural elements alone in other cultures, but speak when actions, policies, or social situations work against the human dignity of individuals.</p>;                <p>Jürgen Habermas, on the other hand, proposes that people seek ideal speech situations, where people can have open dialogue without restraints, such as power differentials. Finally, as a way out of the ethical maze, others have proposed a dialogic or communicative approach that is not relative, but with which people involved in ethical decisions enter discussions with each other, often considering a wide array of contextual factors that might affect ethical outcomes.</p>",,,,,Sociology; Cultural relativism; Morality; Ideal speech situation; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://communication.oxfordre.com/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-503 https://oxfordre.com/communication/view/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.001.0001/acrefore-9780190228613-e-503,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.503,,10.1093/acrefore/9780190228613.013.503,2802722175,,0,,4

Shaw; Wesley Kerr; Nicki Reed,"Comparative judgment in assessment is a process whereby repeated comparison of two items (e.g., assessment answers) can allow an accurate ranking of all the submissions to be achieved. In adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ), technology is used to automate the process and present pairs of pieces of work over iterative cycles. An online ACJ system was used to present students with work prepared by a previous cohort at the same stage of their studies. Objective marks given to the work by experienced faculty were compared to the rankings given to the work by a cohort of veterinary students (n=154). Each student was required to review and judge 20 answers provided by the previous cohort to a free-text short answer question. The time that students spent on the judgment tasks was recorded, and students were asked to reflect on their experiences after engaging with the task. There was a strong positive correlation between student ranking and faculty marking. A weak positive correlation was found between the time students spent on the judgments and their performance on the part of their own examination that contained questions in the same format. Slightly less than half of the students agreed that the exercise was a good use of their time, but 78% agreed that they had learned from the process. Qualitative data highlighted different levels of benefit from the simplest aspect of learning more about the topic to an appreciation of the more generic lessons to be learned.",44,4,686,691,Mathematics education; Psychology; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Positive correlation; Short answer; Peer assessment; Literacy; Cohort; Social psychology; Qualitative property,assessment literacy; comparative judgment; feedback; peer assessment,"Education, Veterinary/methods; Feedback; Humans; Internet; Judgment; Self-Evaluation Programs; Students, Medical/psychology; Surveys and Questionnaires",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28581915 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28581915/ https://jvme.utpjournals.press/doi/abs/10.3138/jvme.0616-113R https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/files/28427448/2111_1_merged_1470994385.pdf https://www.research.ed.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/adaptive-comparative-judgement-a-tool-to-support-students-assessment-literacy(aed79648-f21a-4386-b980-e2ba4c19fdad).html https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20183033049 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/28581915 http://eprints.gla.ac.uk/156000/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/jvme.0616-113r,28581915,10.3138/jvme.0616-113r,2622935668,,0,,1

Experiments 1-4 tested if mood affects comparative optimism using a mood manipulation that minimized experimenter demand. While the procedure was successful in inducing mood, we found no evidence for a mood effect on comparative optimism. The absence of a mood effect was not due to participants correcting their judgments in response to a presumed mood bias (Experiments 2, 3 and 4) or to participants proactively regulating their mood (Experiments 3 and 4). Experiment 5 compared the mood manipulation of Experiments 1-4 with an autobiographical recall procedure.

In this judgement process, assessors are presented with two pieces of student work and are asked to choose which one is better in relation to the competencies being assessed. However, since student work is heterogeneous and highly information loaded, it raises the question as to whether this type of assessment is too complex for assessors to use. Previous research on the topic has operationalized experienced complexity by employing self-report measures, which have been criticized for common problems associated with their use. In our study, we used eye tracking to study 23 high school teachers when they made 10 comparative judgments, and their pupil diameter was used as an indicator of the experienced complexity. This study builds on previous research that integrated Campbell’s theory on task complexity (1988) into CJ. Based on this framework, three hypotheses regarding the role of decision accuracy were formulated and empirically tested. Hypothesis one assumes that the distance between two pieces of student work on the rank-order (rank-order distance) is negatively related to experienced complexity, irrespective of decision accuracy. Hypothesis two assumes that decision accuracy moderates the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity. Hypothesis three builds on hypothesis two by adding a negative relationship between experience and experienced complexity. In all three hypotheses, the average experienced complexity is assumed to vary between assessors, as is the strength of the expected relationships. An information-theoretic approach was used to test the holding of all three hypotheses. All hypotheses were translated into statistical models, and their relative and absolute fit were assessed. Results provided strong evidence for hypothesis three: both the moderating role of decision accuracy on the relationship between rank-order distance and experienced complexity, and the relationship between experience and experienced complexity, were confirmed.",5,,,,Competence (human resources); Statistical model; Psychology; Negative relationship; Cognitive psychology; As is; Judgement; Argumentative; Eye tracking; Operationalization,,,,Agentschap voor Innovatie door Wetenschap en Technologie,https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2020.582800/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2020.582800,,10.3389/feduc.2020.582800,3128062472,,0,005-409-689-895-137; 006-697-130-958-147; 007-386-871-650-113; 008-515-844-318-494; 011-261-050-123-936; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-294-984-590-568; 024-205-010-922-309; 024-852-157-524-365; 030-068-616-885-927; 030-442-137-998-032; 032-709-967-155-328; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-980-996-015-137; 040-241-846-826-833; 044-962-236-204-557; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 054-800-256-766-777; 064-467-288-573-407; 066-908-670-161-319; 073-572-324-447-872; 074-865-908-583-70X; 079-266-564-904-30X; 079-837-323-682-087; 081-952-102-948-393; 085-408-776-824-254; 090-708-179-854-194; 095-590-706-989-383; 097-113-961-809-678; 101-848-247-761-283; 102-955-514-174-383; 105-060-972-080-52X; 105-761-216-852-813; 107-790-959-417-375; 117-610-732-777-853; 121-161-560-636-803; 126-454-221-798-016; 134-232-387-715-678; 148-673-033-661-432; 151-139-760-758-941; 167-275-555-617-549; 173-829-995-279-749,0

Human perception and performance,19391277; 00961523,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,William M. Hayes; Douglas H. Wedell; Matthew A. Rashotte,"Studies of tempo perception suggest that exposure to a distribution of predominantly faster or slower versions of a song can shift one's memory for the original tempo toward the contextual tempos. Three experiments were conducted to examine whether similar assimilation effects would occur when participants are asked to reproduce the tempo of a song from memory. In Experiments 1 and 2, participants listened to a tempo-altered version of a pop song prior to tapping out the original tempo from memory on each trial. Reproduced tempos assimilated toward the immediately preceding tempo, but there was no evidence of global assimilation toward the mean of the distribution of tempos. However, Experiment 2 demonstrated a partial dissociation between perception and production, with the same participants showing large assimilation effects derived from comparative judgments but not from tempo reproduction. In Experiment 3, participants listened to and then tapped out the beat of a tempo-altered version before reproducing the original from memory on each trial, which resulted in a global assimilation effect in reproduction. The results of these experiments highlight that contextual bias in memory for tempo depends on the match between the context and the task, with differential effects for perceptual and motor contexts.

Fairchild,"A psychophysical experiment was performed examining the effect of luminance and chromatic noise on perceived image quality. The noise was generated in a recently developed isoluminant opponent space. 5 spatial frequency octave bands centered at 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32 cycles-per-degree (cpd) of visual angle were generated for each of the luminance, red-green, and blue-yellow channels. Two levels of contrast at each band were examined. Overall there were 30 images and 1 ""original"" image. Four different image scenes were used in a paired-comparison experiment. Observers were asked to select the image that appears to be of higher quality.; 	The paired comparison data were used to generate interval scales of image quality using Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgments. These interval scales provide insight into the effect of noise on perceived image quality. Averaged across the scenes, the original noise-free image was determined to be of highest quality. While this result is not surprising on its own, examining several of the individual scenes shows that adding low-contrast blue-yellow isoluminant noise does not statistically decrease image quality and can result in a slight increase in quality.",5668,,82,89,Spatial frequency; Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Octave; Chromatic scale; Visual angle; Paired comparison; Computer vision; Mathematics; Image quality; Luminance,,,,,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5668/1/The-effect-of-opponent-noise-on-image-quality/10.1117/12.587384.full https://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/johnson/pub/noise_ei2004_sm.pdf https://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=857827,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.587384,,10.1117/12.587384,1985267094,,0,007-421-076-151-869; 046-600-555-187-39X; 050-653-296-791-042; 054-703-171-478-528; 094-870-583-641-191; 113-841-490-444-660,10

Many have argued that this susceptibility is a sign of unreliability and that this poses a methodological challenge for moral philosophy. Recently, doubt has been cast on this idea. It has been argued that extant evidence of framing effects does not show that moral intuitions have an unreliability problem. I argue that, even if the extant evidence suggests that moral intuitions are fairly stable with respect to what intuitions we have, the effect of framing on the strength of those intuitions still needs to be taken into account. I argue that this by itself poses a methodological challenge for moral philosophy.",29,6,904,911,Experimental philosophy; Epistemology; Framing effect; Philosophical methodology; Metaphilosophy; Psychology; Moral psychology; Social cognitive theory of morality; Moral disengagement; Moral reasoning,,,,,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/66006/ https://philpapers.org/archive/ANDRBN.pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/ANDRBN-3 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2016.1168794 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/09515089.2016.1168794 http://centaur.reading.ac.uk/51203/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/146460679.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/09515089.2016.1168794,,10.1080/09515089.2016.1168794,2293595797,,0,005-332-312-583-683; 005-708-845-699-649; 007-559-410-041-940; 015-664-419-631-394; 015-734-197-095-434; 018-591-667-690-937; 019-220-504-766-558; 019-479-044-480-737; 022-781-572-869-549; 026-653-600-286-99X; 027-640-839-489-848; 028-215-361-128-961; 048-007-773-064-596; 048-599-371-422-110; 056-388-486-343-404; 058-557-117-905-560; 065-972-725-643-121; 067-737-370-037-706; 098-667-309-575-904; 099-144-950-889-718; 110-133-153-096-638; 134-214-480-132-849; 143-578-098-623-069; 143-651-440-320-070; 145-811-324-331-12X; 158-579-512-038-287; 161-753-417-641-829; 167-793-053-484-926; 169-414-039-204-625; 173-155-352-444-079; 185-508-720-277-961,8

Carrasco, S. Ling, & S. Read, 2004), observers selected one of two Gabors that appeared to have higher contrast (comparative judgment). A peripheral cue preceded one of the Gabors by 120 ms. Results showed that the cue increased the perceived contrast of the adjacent Gabor. We replicated the experiment and found correlations between the precision of judgments and perceptual cueing effects. Larger cueing effects occurred in conditions with less precise judgments and in observers who saw less difference between the stimuli. Further, we asked observers to judge whether the two Gabors were equal or different (equality judgment). This method avoids decision biases but turned out to be less efficient. Cueing effects were absent for equality judgments and trained observers but present for untrained observers with poor ability to discriminate the stimuli. In another experiment, we showed that when observers' responses became more rapid over the course of the experiment, a cueing effect in brightness perception emerged that is unlikely to reflect perceptual changes.

By Mixed Nested Logit model we mean the model which combines the mixed logit with the nested logit estimated simultaneously. Results reveal the presence of both correlation (addressed by the nested logit model) and different taste heterogeneity (addressed by the mixed logit model). The estimation results for the combined mixed nested logit model is presented compared with individual estimation results for nested logit on its own, mixed logit on its own and multinomial logit. This paper is unique in that there does not seem to be much work in using this combined mixed nested logit model approach to understanding long distance travellers’ behaviour in the context of road pricing. This paper opens up this area for investigation and shows the additional explanation we can potentially achieve to improve our models forecasting ability.",1,1,24,35,Multinomial logistic regression; Logit; Econometrics; Economics; Willingness to pay; Road pricing; Toll; Toll road; Ordered probit; Mixed logit,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146514000052 https://core.ac.uk/display/82061475 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146514000052 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82061475.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2014.07.004,,10.1016/j.trpro.2014.07.004,2021232259,,0,004-955-765-542-299; 008-159-370-919-678; 009-725-759-362-345; 010-809-633-087-177; 012-065-370-685-872; 022-530-311-151-815; 025-271-819-261-797; 026-298-384-101-255; 028-871-247-313-798; 029-135-457-418-636; 030-159-884-660-285; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-100-112-870-141; 037-539-711-063-369; 037-748-719-206-441; 042-627-416-303-850; 042-751-741-052-90X; 052-115-081-225-099; 052-217-341-775-087; 053-198-154-681-152; 057-657-809-679-383; 069-078-163-183-58X; 072-298-723-280-04X; 075-725-207-748-825; 082-428-789-334-720; 089-329-720-515-073; 091-326-683-097-72X; 107-789-313-226-600; 124-628-909-501-502; 125-977-799-521-773; 128-315-979-589-27X; 135-607-100-530-655; 152-774-271-995-988; 176-983-121-289-473; 180-508-588-026-935; 184-845-311-102-387,3

Thus, the study was conducted as mixed-methods research. For the sample of the qualitative phase, 42 8th and 9th grade students who studied at different types of public schools, also 15 teachers who worked at the same schools were selected. The sample in the quantitative phase constituted of 336 8th and 397 9th grade students, plus 130 8th and 139 9th grade teachers. To gather qualitative data, a composition instruction and semi-structured interviews were used. Then, scaling forms for students and teachers were developed in accordance with the qualitative data. The qualitative data was analyzed with the content analysis technique. In the analysis of the ranked data, ""Thurstone's law of comparative judgments"" and ""the composite standard"" solutions were used. The stimulus of ""constantly and rapidly changes in the transition to secondary education"" was scaled as the most significant problem by 8thgrade students and teachers. ""Not allocating time for leisure time activities"" stimulus was evaluated as the most crucial problem by 9th grade students. Rankings of the stimuli were more consistent in terms of the independent variables, in 8th graders’ judgments. However, according to 9th grade students’ judgments, there was less similarity in rankings for both gender and school type variables. Besides, according to the judgments of teachers, rankings descriptively differed in terms of the branch and seniority level variables.",13,1,57,75,Mathematics education; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Content analysis; Ranking; Variables; Secondary education; Leisure time; Qualitative property; Scaling,,,,,https://iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/download/1100/485 https://iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/view/1100,https://iejee.com/index.php/IEJEE/article/view/1100,,,3121082393,,0,,0

Stringham; Elisabeth E. Mulroy; Jinchuan Xing; David Record; Michael W Guernsey; Jaclyn T. Aldenhoven; Edward J. Osborne; Michael D. Shapiro,"Summary Domestic pigeons are spectacularly diverse and exhibit variation in more traits than any other bird species [1]. In The Origin of Species, Charles Darwin repeatedly calls attention to the striking variation among domestic pigeon breeds— generated by thousands of years of artificial selection on a single species by human breeders—as a model for the process of natural divergence among wild populations and species [2]. Darwin proposed a morphology-based classification of domestic pigeon breeds [3], but the relationships among major groups of breeds and their geographic origins remain poorly understood [4, 5]. We used a large, geographically diverse sample of 361 individuals from 70 domestic pigeon breeds and two free-living populations to determine genetic relationships within this species. We found unexpected relationships among phenotypically divergent breeds as well as convergent evolution of derived traits among several breed groups. Our findings also illuminate the geographic origins of breed groups in India and the Middle East and suggest that racing breeds have made substantial contributions to feral pigeon populations.",22,4,302,308,Feral pigeon; Breed; Genetic Speciation; Domestic pigeon; Columbidae; Convergent evolution; Genetic variation; Evolutionary biology; Biology; Zoology; Phylogeography,,Animals; Biological Evolution; Breeding; Columbidae/anatomy & histology; Genetic Speciation; Genetic Variation; Microsatellite Repeats; Molecular Sequence Data; Phenotype; Phylogeography,,NIGMS NIH HHS (T32GM007464) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (K99 HG005846-01) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM007464-35) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (K99 HG005846) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM007464-34) United States; NIGMS NIH HHS (T32 GM007464) United States; NHGRI NIH HHS (K99HG005846) United States,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3288640 https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(11)01458-8 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211014588 https://core.ac.uk/display/81936075 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22264611 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20123098204 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22264611/ https://www.researchwithrutgers.com/en/publications/divergence-convergence-and-the-ancestry-of-feral-populations-in-t https://www.cell.com/current-biology/abstract/S0960-9822%2811%2901458-8 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211014588 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81936075.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.045,22264611,10.1016/j.cub.2011.12.045,1983704731,PMC3288640,0,009-162-112-601-927; 011-248-468-537-38X; 012-469-789-655-470; 012-471-208-328-811; 014-678-222-839-336; 016-282-781-129-447; 019-617-750-016-977; 021-019-012-966-622; 023-426-843-960-345; 024-885-176-862-045; 025-097-405-987-685; 043-597-821-250-715; 047-243-759-907-866; 053-032-118-881-210; 057-677-516-596-670; 062-517-376-972-424; 066-919-082-268-543; 076-397-903-837-641; 084-176-341-152-384; 091-705-908-709-046; 106-042-451-652-147; 109-839-702-174-846; 144-711-494-399-499; 152-016-979-412-95X; 153-953-331-551-378; 157-351-975-138-383,47

In most cases, the selection process involves multiple conflicting criteria that can be either qualitative or quantitative in nature. The use of multiple attribute decision making (MADM) technique thus has been proven effective in providing a transparent, systematic and rational approach to problem solving. In this study, a variant of the widely used MADM technique known as the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) has been developed and applied for the selection of low-carbon technologies. This approach enables the selection of optimal alternative by incorporating not only the judgment of domain experts but also their degree of confidence through the use of fuzzy numbers for the pairwise comparison ratios in the AHP decision framework. The proposed fuzzy AHP then determines a set of crisp weights that maximizes the degree of consistency of all judgments taken together. The said approach can also derive crisp weights from an incomplete fuzzy pairwise comparative judgment matrix (PCJM). To illustrate the technique, a case study involving comparison of electricity storage technologies for renewable energy systems is considered. This selection problem is important due to the intermittent nature of many forms of renewable energy, which thus require cost-effective auxiliary energy storage subsystems for successful deployment.",45,,1141,1146,Software deployment; Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Work in process; Analytic network process; Pairwise comparison; Fuzzy number; Reliability engineering; Computer science; Fuzzy logic; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.cetjournal.it/index.php/cet/article/view/CET1545191,https://www.cetjournal.it/index.php/cet/article/view/CET1545191,,,2624061819,,0,,10

The goal of the competition was to automatically evaluate five “apparent” personality traits (the so-called “Big Five”) from videos of subjects speaking in front of a camera, by using human judgment. In this edition of the ChaLearn challenge, a novel data set consisting of 10,000 shorts clips from YouTube videos has been made publicly available. The ground truth for personality traits was obtained from workers of Amazon Mechanical Turk (AMT). To alleviate calibration problems between workers, we used pairwise comparisons between videos, and variable levels were reconstructed by fitting a Bradley-Terry-Luce model with maximum likelihood. The CodaLab open source platform was used for submission of predictions and scoring. The competition attracted, over a period of 2 months, 84 participants who are grouped in several teams. Nine teams entered the final phase. Despite the difficulty of the task, the teams made great advances in this round of the challenge.",,,400,418,Machine learning; First impression (psychology); Ground truth; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Natural language processing; CLIPS; Big Five personality traits; Human judgment; Open source; Computer science; Maximum likelihood,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_32 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/eccv/eccv2016w3.html#Ponce-LopezCOCC16 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01381149 https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_32 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-49409-8_32,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_32,,10.1007/978-3-319-49409-8_32,2573933330,,0,000-203-627-584-442; 002-318-312-869-972; 005-638-846-150-569; 017-513-519-437-518; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-233-013-143-936; 023-805-082-979-008; 028-865-012-864-391; 030-058-758-820-724; 032-642-224-830-800; 037-361-237-331-665; 042-345-245-527-503; 043-022-952-629-736; 044-076-744-226-318; 045-671-292-372-287; 049-076-801-598-313; 050-393-082-230-92X; 053-094-537-530-97X; 054-355-002-132-384; 056-753-667-055-092; 057-622-111-914-708; 062-748-264-120-815; 064-793-923-359-009; 065-173-397-223-038; 065-380-008-922-153; 071-140-872-273-904; 072-149-582-940-972; 073-900-095-327-93X; 075-903-479-966-34X; 080-566-324-651-825; 082-725-214-180-397; 084-567-325-368-722; 084-705-028-313-787; 087-368-559-834-244; 097-872-123-563-864; 099-274-544-419-361; 099-691-999-891-870; 102-277-409-869-888; 114-283-929-434-825; 120-534-296-496-815; 127-168-623-184-438; 135-592-351-179-653; 136-596-225-649-76X,76

Mokhtarian,"Abstract This study uses latent class modeling (LCM) to explore the effects of channel-specific perceptions, along with other variables, on purchase channel intention. Using data on book purchases collected from an Internet-based survey of two university towns in Northern California, we develop a latent class model with two segments (final N =373). Age turns out to be the only observed determinant of class membership, and in the intention model, the mostly-younger segment is more cost-sensitive and the mostly-older segment appears to be more convenience-sensitive. The results clearly demonstrate the effects on purchase intention of channel-specific perceptions, purchase experience, context and sociodemographics. Comparing the LCM to the unsegmented model and to models deterministically segmented on age indicates that the LCM is slightly better from the statistical perspective, but arguably weaker from the conceptual perspective. However, a model that interacts age with the explanatory variables in the conventional unsegmented model outperforms all the others (though not overwhelmingly so), including the LCM. Thus, our results suggest that using LCM as an initial stage in model exploration allows us to more intelligently specify a model where the taste heterogeneity is (potentially) specified deterministically in the end, which often yields a more parsimonious model, and may in fact fit the data better.",2,2,148,172,The Internet; Market segmentation; Econometrics; Communication channel; Marketing; Perception; Class membership; Computer science; Latent class model,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700083 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82774507.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70008-3,,10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70008-3,2024135569,,0,003-189-451-054-886; 010-519-633-552-387; 010-925-548-828-688; 012-971-279-050-889; 016-895-064-712-48X; 020-696-571-742-694; 034-566-366-755-077; 036-006-579-906-008; 041-844-952-518-948; 044-047-092-800-499; 046-335-458-849-158; 048-298-064-060-704; 051-612-558-466-369; 052-859-190-274-844; 056-592-626-899-534; 066-256-225-948-85X; 071-870-990-859-230; 074-120-237-903-306; 075-631-082-315-278; 076-140-751-075-962; 080-099-025-759-174; 080-451-787-236-257; 085-773-527-839-119; 093-861-925-204-733; 103-995-645-569-10X; 116-083-456-307-733; 116-958-338-239-484; 122-185-307-159-890; 132-135-295-127-839; 135-607-100-530-655; 135-614-055-222-420; 137-706-626-190-284; 155-371-029-049-902; 161-174-438-203-522,11

This paper will separately cover environmental features and within-person mental processes. In a third section, we will present a combined perspective, exposing how happiness may be understood as a function of both job and personal characteristics. Finally, avenues for future research are suggested, emphasising the need to distinguish conceptually and empirically between different forms of happiness and unhappiness, given that each one has its own partly distinct sources and consequences. © 2013 Colegio Oficial de Psicologos de Madrid.

In this paper, the popular used shell and tube heat exchangers and plate heat exchangers are selected as candidate heat exchangers for ORC. The detailed parametric and structural models of heat exchangers are formulated. The candidate heat exchangers are optimized and screened under the objective of maximum thermal efficiency (THE), minimum specific cost (SIC) and minimum heat exchanger area per unit power output (APR). Genetic algorithm (GA) is used to solve the model. Then two candidates of ORC schemes with different heat exchangers are screened by fuzzy multi-criteria decision making process.

Culpepper,We present a technique for determining the perceived relative clutter among different images. This experiment involves participants ranking different sets of images in terms of clutter. The law of comparative judgment is then used to determine the relative levels of clutter on the physiological continuum. Also introduced are two metrics for predicting the level of clutter in an image. The first of these metrics uses a graph-based image segmentation algorithm and the second uses the change in gradients across the image. We present how these two metrics along with an existing metric based on wavelets can successfully predict the perceived clutter in an image.,55,11,113106,113106,Image segmentation; Clutter; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Law of comparative judgment; Edge detection; Ranking; Computer vision; Visualization; Computer science; Wavelet; Image processing,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016OptEn..55k3106M/abstract https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/journals/Optical-Engineering/volume-55/issue-11/113106/Clutter-estimation-and-perception/10.1117/1.OE.55.11.113106.full,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/1.oe.55.11.113106,,10.1117/1.oe.55.11.113106,2557909824,,0,000-402-395-272-555; 005-151-854-755-651; 005-611-835-534-532; 008-482-995-772-776; 011-112-894-120-058; 011-565-319-312-32X; 026-024-510-867-30X; 026-340-434-709-047; 029-309-447-663-74X; 030-152-507-489-070; 030-899-547-651-234; 030-955-286-994-039; 031-501-199-797-504; 032-416-223-483-733; 038-572-130-239-101; 039-560-579-651-129; 039-831-153-782-967; 045-617-937-929-904; 048-766-584-513-505; 051-778-375-645-516; 060-875-322-815-578; 070-821-459-707-630; 077-624-443-149-322; 086-798-011-125-649; 086-853-345-500-241; 102-408-504-418-820; 106-689-535-186-072; 119-473-356-570-043; 140-265-352-093-66X; 143-503-042-708-243; 147-123-719-427-840; 172-985-073-330-569; 187-689-024-890-55X,3

However, the evolution of technological solutions has helped the PWDs to accomplish their tasks independently.

In this paper, a quantitative and a qualitative assessment approach for the evaluation of the various technologies is proposed. It measures the applicability of the technological solutions for the different impairment groups.

J. Sangwin,"This chapter reviews current assessments in technical subjects such as science, technology, engineering, mathematics, or computer science in higher education. We consider definitions of success in terms of stated policy aims and defacto examination practice. From this background we examine the rapidly changing nature of learning materials from a static physical textbook to online resources with interactive components. Automatic online assessment is a key component of contemporary online learning. The chapter describes some of the current range of tools, from those targeted as very specific subjects to more general methodologies such as comparative judgement. We consider how these new tools will shape students' work and how this might contribute to, or hinder, their success.",,,111,130,Engineering management; Higher education; Online assessment; Judgement; Online learning; Current range; Assessment design; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-2791-8_7 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-10-2791-8_7,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-10-2791-8_7,,10.1007/978-981-10-2791-8_7,2540112876,,0,001-045-511-632-962; 003-975-422-073-816; 004-297-403-046-093; 009-088-170-458-839; 009-321-890-765-720; 009-799-919-995-822; 011-559-789-630-938; 012-731-620-862-168; 016-279-152-792-986; 016-728-580-578-143; 017-038-246-478-989; 017-976-074-065-053; 018-217-258-407-862; 023-187-522-996-747; 026-530-247-079-040; 026-650-784-068-327; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-649-345-709-115; 042-371-278-379-876; 044-938-902-641-493; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 048-531-718-226-995; 062-617-158-501-42X; 065-826-368-686-16X; 066-908-670-161-319; 078-865-753-368-786; 084-260-700-336-364; 090-419-891-278-249; 100-351-167-798-668; 107-090-894-747-48X; 110-022-666-374-718; 110-990-921-939-498; 128-346-046-461-057; 128-815-318-856-204; 129-874-399-281-524; 130-659-023-734-568; 142-783-994-751-76X; 143-168-292-918-942; 143-944-551-039-82X; 144-076-248-203-243; 149-574-821-306-522; 153-637-930-322-337; 157-176-270-079-488; 157-988-725-742-754; 168-898-100-828-515; 183-465-167-748-448; 187-352-678-161-045,0

Niranjan; Arun Rajkumar,"We study the problem of ranking a set of items from nonactively chosen pairwise preferences where each item has feature information with it. We propose and characterize a very broad class of preference matrices giving rise to the Feature Low Rank (FLR) model, which subsumes several models ranging from the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) (Bradley and Terry 1952) and Thurstone (Thurstone 1927) models to the recently proposed blade-chest (Chen and Joachims 2016) and generic low-rank preference (Rajkumar and Agarwal 2016) models. We use the technique of matrix completion in the presence of side information to develop the Inductive Pairwise Ranking (IPR) algorithm that provably learns a good ranking under the FLR model, in a sample-efficient manner. In practice, through systematic synthetic simulations, we confirm our theoretical findings regarding improvements in the sample complexity due to the use of feature information. Moreover, on popular real-world preference learning datasets, with as less as 10% sampling of the pairwise comparisons, our method recovers a good ranking.",,,,,Matrix (mathematics); Thurstone scale; Preference learning; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Matrix completion; Time complexity; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Sampling (statistics),,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02661 https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.02661 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02661 https://za.arxiv.org/abs/1702.02661 https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02661 https://export.arxiv.org/abs/1702.02661 https://za.arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02661,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1702.02661,,,2950579190,,0,003-868-023-351-977; 007-693-984-669-232; 025-009-658-071-875; 035-776-610-863-582; 050-112-508-265-828; 050-943-988-713-681; 075-331-630-915-975; 079-877-406-165-903; 082-113-058-814-310; 087-991-691-200-809; 097-492-503-037-095; 098-378-936-820-680; 109-634-740-013-008; 116-526-472-417-342; 123-248-831-556-464; 124-783-387-855-855; 128-195-175-916-120; 171-444-262-217-41X,1

This temporal oddball effect (OE) has been attributed to perceptual processes. The OE is usually assessed with a comparative judgment task. It has been argued, however, that this task is prone to decision biases. The present experiments employed comparative and equality judgments, since it has been suggested that equality judgments are less vulnerable to such biases. Experiments 1a and 1b used visual stimuli, and Experiment 2 auditory stimuli. The results provide no strong evidence for decision biases influencing the OE. In addition, computational modeling clearly suggests that the equality judgment is not particularly suited to distinguish between perceptual and decisional effects. Taken together, the pattern of the present results is most consistent with a perceptual origin of the OE.",76,3,814,828,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Visual perception; Cognitive psychology; Oddball paradigm; Perception; Auditory stimuli; Auditory oddball,,Adolescent; Adult; Attention/physiology; Auditory Perception/physiology; Decision Making/physiology; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Middle Aged; Time Factors; Time Perception/physiology; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24435899 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-013-0602-2/fulltext.html https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3285872531/duration-perception-of-visual-and-auditory-oddball https://core.ac.uk/display/56765130 https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-013-0602-2 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/54068,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13414-013-0602-2,24435899,10.3758/s13414-013-0602-2,2003168590,,0,001-156-714-394-37X; 003-166-015-289-337; 003-447-954-237-51X; 003-789-930-388-209; 004-375-154-319-425; 006-068-486-215-537; 007-344-574-109-712; 008-332-118-071-253; 010-214-365-005-928; 010-629-061-233-301; 011-601-854-227-368; 011-709-004-112-470; 014-485-476-529-652; 018-072-219-946-826; 018-092-790-878-47X; 019-782-429-399-042; 019-907-085-939-215; 020-817-359-125-486; 021-529-426-146-704; 022-167-973-790-225; 022-940-740-007-24X; 023-798-072-605-798; 024-215-642-942-26X; 024-403-671-372-719; 025-053-282-361-812; 026-522-501-396-608; 026-853-808-556-49X; 032-272-286-337-565; 042-239-703-175-164; 050-683-379-855-846; 053-183-453-141-357; 054-581-153-094-317; 059-302-063-243-515; 059-794-696-770-335; 062-391-552-594-047; 062-544-389-213-359; 063-443-201-462-614; 065-209-690-748-548; 065-286-413-404-279; 065-513-607-899-801; 066-112-743-844-011; 069-565-712-699-30X; 072-266-931-273-497; 072-682-956-393-922; 074-190-803-868-351; 078-132-340-685-259; 085-659-211-636-965; 096-444-573-511-474; 097-649-832-039-369; 098-206-458-488-079; 099-585-422-592-287; 102-576-473-955-06X; 106-794-720-847-703; 107-062-110-510-516; 126-316-302-682-378; 130-499-292-686-891; 137-170-899-546-909,36

Participants worked on anagrams and were then asked to respond whether a presented word was the solution. They also rated their confidence, either before or after the response and either before or after seeing the suggested solution.

Nystad,"AbstractThis paper considers the problem of erosion in choke valves used on offshore oil platforms. A parameter commonly used to assess the valve erosion state is the flow coefficient, which can be analytically calculated as a function of both measured and allocated parameters. Since the allocated parameter estimation is unreliable, the obtained evaluation of the valve erosion level becomes inaccurate and undermines the possibility of achieving good prognostic results. In this work, cluster analysis is used to verify the allocated parameter values and an ensemble of Kernel Regression models is used to correct the valve flow coefficient estimates.",7,2,225,241,Statistics; Erosion; Prognostics; Flow coefficient; Estimation theory; Marine engineering; Kernel regression; Computational mathematics; Choke; Computer science; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/18756891.2013.874670 https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/18756891.2013.874670 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/18756891.2013.874670 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01787032 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijcisys/ijcisys7.html#BaraldiZMGN14 https://www.atlantis-press.com/journals/ijcis/25868485 https://re.public.polimi.it/handle/11311/967963 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/55253658.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/18756891.2013.874670,,10.1080/18756891.2013.874670,1985843530,,0,001-159-184-276-045; 005-196-741-632-080; 010-768-691-532-509; 020-917-239-451-509; 021-716-208-836-655; 022-961-989-120-128; 032-487-100-948-404; 039-079-278-386-463; 041-404-687-134-724; 045-173-809-237-378; 045-206-185-199-876; 050-167-588-250-404; 055-664-810-663-680; 059-115-138-951-02X; 062-372-996-603-713; 070-756-929-178-481; 076-721-147-063-59X; 077-945-517-360-807; 088-975-785-084-374; 099-942-693-351-285; 099-977-595-034-235; 101-095-259-975-146; 104-329-410-726-539; 107-576-440-952-147; 119-875-378-100-204; 124-923-435-269-140; 145-355-889-376-580; 147-103-066-162-508; 161-355-406-344-446; 174-833-128-176-213,5

Previously, 19 ships were operating in Kamal Port (2008), after the Suramadu Bridge in 2010 there were only three ships. Many traders are losing money. The causes of the Kamal Port have shown: minimal investment, high intensity of land use, decreased economic activity, lack of government policies, lack of regulation on spatial use, poor facilities and services, lack of area management policies, and minimal community participation. The development of the Kamal Port requires directives that are by the ecological, social, and economic conditions of the community. The research objective is to determine the direction of the utilization of the coastal area of the Kamal port after the Suramadu bridge using the AHP method and to determine the environmental conditions of the Kamal Port waters. The method used is the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and the measurement of water quality data compared to quality standards. The AHP stages are: identifying problems, constructing hierarchical structures, making Pairwise Comparative Judgment Matrices, Priority Synthesis, Calculating CR (Consistency Ratio). AHP analysis results get priority to make the Kamal port area for tourism (58%), industry/trade (24.6%), settlement criteria (11.4%) and conservation criteria (6%). The results of measurements of the average water quality parameters DO (4.39 mg / l), pH (7.2), salinity (28), phosphate (5.53 mg / l), nitrate (0.1073 mg / l) and lead (0.0265 mg / l).

Reproductions or bisections of visual lines may differ considerably among subjects (Brown, 1953; Fischer, 1994; Manning, Halligan, & Marshall, 1990; Ogle, 1950; Takala, 1951). These differences could depend on the comparison of lengths in such tasks. Errors in comparative judgment are called space errors when they depend on the different position in space of the compared stimuli (Guilford, 1954). The following experiments were designed to test whether individual differences in space errors for line length occur and whether these differences persist.",,,,,Stimulus (physiology); Line length; Mathematics; Social psychology,,,,,,,,,2554556566,,0,024-647-452-841-619; 039-789-148-512-296; 046-751-790-643-154; 070-372-358-207-628; 097-142-058-803-475,1

Flynn; Elisabeth Huynh; Timothy J. Peters; Hareth Al-Janabi; Sam Clemens; Alison Moody; Joanna Coast,"This paper reports the results of a best–worst scaling (BWS) study to value the Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults (ICECAP-A), a new capability measure among adults, in a UK setting. A main effects plan plus its foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that ‘attachment’ and ‘stability’ each account for around 22% of the space, and ‘autonomy’, ‘achievement’ and ‘enjoyment’ account for around 18% each. Across all attributes, greater value was placed on the difference between the lowest levels of capability than between the highest. This tariff will enable ICECAP-A to be used in economic evaluation both within the field of health and across public policy generally. © 2013 The Authors.

104-642-999-567-323,The Rational Side of Egocentrism in Social Comparisons,,2006,journal article,SSRN Electronic Journal,15565068,Elsevier BV,,Justin Kruger; Paul D. Windschitl; John R. Chambers; Jeremy Burrus; Florian Fessel,"Prior work has found that when people compare themselves with others they egocentrically focus on their own strengths and contributions and pay less attention to strengths and contributions of the comparison group. As a consequence, individuals tend to overestimate their comparative standing when absolute standing is high and underestimate their comparative standing when absolute standing is low. The present research investigated a rational interpretation of this bias  namely, that people are egocentrically focused because they have more knowledge about themselves than about others. Support for this hypothesis was found in three studies, one concerning comparative judgments of responsibility and two others concerning confidence in competitions. These results suggest that there is a rational side to egocentrism in social comparisons.",,,,,Psychology; Egocentrism; Social comparison theory; Self-assessment; Self-enhancement; Overconfidence effect; Social psychology,,,,,https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=946232 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID946232_code688478.pdf?abstractid=946232&mirid=5 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID946232_code688478.pdf?abstractid=946232&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=946232,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.946232,,10.2139/ssrn.946232,2136005466,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 003-498-762-032-886; 005-485-876-843-169; 005-553-153-856-945; 007-778-725-444-103; 012-419-306-168-454; 020-384-343-414-258; 020-696-840-914-301; 022-940-056-786-160; 023-788-636-008-624; 029-207-492-909-748; 030-123-718-813-763; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-152-939-514-535; 055-774-681-121-478; 061-208-460-749-705; 063-469-126-712-446; 065-351-381-849-959; 065-688-149-501-185; 066-362-433-635-072; 066-756-583-866-169; 072-510-801-907-465; 082-662-120-833-072; 088-843-309-043-438; 090-023-370-872-145; 091-357-777-231-24X; 100-593-529-191-989; 105-638-537-991-116; 107-854-421-865-889; 111-659-884-856-63X; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-762-136-028-844; 124-656-535-257-223; 129-131-565-706-173; 144-761-388-431-083; 148-223-435-969-407; 163-413-656-134-535; 163-569-396-472-394; 165-707-840-836-402; 181-166-614-027-51X; 188-609-138-424-593,28

Evidence for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers.",2016-08-31,2016,journal article,Social science & medicine (1982),18735347; 02779536,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Jonathan Sicsic; Nicolas Krucien; Carine Franc,"General practitioners (GPs) play a key role in the delivery of preventive and screening services for breast, cervical, and colorectal cancers. In practice, GPs' involvement varies considerably across types of cancer and among GPs, raising important questions about the determinants of GPs' implication in screening activities: what is the relative impact of financial and non-financial incentives? Are GPs' preferences for financial and non-financial incentives cancer-specific? Is there preference heterogeneity and how much does it differ according to the screening context? This study investigates the determinants of GPs' involvement in cancer screening activities using the discrete choice experiment (DCE) methodology. A representative sample of 402 GPs' was recruited in France between March and April 2014. Marginal rates of substitution were used to compare GPs' preferences for being involved in screening activities across three types of cancers: breast, cervical, and colorectal. Variability of preferences was investigated using Hierarchical Bayes mixed logit models. The results indicate that GPs are sensitive to both financial and non-financial incentives, such as a compensated training and systematic transmission of information about screened patients, aimed to facilitate communication between doctors and patients. There is also evidence that the level and variability of preferences differ across screening contexts, although the variations are not statistically significant on average. GPs appear to be relatively more sensitive to financial incentives for being involved in colorectal cancer screening, whereas they have higher and more heterogeneous preferences for non-financial incentives in breast and cervical cancers. Our study provides new findings for policymakers interested in prioritizing levers to increase the supply of cancer screening services in general practice.",167,,116,127,Finance; Cancer; Bayes' theorem; Cancer screening; Incentive; Financial incentives; Discrete choice experiment; Global Positioning System; Medicine; Mixed logit,Cancer screening; Discrete choice experiment; Economic incentives; France; Hierarchical bayes; Mixed logit; Preference heterogeneity,Adult; Bayes Theorem; Breast Neoplasms/diagnosis; Choice Behavior; Colorectal Neoplasms/diagnosis; Early Detection of Cancer/economics; Female; Financial Support; France; General Practitioners/psychology; Humans; Male; Mass Screening/economics; Middle Aged; Motivation; Surveys and Questionnaires; Uterine Cervical Neoplasms/diagnosis,,Chief Scientist Office (HERU1) United Kingdom,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27619755 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/what-are-gps-preferences-for-financial-and-non-financial-incentiv https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277953616304865 http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/9245 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27619755/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v167y2016icp116-127.html https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:socmed:v:167:y:2016:i:c:p:116-127 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/131024547.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.08.050,27619755,10.1016/j.socscimed.2016.08.050,2515200710,,0,000-535-520-240-384; 004-104-583-718-032; 005-283-388-716-982; 007-810-732-491-861; 008-507-014-326-479; 009-235-815-817-016; 009-487-487-962-601; 013-081-429-567-536; 013-813-279-154-883; 015-020-800-669-320; 015-249-323-980-620; 023-847-033-521-266; 025-005-557-378-685; 025-109-351-361-630; 029-441-387-010-197; 029-996-302-519-744; 031-394-590-968-707; 032-362-556-695-186; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-604-155-316-506; 040-583-529-716-526; 041-341-979-184-04X; 042-048-784-647-204; 052-596-514-596-910; 052-656-303-153-10X; 053-020-299-007-881; 057-657-809-679-383; 061-770-592-297-155; 068-963-831-455-639; 069-615-467-269-252; 071-674-642-056-169; 074-645-190-644-993; 078-490-013-331-832; 079-433-913-951-143; 084-449-535-355-412; 084-756-637-231-330; 085-138-376-626-614; 098-376-587-660-420; 098-887-392-019-662; 112-181-931-136-683; 117-632-179-483-231; 119-219-868-308-301; 120-856-193-188-774; 121-784-942-252-048; 122-184-812-699-236; 140-376-704-399-905; 141-426-948-465-453; 144-526-900-314-186; 150-535-545-409-691; 151-018-605-721-726; 152-000-136-529-870; 158-835-518-167-856; 160-441-821-953-411; 164-260-106-908-120; 188-976-857-076-69X,6

We scanned subjects with fMRI while they compared stimuli for size, luminance, or number. Regions involved in comparative judgments were identified using three criteria: task-related activation, presence of a distance effect, and interference of one dimension onto the other. We observed considerable overlap in the neural substrates of the three comparison tasks. Interestingly, the amount of overlap predicted the amount of cross-dimensional interference: in both behavior and fMRI, number interfered with size, and size with luminance, but number did not interfere with luminance.

Lo,"<jats:p> We propose a single evolutionary explanation for the origin of several behaviors that have been observed in organisms ranging from ants to human subjects, including risk-sensitive foraging, risk aversion, loss aversion, probability matching, randomization, and diversification. Given an initial population of individuals, each assigned a purely arbitrary behavior with respect to a binary choice problem, and assuming that offspring behave identically to their parents, only those behaviors linked to reproductive success will survive, and less reproductively successful behaviors will disappear at exponential rates. When the uncertainty in reproductive success is systematic, natural selection yields behaviors that may be individually sub-optimal but are optimal from the population perspective; when reproductive uncertainty is idiosyncratic, the individual and population perspectives coincide. This framework generates a surprisingly rich set of behaviors, and the simplicity and generality of our model suggest that these derived behaviors are primitive and nearly universal within and across species. </jats:p>",1,1,55,108,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9591954.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1142/s201013921100002x,,10.1142/s201013921100002x,,,0,000-666-036-679-918; 001-522-440-498-100; 004-891-731-462-960; 004-966-477-205-291; 005-102-072-066-48X; 005-371-784-645-645; 005-553-153-856-945; 009-053-734-145-089; 009-760-271-450-88X; 010-022-327-424-084; 010-630-127-985-820; 011-481-077-632-583; 011-936-112-423-559; 014-020-144-280-90X; 014-288-096-292-216; 016-530-534-898-740; 017-336-088-380-534; 018-001-627-787-66X; 018-922-188-037-862; 019-397-549-016-631; 020-693-998-764-24X; 020-968-981-255-414; 021-231-221-156-384; 021-813-650-201-251; 023-738-464-097-046; 024-332-077-076-17X; 024-605-100-544-658; 024-607-073-123-987; 025-987-612-930-344; 026-410-629-536-44X; 026-792-344-803-088; 027-303-008-900-504; 028-592-939-510-344; 028-950-865-390-710; 032-157-818-433-440; 034-228-242-568-374; 034-548-898-277-230; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-634-242-377-968; 037-673-872-908-614; 037-787-575-272-774; 039-976-653-155-262; 041-659-281-349-623; 042-098-960-819-892; 043-573-251-966-829; 044-828-353-788-232; 045-303-933-200-161; 048-340-767-056-011; 049-915-916-156-042; 050-155-837-305-042; 050-548-625-713-180; 052-971-573-211-98X; 056-524-023-458-903; 058-250-517-059-926; 061-871-987-984-921; 062-060-160-201-092; 062-091-482-382-203; 062-412-251-485-832; 064-398-109-436-348; 065-223-753-302-254; 066-281-861-230-659; 066-362-949-771-921; 067-342-890-125-869; 071-070-120-622-744; 073-636-733-613-448; 080-279-687-649-423; 087-996-943-163-198; 089-065-887-399-485; 090-339-892-024-70X; 090-651-869-396-94X; 092-272-269-302-586; 092-676-482-893-064; 093-613-566-187-966; 096-982-792-680-946; 097-090-529-173-480; 100-289-777-681-729; 110-134-127-144-370; 112-558-283-185-088; 112-981-955-434-605; 113-261-426-919-544; 115-485-579-829-561; 124-811-837-016-844; 132-274-949-260-285; 132-672-633-184-005; 135-930-775-125-682; 136-829-608-278-446; 141-365-254-434-285; 142-472-386-597-641; 148-983-358-494-525; 170-633-860-594-553; 190-624-303-228-420; 196-639-565-639-668,46

This problem has received widespread attention in recent times, especially after the pioneering works of Emmanuel Candes and collaborators. This paper introduces a simple estimation procedure, called Universal Singular Value Thresholding (USVT), that works for any matrix that has ""a little bit of structure."" Surprisingly, this simple estimator achieves the minimax error rate up to a constant factor. The method is applied to solve problems related to low rank matrix estimation, blockmodels, distance matrix completion, latent space models, positive definite matrix completion, graphon estimation and generalized Bradley--Terry models for pairwise comparison.",43,1,177,214,Combinatorics; Nonnegative matrix; Logical matrix; Applied mathematics; Band matrix; Mathematics; Matrix function; Symmetric matrix; Integer matrix; Block matrix; Hollow matrix; Distance matrix; Matrix (mathematics); Covariance matrix; Estimator; Singular value decomposition; Matrix completion; Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Positive-definite matrix; Low-rank approximation,,,,,https://fr.arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1247 https://it.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247 https://arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247 https://za.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247?context=stat https://il.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247?context=stat.TH http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1247 https://128.84.21.199/abs/1212.1247 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1212.1247.pdf https://fr.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247v7 https://au.arxiv.org/abs/1212.1247?context=math.ST,http://dx.doi.org/10.1214/14-aos1272,,10.1214/14-aos1272,1996023858; 3101788906,,0,000-334-521-458-835; 003-321-161-043-914; 004-135-383-805-678; 005-932-334-805-223; 007-766-208-767-539; 009-523-137-527-410; 009-531-466-301-113; 011-275-425-284-080; 011-375-636-405-493; 012-053-975-626-930; 012-383-234-397-810; 013-056-378-792-578; 015-027-124-838-863; 018-211-014-689-579; 020-390-205-591-556; 021-526-803-476-474; 023-784-599-366-888; 024-105-474-484-273; 026-847-411-714-305; 026-915-025-953-190; 028-775-168-397-890; 029-741-200-714-288; 030-448-642-720-987; 031-749-425-362-007; 031-830-169-787-740; 036-541-902-539-59X; 037-543-640-584-918; 038-286-733-238-899; 038-505-525-850-829; 040-395-625-023-262; 046-891-386-938-633; 050-943-988-713-681; 051-181-495-164-002; 051-712-220-067-414; 052-028-840-085-280; 053-010-690-950-291; 053-020-169-364-397; 054-013-791-330-77X; 058-112-548-911-071; 059-095-852-089-988; 060-177-361-971-41X; 060-539-956-363-267; 061-198-094-190-115; 063-137-751-917-120; 063-699-473-470-457; 066-158-609-645-568; 067-126-500-360-171; 068-440-208-613-022; 070-373-874-287-147; 073-955-351-956-70X; 076-093-674-995-474; 078-383-114-806-119; 079-367-665-908-927; 079-877-406-165-903; 081-370-959-105-221; 081-918-625-564-744; 083-605-958-460-527; 085-717-107-116-807; 086-396-376-510-062; 087-351-485-660-85X; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-471-086-291-801; 091-358-754-683-520; 092-798-854-976-238; 092-879-863-572-598; 093-445-128-683-492; 095-343-050-791-375; 099-591-362-848-965; 103-216-946-915-816; 111-358-495-245-06X; 112-448-076-335-648; 113-278-954-446-219; 120-424-874-837-080; 120-797-490-077-07X; 125-667-490-657-695; 131-839-470-936-297; 136-385-328-097-574; 138-180-890-920-090; 143-941-193-904-807; 144-494-309-888-082; 145-069-531-384-730; 147-158-653-112-204; 147-438-288-702-105; 148-365-958-456-41X; 152-760-702-983-990; 160-456-988-686-652; 163-505-916-525-208; 172-372-363-323-541; 174-579-078-098-366; 175-299-760-379-435; 178-488-793-385-921; 183-818-686-203-950,333

A Simple and Effective Approach to Active Preference Learning,2017-07-17,2017,conference proceedings,,,,,Lucas Maystre; Matthias Grossglauser,"We address the problem of learning a ranking by using adaptively chosen pairwise comparisons. Our goal is to recover the ranking accurately but to sample the comparisons sparingly. If all comparison outcomes are consistent with the ranking, the optimal solution is to use an efficient sorting algorithm, such as Quicksort. But how do sorting algorithms behave if some comparison outcomes are inconsistent with the ranking? We give favorable guarantees for Quicksort for the popular Bradley-Terry model, under natural assumptions on the parameters. Furthermore, we empirically demonstrate that sorting algorithms lead to a very simple and effective active learning strategy: repeatedly sort the items. This strategy performs as well as state-of-the-art methods (and much better than random sampling) at a minuscule fraction of the computational cost.",70,,2344,2353,Sorting algorithm; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Preference learning; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Active learning; Quicksort; Computer science; sort; Sampling (statistics),,,,,http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/maystre17a/maystre17a.pdf https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/229163 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=3305923 http://proceedings.mlr.press/v70/maystre17a.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/icml/icml2017.html#MaystreG17,https://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/229163,,,2964287878,,0,,16

Having defined these two dimensions, we then present the results of a research program conducted to explore the relationship between them. In general, using both experimental and correlational data, we find evidence of a compensation effect between the two dimensions when two targets are compared. That is, when one target is judged more positively on one of the two fundamental dimensions, the second is judged more positively on the other dimension. We show that this compensation effect is confined to these two fundamental dimensions rather than something that more broadly characterises comparative judgements on any two judgemental dimensions. We then explore the importance of this compensation effect for the formation, maintenance, confirmation, and communication of mixed stereotypes of social groups.",,,,,Competence (human resources); Social perception; Psychology; Social group; Research program; Compensation effect; Social psychology,,,,,https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:152857,https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:152857,,,1778385710,,0,,0

This was part of the wider ‘e-scape’ project (2003-present), which has developed an innovative controlled alternative to design & technology and science public assessment at age 16. Teachers from eight primary schools were trained in the use of an online task-authoring tool to develop and trial assessment activities based on current classroom work. To compile their e-portfolios of assessment evidence, pupils used netbook devices, which afford multi-modal responses (text, drawing, photo, audio, video, spreadsheet) whilst leaving space on pupils’ tables for practical investigations. Once the pupil e-portfolios had been uploaded to the secure e-scape website, teachers assessed them using a ‘comparative judgement’ approach to produce a rank order with a high reliability coefficient. Participant teachers recognised the strength of the e-scape approach in terms of facilitating and managing pupils’ responses to assessment tasks in the classroom, which they successfully adapted to suit primary pedagogy. In particular, the benefits of scaffolding complex assessment tasks through the step-wise e-scape process in the authoring tool represented for some of the teachers a pedagogically significant development in terms of their planning.",22,2,247,263,The Internet; Mathematics education; Educational technology; Mobile device; Educational assessment; Judgement; Portfolio; Computer science; Science education; Technology education,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3/fulltext.html https://www.learntechlib.org/p/64590/ http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/498/ http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/498/1/davies%202012%20assessing%20scientific.pdf https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/assessing-scientific-and-technological-enquiry-skills-at-age-11-u https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ963413 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10798-011-9191-3 https://repository.cardiffmet.ac.uk/handle/10369/7313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3,,10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3,2059030851,,0,002-576-201-501-958; 025-414-450-614-761; 033-185-038-160-466; 034-312-023-741-108; 040-635-579-446-765; 048-311-956-478-536; 080-656-755-453-432; 080-906-522-591-809; 096-660-556-373-774; 098-490-797-549-316; 099-532-206-198-323; 100-687-607-260-140; 103-853-896-798-421; 116-038-810-712-270; 118-281-689-077-414; 131-973-822-467-47X; 134-827-860-297-188; 139-343-106-919-900; 147-739-525-098-407; 151-694-829-780-796; 164-791-656-742-519; 173-768-298-331-939,8

Keulen,"A significant part of Gellius literary strategy in establishing cultural authority is his reinvention of recent past, introducing the Antonine celebrities of Hellenic sophistication as leading characters in his Latin portrayal of contemporary cultural world, a portrayal that associates Gellius claim to authority with the centrality of Roman imperial culture. This chapter discusses the methods by which Gellius strategy of shaping his readers perception of this Roman cultural world and its inhabitants can be illuminated. It illustrates this strategy with some examples from Noctes Atticae, especially the scene in Forum Traiani. On the one hand, Gellius connects his authority with centrality of Roman culture by his use of famous locations. On the other hand, Gellius invites his reader to acknowledge and perceive the centrality of his Roman cultural programme by means of various strategies of perception, encouraging him to enter various processes of mutual comparison and visual and literary analysis.Keywords: Aulus Gellius; authority; Forum Traiani; literary analysis; Noctes Atticae; Roman cultural programme; Roman imperial culture; Roman sites",,,237,267,Literature; Art; Sophistication; Perception; Significant part; Centrality,,,,,https://booksandjournals.brillonline.com/content/books/10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.50 https://brill.com/content/books/10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.50 https://brill.com/view/book/9789047443421/Bej.9789004169869.i-364_012.xml?language=en,http://dx.doi.org/10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.50,,10.1163/ej.9789004169869.i-364.50,898363563,,0,,0

These student theses should together represent 30 ECTS. One common way to implement this requirement is that the student writes two theses, where the first one is a systematic review of earlier research and the second one a more traditional empirical thesis. This article investigates if this new type of student thesis – that is, systematic reviews written by students as the first part of the requirements for teacher qualification, also involves a new kind of assessment practice for the examiners at the teacher education programmes. In the student thesis the student is supposed to demonstrate skills concerning several formal learning aims of the teacher education to obtain their qualifications. These include to follow the development of knowledge within a field and solve problems. The student thesis is not only important for the individual student to obtain qualifications, but has also been used to evaluate the teacher education programmes. Despite its significance for students and schools of education, very little research has been conducted on practices in the assessment of systematic reviews. Earlier research related to assessment of student theses demonstrates the difficulties with agreement in assessment practice. The results from earlier studies regarding the importance of the examiners’ background present a divided picture. While some research point to the examiners’ own subject or experience as important when judging theses, other studies do not.The purpose with this study was to examine if a systematic review, as a new phenomenon at the teacher education programmes, has entailed a new assessment practice for the examiners at the universities. Supervisors and examiners at six universities with teacher education have been interviewed and have also answered a survey concerning these systematic reviews. The interviews were conducted through a combination of comparative judgement and repertory grid technique. The interviews were conducted after the respondents had read 5-8 student theses. In the interviews, criteria which were pointed out as decisive for the quality of a thesis by the respondents were discussed. The survey was a Q-sort survey where the respondents ranked different assessment criteria. A total of 45 criteria from the interviews were ranked from 0-10 by the respondents with respect to how important they are when judging a student thesis.The results demonstrate a width in the assessment repertoire among the respondents. Examiners in the study do not see notable differences between a systematic review and a more traditional student thesis. The reasoning concerning criteria was mostly made on a relatively general level, which could be applied both to systematic reviews and empirical theses. Only 27 per cent of the respondents in the survey set a criterion which was more important for a systematic review. Those differences which were mentioned related to the structure of the thesis, the method and how the relation to research is described. Results suggest that examiners’ assessment criteria is a potentially important area for educational development within schools of education, and would also deserve attention in wider national and international discussions.",24,1,25,45,Psychology; Systematic review; Ranking; Formal learning; Repertory grid; Judgement; Teacher education; General level; Phenomenon; Medical education,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1297442,http://dx.doi.org/10.15626/pfs24.1.03,,10.15626/pfs24.1.03,2942983431,,0,,0

The study used Adaptive Comparative Judgment to determine whether integrated research essays that utilized design thinking were more rhetorically effective (i.e., better attuned to addressing a purpose, audience, and context) than non-integrated English composition research essays. Results showed the non-integrated research essays had a statistically significant better rating than the integrated courses; this finding was counterintuitive to our expectations, therefore we utilized NVivo to conduct a word frequency analysis on judges’ holistic comments to determine strengths and weaknesses of the essays. The word frequency analysis demonstrated writing concepts were much stronger and more effective in a standard composition course. These findings led to the development of three literature-based curriculum and pedagogical changes to ensure that integrated students achieve general education writing outcomes in concert with design thinking principles—something our results showed as lacking significantly in these courses.",,,1,23,Counterintuitive; Design thinking; Mathematics education; Psychology; Educational technology; Writing assessment; General education; Science education; Curriculum; Strengths and weaknesses,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-020-09650-6,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-020-09650-6,,10.1007/s10798-020-09650-6,3119556187,,0,001-501-293-778-301; 002-807-214-431-018; 008-031-819-610-142; 008-480-275-000-074; 011-845-943-097-156; 011-948-343-384-639; 013-888-372-922-687; 016-594-262-985-308; 016-634-297-116-560; 019-749-985-752-877; 020-309-532-368-123; 021-603-472-571-480; 021-815-639-110-470; 022-066-951-009-490; 022-421-580-031-915; 024-593-640-147-754; 030-744-670-332-689; 032-114-441-104-152; 033-498-766-332-569; 034-689-136-329-443; 035-558-357-677-843; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-426-516-197-907; 055-409-664-806-189; 059-388-706-870-345; 059-569-549-998-769; 062-203-246-560-649; 063-749-124-741-047; 063-863-517-456-537; 064-284-514-642-334; 064-290-082-816-724; 065-117-194-043-399; 065-854-078-069-33X; 066-622-143-118-657; 069-348-493-884-36X; 069-872-099-132-179; 072-610-149-469-166; 074-399-622-472-152; 076-479-106-655-748; 076-658-980-731-966; 078-593-453-884-58X; 082-605-722-357-463; 083-807-532-483-305; 085-022-019-606-055; 085-148-926-517-48X; 088-945-129-877-811; 094-397-854-802-92X; 096-306-390-509-27X; 096-694-737-448-662; 100-592-232-025-176; 102-367-701-804-693; 107-096-746-639-636; 107-777-323-573-27X; 109-529-712-690-576; 109-913-382-999-285; 110-720-282-753-522; 113-414-530-226-064; 114-798-924-818-558; 115-939-452-532-043; 119-780-804-465-299; 124-078-044-235-095; 126-454-221-798-016; 135-119-816-282-391; 136-606-604-022-63X; 140-001-470-875-217; 153-048-516-372-202; 163-938-197-264-411; 168-992-674-158-005; 171-324-720-934-998; 173-260-452-071-067; 173-456-394-443-452; 197-477-967-493-902,0

107-041-239-296-132,The Public Intellectual as Agent of Justice: In Search of a Regime,,2006,journal article,Philosophy and Rhetoric,15272079; 00318213,The Pennsylvania State University Press,United States,Steve Fuller,"The public intellectual is ultimately an agent of distributive justice. This sounds strange only if we conceive of justice as pertaining exclusively to relationships among people and things. However, the public intellectual's raison d'etre comes into view once our sense of distributive justice is expanded to cover relationships among ideas and actions. Just as some people enjoy an unearned advantage over others with respect to access to material goods, so too some ideas enjoy an unearned advantage with respect to their capacity to motivate action. In the latter case, this advantage usually results from the accumulation of time and resources to develop ideas sufficiently to render their practical implications ap parent. The advantage is ""unearned"" because it has been acquired at the expense of other ideas whose applicability would become equally apparent, if they were provided with comparable time and resources. Now this way of seeing things presupposes a robust sense of the public as a unitary ""intellectual ecology"" or ""collective attention span,"" which is subject to the usual economic problems of scarcity. It would be difficult to motivate the public intellectual's instinctive sense of justice often expressed as righteous indignation without assuming such scarcity. It forces one to consider which other ideas are marginalized simply because only some can receive adequate support. In other words, the public intellectual's animus is born of the view that ideas are never judged exclusively on their own merits but primarily in relation to other ideas. Often these comparative judgments are made implicitly that is, not by direct reference to the ideas but to those who seem to stand to benefit from their",39,2,147,156,Scarcity; Epistemology; Social exclusion; Sociology; Law and economics; Economic problem; Righteous indignation; Distributive justice; Instinct; If and only if; Unitary state,,,,,http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/33017/ https://www.jstor.org/stable/20697143 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2094245,http://dx.doi.org/10.1353/par.2006.0013,,10.1353/par.2006.0013,2040389795,,0,015-138-467-534-791; 018-154-987-583-692; 025-145-092-563-788; 026-662-780-855-129; 027-989-705-549-237; 031-577-538-873-729; 067-557-133-745-284; 072-729-218-458-136; 073-767-052-211-806; 081-257-228-690-426; 104-185-134-027-538; 109-571-025-506-270; 114-540-471-702-828; 122-801-644-222-084; 131-349-458-501-299; 156-585-941-162-698; 161-478-413-747-884; 195-585-839-258-479; 199-306-345-827-687,11

Herholz; Nikolaos Foroglou; Panagiotis D. Bamidis; Christo Pantev,"This study investigated the cortical responses underlying magnitude comparisons of multisen- sory stimuli and examined the effect that musical expertise has in this process. The comparative judg- ments were based on a newly learned rule binding the auditory and visual stimuli within the context of magnitude comparisons: ""the higher the pitch of the tone, the larger the number presented."" The cortical responses were measured by simultaneous MEGnEEG recordings and a combined source analysis with individualized realistic head models was performed. Musical expertise effects were investigated by com- paring musicians to non-musicians. Congruent audiovisual stimuli, corresponding to the newly learned rule, elicited activity in frontotemporal and occipital areas. In contrast, incongruent stimuli activated tem- poral and parietal regions.

One of the main advantages of a comparative format is that it can reduce faking of responses in high-stakes situations. However, previous research has shown that it is highly difficult to obtain trait score estimates that are both faking resistant and sufficiently accurate for individual-level diagnostic decisions. With the goal of solving this problem, I study the information obtainable from comparative judgments analyzed by means of Thurstonian IRT models. First, I extend the mathematical theory of ordinal comparative judgments and corresponding models. Second, I provide optimal test designs for factor loadings of Thurstonian IRT models from both frequentist and Bayesian statistical perspectives. Third, I derive analytic upper bounds for the accuracy of trait score estimates achievable through these models. Fourth, I perform numerical experiments that complement results obtained in earlier simulation studies. The combined analytical and numerical results suggests that it is indeed possible to design personality tests using comparative judgments that can reduce faking in high-stakes situations while yielding trait scores estimates that are sufficiently accurate for individual-level diagnostic decisions. Recommendations for the practical application of comparative judgments for the measurement of personality, specifically in high-stakes situations, are given.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/j5efn,,10.31234/osf.io/j5efn,,,0,,0

Since the militaries in this region are not always trained to conduct themselves with restraint, the possibility of excesses and human rights violations is always latent. Despite that prospect, there is a high level of public support for military counter-crime interventions throughout the region. The key argument in this article is that when the Latin American public supports military interventions to combat crime, it makes a comparative judgment call about the relative efficacy of military vs. police conduct in domestic security roles. Latin American citizens have very low confidence in the capacity of the police to fight crime effectively and to respect human rights. They place more trust in the armed forces as an institution capable of performing effectively and in accordance with human rights standards and the rule of law. This study develops these arguments in greater detail and then turns to recent Americas Barometer surveys that clearly show that Latin American citizens place more trust in the armed forces than the police as an institution capable of effectively and humanely fighting criminal violence.",9,3,3,26,Latin Americans; Human rights; Political science; Psychological intervention; Rule of law; Relative efficacy; Public support; Criminology,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/46h5c68d https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1866802X1700900301 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1866802X1700900301 https://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/jpla/article/view/1072,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1866802x1700900301,,10.1177/1866802x1700900301,2771213960,,0,000-617-391-728-509; 003-754-204-407-604; 005-009-470-051-033; 006-005-932-680-757; 023-915-464-936-801; 028-651-444-496-859; 046-804-853-308-326; 052-170-441-448-993; 062-156-414-182-925; 067-573-842-888-368; 069-608-019-648-35X; 079-712-971-234-814; 079-713-807-499-081; 081-775-731-128-625; 100-833-488-455-326; 124-046-921-879-161; 125-053-569-064-028; 128-267-583-544-362; 139-193-747-797-092; 164-077-626-601-688; 174-174-401-959-707; 181-256-989-668-486,10

Visual discomfort such as eye strain, headache, fatigue, asthenopia, and other phenomena leading to a less pleasant viewing experience is still a potential issue in S3D applications. How to evaluate S3D image quality that related to visual discomfort is still a challenging problem. A larger number of studies have been done on S3D Image Quality Assessment (S3D IQA) where the subjective assessed S3D Image Databases play an important role. The subjective scores were collected for each S3D image in database with a number of viewers. Usually, Likert scale is adopted for observers to mark their subjective quality score, and then mean opinion score (MOS) is estimated. Due to the law of comparative judgment, the quality of subjective scores varies among observers and depends on the judgment method. This paper studied the quality of two subjective assessment methodologies — single stimulus (SS) and pairwise comparison (PC). Considering the S3D IQA as a S3D images' quality ranking problem, we applied single stimulus and pairwise comparison subjective testing on a set of S3D images with known geometric distortions. From SS subjective testing results, the S3D images' ranking can be derived by sorting MOSs directly. From PC subjective testing results, the ranking can be derived from DMOS scores. The distorted S3D images can be ranked via their geometric distortion parameters. The quality of subjective assessed results from SS and PC are then evaluated on the correlation between their ranking results to corresponding geometric distortions. With the collected MOSs for geometric distorted S3D image database, a deep-learning based S3D IQA model was used to study the relationship between the model performance and the quality of subjective assessment.",,,1,6,Subjective video quality; Stereoscopy; Artificial intelligence; Law of comparative judgment; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Visual Discomfort; Computer vision; Computer science; Image quality; Mean opinion score,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/bmsb/bmsb2017.html#ZhouGZ17 https://doi.org/10.1109/BMSB.2017.7986241,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/bmsb.2017.7986241,,10.1109/bmsb.2017.7986241,2739191954,,0,000-028-542-646-952; 012-225-072-379-009; 013-708-159-315-684; 031-721-934-001-168; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-339-029-984-436; 044-754-659-474-077; 068-668-642-729-889; 094-132-462-634-724; 113-079-030-498-041; 123-067-178-587-539; 172-250-159-558-540; 180-895-240-424-329; 195-927-539-104-010,2

Moreover, both drew on information extracted from the scales in making comparative judgments involving the self. Chinese respondents, however, were less influenced by the response alternatives than were Americans for observable behaviors, both in their behavioral reports and comparative judgments.

Hilbig,"The recognition heuristic (RH) — which predicts non-compensatory reliance on recognition in comparative judgments — has attracted much research and some disagreement, at times. Most studies have dealt with whether or under which conditions the RH is truly used in paired-comparisons. However, even though the RH is a precise descriptive model, there has been less attention concerning the precision of the methods applied to measure RH-use. In the current work, I provide an overview of different measures of RH-use tailored to the paradigm of natural recognition which has emerged as a preferred way of studying the RH. The measures are compared with respect to different criteria — with particular emphasis on how well they uncover true use of the RH. To this end, both simulations and a re-analysis of empirical data are presented.

Introduction The integers constitute an important number class. However, they have been relatively neglected by cognitive scientists. Although there are many studies of natural number processing and rational number processing, there are few if any studies of integer processing. As a result, the cognitive processes and representations that support integer processing are unknown. Research Questions This study addresses three fundamental questions about integer processing, specifically of integer comparison. (1) Are negative integers compared more slowly than positive integers? (2a) Is there a distance effect for negative integers that parallels the distance effect for positive integers (i.e., natural numbers) (Moyer & Landauer, 1967)? (2b) If so, are the distance effects for negative and positive integers comparable? (3a) Is there a Spatial-Numerical Association of Response Codes (SNARC) effect for negative integers that parallels the SNARC effect for positive integers, i.e., that smaller numbers are responded to faster with the left hand and larger numbers with the right hand (Dehaene, Dupoux, & Mehler, 1990)? (3b) If so, are the SNARC effects for negative and positive integers comparable? Method We are currently conducting an experiment that addresses these questions. The paradigm derives from the fMRI experiment by Pinel, Piazza, Le Bihan, and Dehaene (2004). Participants are presented with pairs of integers and must indicate which one is larger by pressing a button. There are two within-subject variables, the valence of the numbers being compared (positive or negative) and the distance between them (near or far). Example stimuli are shown in Table 1. The dependent measures are latency and accuracy. Table 1: Sample Stimuli Valence Positive Negative Near Far Three participants have been run; we are currently in the process of running 13 more. The trends are promising. For example, with respect to question (1), negative numbers are compared more slowly than positive integers (mean difference: 48 msec). With respect to question (2a), there is a distance effect for negative integers, with near distances compared more slowly than far distances (mean difference: 76 msec), and with respect to question (2b) this is comparable to the distance effect observed for positive integers (mean difference: 60 msec). We will perform the appropriate statistical analyses when we finish collecting the data. Conclusion The current study is the first that we know of that examines the processing (i.e., comparison) of negative integers relative to that of positive integers. It promises to illuminate the underlying cognitive processes and representations and, because of its design, lay the groundwork for future neuroimaging studies.

Whereas many previous studies using a comparative judgment have found evidence for such an effect, two recent studies using an equality judgment have not. Critically, these studies have relied on the assumption that the equality paradigm yields bias-free PSE estimates and is as sensitive as the comparative judgment, without testing these assumptions. Anton-Erxleben, Abrams, and Carrasco (2010) compared comparative judgments and equality judgments with and without the manipulation of attention. They demonstrated that the equality paradigm is less sensitive than the comparative judgment and also bias-prone. Furthermore, they reported an effect of attention on the PSE using both paradigms. Schneider (2011) questions the validity of the latter finding, stating that the data in the equality experiment are corrupted because of skew in the response distributions. Notably, this argument supports the original conclusion by Anton-Erxleben et al.: that the equality paradigm is bias-prone. Additionally, the necessary analyses to show that the attention effect observed in Anton-Erxleben et al. was due to skew in the data were not conducted. Here, we provide these analyses and show that although the equality judgment is bias-prone, the effects we observe are consistent with an increase of apparent contrast by attention.",11,13,8,8,Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Spatial vision; Contrast perception; Social psychology,,Attention/physiology; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Cues; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male,,NEI NIH HHS (F32 EY021420) United States; NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY016200) United States,https://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/AntonErxlebenAbramsCarrasco_2011_JoV.pdf http://www.psych.nyu.edu/carrascolab/publications/AntonErxlebenAbramsCarrasco_2011_JoV.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3386898 https://nyuscholars.nyu.edu/en/publications/equality-judgments-cannot-distinguish-between-attention-effects-o https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3386898/ https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2121438,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/11.13.8,22072728,10.1167/11.13.8,2148766824,PMC3386898,0,003-234-688-368-621; 006-890-882-656-98X; 006-974-290-118-596; 010-941-661-113-334; 011-601-854-227-368; 011-921-415-743-507; 013-365-280-541-681; 013-994-093-405-504; 016-619-705-994-528; 018-475-871-856-107; 019-070-518-571-38X; 020-434-770-645-838; 021-131-458-001-390; 021-278-387-745-697; 022-035-864-030-513; 022-908-301-099-074; 024-215-699-434-354; 027-619-459-706-744; 029-521-363-350-314; 030-176-445-621-035; 031-557-912-484-38X; 032-272-286-337-565; 040-142-001-640-064; 041-100-240-098-090; 042-016-862-583-749; 042-513-529-196-857; 044-433-991-525-780; 046-566-945-517-01X; 053-188-997-118-297; 054-581-153-094-317; 055-703-865-683-039; 057-590-452-747-502; 057-952-292-015-18X; 061-493-249-815-530; 063-534-770-531-329; 068-538-601-844-877; 070-393-848-870-898; 070-536-952-301-13X; 072-716-995-023-45X; 079-260-008-550-208; 093-013-174-106-224; 094-795-066-310-768; 097-250-909-662-702; 101-718-592-082-454; 110-975-130-163-122; 112-951-565-313-763; 113-286-538-807-265; 116-035-406-094-913; 121-593-252-566-54X; 123-542-795-941-089; 163-307-707-970-578; 163-648-236-426-263; 171-293-257-714-862; 187-704-606-855-976; 195-656-865-139-575; 198-404-028-450-268,23

Hunt; Behrens Tej.,"Two long-standing traditions have highlighted cortical decision mechanisms in the parietal and prefrontal cortices of primates, but it has not been clear how these processes differ, or when each cortical region may influence behaviour. Recent data from ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) and posterior parietal cortex (PPC) have suggested one possible axis on which the two decision processes might be delineated. Fast decisions may be resolved primarily by parietal mechanisms, whereas decisions made without time pressure may rely on prefrontal mechanisms. Here, we report direct evidence for such dissociation. During decisions under time pressure, a value comparison process was evident in PPC, but not in vmPFC. Value-related activity was still found in vmPFC under time pressure. However, vmPFC represented overall input value rather than compared output value. In contrast, when decisions were made without time pressure, vmPFC transitioned to encode a value comparison while value-related parameters were entirely absent from PPC. Furthermore, under time pressure, decision performance was primarily governed by PPC, while it was dominated by vmPFC at longer decision times. These data demonstrate that parallel cortical mechanisms may resolve the same choices in differing circumstances, and offer an explanation of the diverse neural signals reported in vmPFC and PPC during value-guided choice.",100,100,498,506,Psychology; Neuroscience; Cognitive psychology; Orbitofrontal cortex; Intertemporal choice; Parietal lobe; Ventromedial prefrontal cortex; Prefrontal cortex; Brain mapping; Neuroimaging; Posterior parietal cortex,Decision making; Parietal cortex; Reward; Ventromedial prefrontal cortex; fMRI,Adolescent; Adult; Brain Mapping/methods; Choice Behavior/physiology; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Parietal Lobe/physiology; Prefrontal Cortex/physiology; Reward; Young Adult,,Wellcome Trust (091593) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT080540MA) United Kingdom; Wellcome Trust (WT088312AIA) United Kingdom,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24941453 https://core.ac.uk/display/21617888 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914004820 https://www.neuroscience.ox.ac.uk/publications/470934 https://www.psych.ox.ac.uk/publications/470934 http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.005 https://www.ohba.ox.ac.uk/publications/470934 https://www.win.ox.ac.uk/publications/470934 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4148525 https://www.ndcn.ox.ac.uk/publications/470934 http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/~lhunt/doc/Neuroimage_2014_Jocham.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/neuroimage/neuroimage100.html#JochamFKKHB14 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1053811914004820 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82756967.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.005,24941453,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2014.06.005,2111199826,PMC4148525,0,000-125-181-498-310; 000-714-989-693-755; 000-777-066-209-45X; 002-034-769-416-645; 003-360-647-916-975; 003-751-199-730-63X; 005-071-894-029-267; 005-107-894-544-949; 005-239-475-084-524; 007-628-273-312-164; 008-234-676-099-93X; 009-916-551-504-713; 011-001-774-847-250; 012-400-952-464-418; 013-263-692-676-956; 015-651-960-297-651; 017-021-927-459-416; 022-626-586-458-273; 026-380-955-565-508; 028-119-339-078-03X; 029-740-999-181-261; 031-136-752-436-374; 032-069-237-980-382; 032-157-818-433-440; 032-623-747-441-94X; 034-899-177-618-554; 037-265-949-465-370; 037-633-350-868-583; 040-349-498-144-08X; 041-099-230-951-726; 041-666-868-277-636; 042-188-357-093-758; 045-016-567-393-917; 048-168-795-320-658; 048-695-086-651-184; 049-771-326-286-189; 052-185-220-519-876; 055-089-853-718-92X; 058-276-964-132-326; 066-050-762-172-74X; 071-021-905-834-455; 088-223-075-692-664; 093-364-634-409-387; 093-498-079-012-711; 096-982-792-680-946; 104-463-562-501-299; 104-699-459-416-951; 104-898-249-163-45X; 108-207-966-869-367; 110-856-463-860-83X; 113-261-426-919-544; 120-990-900-682-649; 140-201-106-613-540; 141-064-197-962-41X; 156-398-161-708-625; 168-156-108-468-865; 168-447-421-152-664; 189-575-029-235-199,32
110-642-930-710-491,De comparatieve beoordelingsmethode voor een betrouwbare en valide cv-screening : Een vergelijking tussen experts en studenten,,2019,journal article,Gedrag & Organisatie,09215077,,,Anneleen Mortier; Renske Brouwer; Liesje Coertjens; Ellen Volckaert; Amelie Vrijdags; Roos Van Gasse; Peter Vlerick; Sven De Maeyer,"ENGLISH: In practice and in earlier empirical research, it is indicated that resume screening does not always provide suitable candidates for a vacancy. This might be due to several issues: one assessor carries out the screening, resulting in cognitive distortions influencing the selection process; the assessment does not focus on all aspects of the selection, nor does it allow for certain criteria to weigh more heavily than others; and/or the assessor is insufficiently trained to carry out the resume screening. The current study captures these issues by offering an alternative assessment method (Comparative Judgment) in which the interrater reliability and construct validity of the resume screening is studied: several assessors with different levels of expertise assess resumes comparatively. In this study, resumes from 42 candidates applying for an existing vacancy were used. These resumes were directly compared by experienced (N = 7; experts), and less experienced assessors (N = 57; students). Results show that the comparative judgements of experienced assessors are linked to valid and reliable resume screening. The inter-rater reliability of the student assessments was lower than that of the experts. Even though the final rank ordering of the resumes correlated, students often relied on irrelevant aspects in the resumes. NEDERLANDS: In de praktijk en uit eerder empirisch onderzoek blijkt dat cv-screening niet altijd zorgt voor geschikte kandidaten voor een vacature. Verschillende zaken kunnen hiervan de oorzaak zijn: een beoordelaar voert de screening uit, waardoor cognitieve vertekeningen het selectieproces kunnen beinvloeden; de beoordeling focust niet op alle relevante aspecten van de selectie of laat bepaalde criteria harder doorwegen dan andere; en/of de beoordelaar heeft onvoldoende expertise om de cv-screening uit te voeren. De huidige studie komt aan deze tekortkomingen tegemoet door de alternatieve beoordelingsmethode, comparatieve vergelijking, te beschrijven en de interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid en constructvaliditeit ervan voor cv-screening na te gaan. In deze studie is gebruikgemaakt van een bestaande vacature waarvoor 42 kandidaten hun cv hebben ingestuurd. Deze cv's zijn comparatief met elkaar vergeleken door ervaren (experts; N = 7) en minder ervaren beoordelaars (studenten; N = 57). De resultaten tonen aan dat comparatieve oordelen van ervaren beoordelaars samenhangen met een valide en betrouwbare cv-screening. De interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid van de oordelen van de studenten was lager dan de interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid van de oordelen van de experts. Hoewel er een sterke correlatie was tussen de rangorde van de ervaren beoordelaars en de rangorde van de studenten, lieten de studenten hun oordeel vaker afhangen van irrelevante aspecten.",32,2,86,107,Humanities; Psychology,,,,,https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/de-comparatieve-beoordelingsmethode-voor-een-betrouwbare-en-valid https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F8eac2675-955e-444b-bc1d-aa5fed575fc1 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:217349 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8628900 https://www.gedragenorganisatie.nl/inhoud/tijdschrift_artikel/GO-32-2-2/De-comparatieve-beoordelingsmethode-voor-een-betrouwbare-en-valide-cv-screening-een-vergelijking-tussen-experts-en-studenten https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8628900/file/8628906.pdf https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/comparative-judgment-as-a-reliable-and-valid-assessment-method-in,https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/de-comparatieve-beoordelingsmethode-voor-een-betrouwbare-en-valid,,,2949831437,,0,,0

111-565-123-172-869,A New Method to Retrieve the Data Requirements of the Remote Sensing Community – Exemplarily Demonstrated for Hyperspectral User NEEDS,2007-08-17,2007,journal article,Sensors,14248220; 14243210,MDPI AG,Switzerland,Jens Nieke; Ils Reusen,"User-driven requirements for remote sensing data are difficult to define, especially details on geometric, spectral and radiometric parameters. Even more difficult is a decent assessment of the required degrees of processing and corresponding data quality. It is therefore a real challenge to appropriately assess data costs and services to be provided. In 2006, the HYRESSA project was initiated within the framework 6 programme of the European Commission to analyze the user needs of the hyperspectral remote sensing community. Special focus was given to finding an answer to the key question, “What are the individual user requirements for hyperspectral imagery and its related data products?”. A Value-Benefit Analysis (VBA) was performed to retrieve user needs and address open items accordingly. The VBA is an established tool for systematic problem solving by supporting the possibility of comparing competing projects or solutions. It enables evaluation on the basis of a multidimensional objective model and can be augmented with expert's preferences. After undergoing a VBA, the scaling method (e.g., Law of Comparative Judgment) was applied for achieving the desired ranking judgments. The result, which is the relative value of projects with respect to a well-defined main objective, can therefore be produced analytically using a VBA. A multidimensional objective model adhering to VBA methodology was established. Thereafter, end users and experts were requested to fill out a Questionnaire of User Needs (QUN) at the highest level of detail - the value indicator level. The end user was additionally requested to report personal preferences for his particular research field. In the end, results from the experts' evaluation and results from a sensor data survey can be compared in order to understand user needs and the drawbacks of existing data products. The investigation – focusing on the needs of the hyperspectral user community in Europe – showed that a VBA is a suitable method for analyzing the needs of hyperspectral data users and supporting the sensor/data specification-building process. The VBA has the advantage of being easy to handle, resulting in a comprehensive evaluation. The primary disadvantage is the large effort in realizing such an analysis because the level of detail is extremely high.",7,8,1545,1558,Visual Basic for Applications; User requirements document; Hyperspectral imaging; Law of comparative judgment; Ranking; Data quality; Computer science; Level of detail; Remote sensing; End user,,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3814868 http://core.ac.uk/display/11290835 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3814868/ https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/7/8/1545 https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/7/8/1545/pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/62444/,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/s7081545,,10.3390/s7081545,1980863734,,0,010-766-935-758-688; 013-015-796-213-451; 021-163-757-946-69X; 033-186-929-439-924; 050-065-623-526-174; 059-196-510-003-438; 068-937-224-502-465; 164-932-845-715-479; 180-674-525-295-39X,8

The results, in terms of scaled subjective differences, are well described by Hellstrom’s (1979) sensation-weighting model. With successive presentation, in comparisons of line length and tone loudness, the first stimulus had the greater weight in determining the subjective difference for short ISIs, the second for longer ISIs.

The glue between confirmation and truth approximation appears to be the instrumentalist methodology, rather than the falsificationist one.; By evaluating theories separately and comparatively in terms of their successes and; problems (hence even if they are already falsified), the instrumentalist methodology provides - both in theory and in practice - the straight route for short-term empirical progress in science in the spirit of Laudan. However, it is argued that such progress is also functional for all kinds of truth approximation: observational, referential, and theoretical. This sheds new light on the long-term dynamic of science and hence on the relation between the main epistemological positions, viz., instrumentalism (Toulmin, Laudan), constructive empiricism (van Fraassen), referential realism (Hacking and Cartwright), and theory realism of a nonessentialist nature (Popper), here called constructive realism.; In From Instrumentalism to Constructive Realism (2000) the above story is presented in great detail. The present synopsis highlights the main ways of theory evaluation presented in that book, viz. evaluation in terms of confirmation (or falsification), empirical progress and truth approximation.",110,439,774,777,Epistemology; Philosophy; Constructive realism; Instrumentalism,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/110/439/774/945747 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12941579.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/110.439.774,,10.1093/mind/110.439.774,1993741687,,0,,0

We propose that evaluators judge those with improved records to be more deserving of future opportunities (e.g., a promotion) and that this can be explained – at least in part – by perceptions of effort investments. Specifically, evaluators rely on improvement to judge effort and hence devalue consistent strong performance. Five studies supported these propositions. Evaluators perceived greater effort investment and trait effort in individuals with improved profiles than those with consistent profiles and consequently thought that those with improved profiles were more deserving of future opportunities. We discuss implications of these results across various decision contexts.

Pohl,"The fast-and-frugal recognition heuristic (RH) theory provides a precise process description of comparative judgments. It claims that, in suitable domains, judgments between pairs of objects are based on recognition alone, whereas further knowledge is ignored. However, due to the confound between recognition and further knowledge, previous research lacked an unbiased measure of RH use. Also, model comparisons have not been based on goodness-of-fit and model complexity as criteria. To overcome both limitations we introduce and test a multinomial processing tree model showing that it fits empirical data and provides an unbiased measure of RH use. Analyses of 8 data sets reveal that the RH alone cannot account for the data, not even when it is implemented in a probabilistic way. That is, information integration beyond recognition plays a vital role and cannot merely account for empirical data better due to model flexibility. Also, we present several validations of the central model parameter and provide demonstrations of how the model can be applied to study the less-is-more effect as well as determinants of (and individual differences in) RH use.

Photographers usually know how to create, with certain artistic sense or taste, depth impression in the process of flattening objects in a three-dimensional space. To emphasis the feeling of depth, photographers tend to choose black and white processing. This is because there has been a myth: color photography is flatter than black and white. From the era of early color photography, pleasure of flatness has been pursued rather than feeling of depth(Newhall, 1982). The aperture and focal length of lenses are the major factors in changing depth impression(London et al, 2002). Depth impression increases when the aperture size is enlarged, resulting in shallower depth of field. When the focal length of lens becomes longer making the discrepancy of relative size among subjects smaller, depth impression decreases (Shin, 2002). This study is performed to investigate the effects of the presence of color as a photographic technique on depth perception. Black and white process is still common in the field of photography as fine art. From the results of this work, the relatively intense feeling of depth can be one of the reasons for that. Figure 1: The effect of aperture on depth perception. Method Fifty (N=50) Yonsei University undergraduates and graduate students were assigned two experiments. The stimuli were taken in color using two techniques: (a) aperture; f/2.8, f/5.6, f/11, f/22, and (b) focal length of lens; 28 mm , 50 mm , 70 mm , 105 mm , which were then duplicated and transformed to gray scale images. The conditions were consistently maintained to reveal the effects of the specific techniques. Every photograph included two same-sized mannequins positioned at different distances from camera. Participants were asked to compare two photographs at a glance, and were forced to identify the photograph in which the two mannequins appear to be closer to each other. This work was supported by Korea Research Foundation Grant (KRF-2002-074-HS1003). Results and Discussion References The frequency was analyzed by the method of paired comparison(Thurstone1927a; 1927b). In the results(Figure 1, 2), the smaller aperture size and the longer focal length decreased depth perception in both chromatic and achromatic images. Color severely decreased depth impression at variations of focal length. In the mean time, the flattening effect of color was relatively weak along aperture variations. This implies that spatial frequency is a strong factor in giving a feeling of depth even in color photographs. London, B. et al.. (2002). Photography, 7th ed. NJ: Pearson Education Inc.. Newhall B.

Montag,"The method of paired comparison is often used in experiments where perceptual scale values for a collection of stimuli are desired, such as in experiments analyzing image quality. Thurstone's Case V of his Law of Comparative Judgments is often used as the basis for analyzing data produced in paired comparison experiments. However, methods for determining confidence intervals and critical distances for significant differences based on Thurstone's Law have been elusive leading some to abandon the simple analysis provided by Thurstone's formulation. In order to provide insight into this problem of determining error, Monte Carlo simulations of paired comparison experiments were performed based on the assumptions of uniformly normal, independent, and uncorrelated responses from stimulus pair presentations. The results from these multiple simulations show that the variation in the distribution of experimental results of paired comparison experiments can be well predicted as a function of stimulus number and the number of observations. Using these results, confidence intervals and critical values for comparisons can be made using traditional statistical methods. In addition the results from simulations can be used to analyze goodness-of-fit techniques.",5294,,222,230,Statistics; Psychophysics; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Monte Carlo method; Paired comparison; Computer science; Confidence interval; Computer simulation; Image quality,,,,,https://proceedings.spiedigitallibrary.org/proceeding.aspx?articleid=836998 https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/5294/1/Louis-Leon-Thurstone-in-Monte-Carlo--creating-error-bars/10.1117/12.526215.full https://www.cis.rit.edu/people/faculty/montag/PDFs/Montag2004SPIE5294.pdf http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003SPIE.5294..222M/abstract https://digitalarchive.rit.edu/xmlui/handle/1850/4328 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ethan_Montag/publication/228852461_Louis_Leon_Thurstone_in_Monte_Carlo_creating_error_bars_for_the_method_of_paired_comparison/links/0c96052b2f21e600bb000000.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.526215,,10.1117/12.526215,2141549332,,0,035-776-610-863-582; 063-314-964-834-008; 065-906-991-595-286; 113-278-954-446-219; 125-506-752-898-572; 198-754-631-432-902,15

114-833-564-450-569,Comparative Judgment-based feedback versus the traditional approach: similarities and differences,,2016,,,,,,Anneleen Mortier; Marije Lesterhuis; Peter Vlerick; Sven De Maeyer,"Traditionally, assessing and feedbacking students’ tasks are mostly done one task at a time (= classic method). This method allows educators to give comments in the text (= classic feedback). However, given the rise of an alternative assessment method (Comparative Judgement - CJ), in which two tasks are compared with each other, the question arises if this method is perceived as easy to provide feedback. Additionally, comparing this method to the classic method, the question also arises how CJ-based feedback differs from the classic method in content. Therefore, this study tried to fill this gap, studying both assessment methods, using quantitative and qualitative measures. CJ is an assessment method where multiple assessors compare two tasks and decide each time which of those two demonstrates the best performance of the given competence (Pollitt, 2012). These tasks are ranked on a scale relatively to each other from worst to best performance (Bramley, 2007). Previous research demonstrates superior reliability and validity over the classic method (Lesterhuis et al., 2015; Pollitt, 2012). Also, CJ-based feedback is perceived as reliable, honest and relevant (Mortier, Lesterhuis, Vlerick, & De Maeyer, 2015). Nevertheless, this feedback has not been investigated in relation to alternative assessment methods. Given this, our study investigated the following research questions:; 1. Does CJ-based assessment lends itself more to give feedback to assessees, according to assessors, in comparison to the classic assessment method?; 2. How is the content of CJ-based feedback different from classic generated feedback?; ; Method; Eleven second year students (= assessors) in the Dutch teacher training program graded and feedbacked letters from 12 first year students in the Dutch teacher training program. Assessors feedbacked the letters in the classic way. Additionally, using CJ, they rated the letters and gave feedback expressed as ‘what is good about this letter’ and ‘what needs to be improved’. The assessment order was contra-balanced. Next, they filled out a survey and participated in focus groups.; 8 Developing assessment policy and practice 14.00-15.00 Rolls; ; Results; Results indicated that the CJ-method is perceived as more difficult to give feedback in comparison to the classic method (M=3.5, SD=0.9). Focus groups revealed that assessors in the CJ-condition did not go into micro-detail. However, they appreciated the positive approach in CJ, forcing them to also give positive comments, which they were not inclined to do in the classic method. This was also confirmed by content analysis: (?²(1, N = 4) = 113.91, p<.001, Cramer’s V=.45). Additionally, further analyses revealed that CJ-based feedback was more focused on style, structure and lay-out , while the classic feedback was more focused on spelling, punctuation, and phrasing ((?² (1, N = 13) = 138.23 , p < .001, effect size: Cramer’ V= .48)).; ; Conclusion; This study suggests that the CJ assessment method, in comparison with a traditional assessment method, is perceived by assessors as less easy to provide feedback.

The results showed that these effects were similar for both minority and White students. Membership in ethnic student organizations for minorities and Greek organizations for Whites was anteceded by the degree of one's ethnic identity, and the effects of membership in these groups were similar, although not identical, for both White and minority students. These effects included an increased sense of ethnic victimization and a decreased sense of common identity and social inclusiveness. Consistent with social identity theory, at least a portion of these effects were mediated by social identity among both White and minority students.",87,1,96,110,Social environment; Social relation; Ethnic group; Racism; Sociology; Social group; Personality; Social organization; Social psychology; Social identity theory,,"Adult; Cluster Analysis; Conflict, Psychological; Crime Victims; Ethnic Groups; Female; Group Processes; Humans; Male; Self Concept; Social Identification; Surveys and Questionnaires; Universities",,,https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/3205411 https://core.ac.uk/display/101956480 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-15934-007 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15250795 https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3205411/Sidanius_EthnicEnclaves.pdf http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.96 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/34626651.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.96,15250795,10.1037/0022-3514.87.1.96,2077318189,,0,004-613-211-004-392; 006-955-004-933-28X; 010-925-057-438-386; 010-948-752-350-839; 012-158-283-948-323; 015-064-449-133-645; 015-121-644-591-252; 015-298-485-240-781; 016-231-166-302-471; 017-937-382-960-322; 024-477-164-634-819; 025-264-696-722-550; 026-646-981-568-070; 026-656-397-485-494; 027-359-718-261-308; 035-382-516-659-129; 035-415-296-676-08X; 035-839-307-977-910; 045-880-085-089-56X; 049-129-604-803-345; 056-888-105-032-700; 060-169-663-665-557; 061-613-948-932-684; 065-464-957-757-100; 070-282-649-229-844; 071-272-947-290-085; 073-161-602-223-291; 074-489-223-965-135; 076-218-832-721-935; 080-432-271-897-595; 081-513-678-718-748; 083-156-262-954-413; 091-180-159-448-483; 092-379-280-270-300; 095-170-692-127-246; 099-202-440-713-31X; 100-693-528-987-182; 100-916-747-829-411; 102-625-433-405-15X; 109-712-735-940-385; 126-086-062-012-461; 134-519-515-066-528; 142-175-619-414-56X; 142-472-047-194-290; 147-775-926-654-839; 149-578-054-880-002; 157-135-411-518-771; 161-472-478-836-389; 165-456-350-390-918; 171-788-449-826-652; 179-841-413-058-250; 179-963-740-591-189; 194-422-717-962-369,151

115-292-228-055-380,FUSION - Image fusion for human observers: How should we choose the method?,,2010,conference proceedings,2010 13th International Conference on Information Fusion,,IEEE,,Murray Loew; James Bonick; Clarence P. Walters,"Image fusion is used to improve target detection and identification. In human-observer applications it is useful to rank fusion methods according to how well they assist the observer in a decision task. Two images (medium- and long-wave infrared), acquired for each of a number of outdoor scenes, were fused by each of nine methods. For each scene, a set of observers assessed each of the 36 pairwise combinations of fused images, choosing from each pair the one that was deemed best for target identification. We used that set of preferences to rank the fusion methods for their effectiveness in the identification task. A classical technique for ranking these “discriminal processes” is Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgment and its implementation as the Thurstone-Mosteller (TM) Method of Paired Comparisons, which is reviewed briefly here. To make meaningful statements about preferences, one should have a measure of uncertainty for each rank. The TM method, however, cannot readily provide such a measure. An alternative, the Bradley-Terry (BT) method, does permit calculation of confidence intervals for ranks. To our knowledge, BT has not previously been applied in the evaluation of fusion methods. We present results from a multi-observer, multi-view trial, evaluated using TM and BT. The methods yield similar rankings of the fusion methods. But the additional information provided by BT — that is, whether there are significant differences between the ranks — can have a substantial impact on the implementation of fusion in real systems. There could be meaningful tradeoffs among fusion methods — e.g., performance vs. computation time — that may not be exploited in the absence of those insights.",,,1,8,Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Law of comparative judgment; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Object detection; Night vision; Computer vision; Sensor fusion; Computer science; Image fusion,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/fusion/fusion2010.html#LoewBW10 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/5711838/ http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000005711838,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/icif.2010.5711838,,10.1109/icif.2010.5711838,2045592039,,0,011-105-391-999-886; 016-102-034-584-357; 018-269-445-638-29X; 023-707-591-457-591; 028-422-206-398-04X; 037-094-759-392-621; 038-006-952-581-444; 038-572-130-239-101; 038-688-009-271-980; 065-820-530-356-445; 065-906-991-595-286; 068-885-458-943-499; 098-173-496-566-324; 113-278-954-446-219; 117-352-939-718-472; 117-525-565-120-347,0

This contribution wants to fill this void by investigating;                     the overall perceived speech quality of both groups. Three groups of listeners (speech and language pathologists, primary school;                     teachers and inexperienced listeners) judged 126 utterances of seven normally hearing children, seven children with an acoustic;                     hearing aid and seven children with a cochlear implant, in a comparative judgment task.

Within the group of hearing-impaired children, cochlear implanted children were judged to exhibit;                     higher speech quality than acoustically hearing aided children, especially after a longer device use.

Moreover, in the presence of airflow and by increasing its speed, due to the forced convective heat loss, the outer surface temperature of the mittens decreases and therefore the conductive heat transfer rate rises. This fact leads to the transfer of higher quantity of body warmth to the environment and thus feeling of coldness. According to the results, there was a proper correlation between the subjective perception of cold and the heat transfer rate of mittens. The statistical analysis of the results clarified that the effect of mitten's structural parameters and the airflow speed on the thermal protection behavior of mittens are significant at the confidence range of 95%.</jats:p></jats:sec><jats:sec><jats:title content-type=""abstract-subheading"">Originality/value</jats:title><jats:p>Mitten is one of the important personal protective clothing, especially in cold environments.

However, the display characteristics are also essential for the overall Quality of Experience (QoE). In this paper, we use a model of a backlight dimming system for Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) and show how the modeled image can be used as an input to quality assessment algorithms. For quality assessment, we propose an image quality metric, based on Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) computation in the CIE L*a*b* color space. The metric takes luminance reduction, color distortion and loss of uniformity in the resulting image in consideration. Subjective evaluations of images generated using different backlight dimming algorithms and clipping strategies show that the proposed metric estimates the perceived image quality more accurately than conventional PSNR.",,,1,6,Video quality; Distortion; Liquid-crystal display; Color image; Artificial intelligence; Backlight; Color space; Computer vision; Computer science; Image quality; Luminance,,,,,https://orbit.dtu.dk/files/78941973/prod11387278697942.598_CR_20130816180023.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/vcip/vcip2013.html#KorhonenMBF13 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/19182787.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/vcip.2013.6706383,,10.1109/vcip.2013.6706383,2030748437,,0,000-769-994-833-730; 004-903-424-839-516; 005-506-010-676-849; 024-790-159-505-327; 034-074-319-955-729; 035-200-642-657-589; 037-094-759-392-621; 079-601-550-056-691; 085-987-862-481-381; 093-165-200-816-549; 130-937-902-428-29X; 137-062-990-798-842; 146-529-520-555-670; 151-758-314-458-108,5

According to the local-comparisons-general-standards (LOGE) approach, in these member-to-group comparisons, people fail to use the normatively appropriate local (group) standard and are infelicitously affected by a more general standard (involving instances from outside the judged group). Within positive groups, target group members are judged superior to the other members of the group, and within negative groups, inferior. To date, these nonselective superiority and inferiority biases have been demonstrated solely in judgments about human beings.

Color impressions are the basic concept known as psychological effects of colors. In this paper two pieces of subjective information are considered in order to construct the subjective model. One is the information of the absolute relationship between a color and the subjective degree of its impressions. And the other is the one about the relative relationship between colors on a subjective measure in terms of color impressions. Two kinds of questionnaires, called the absolute and the comparative judgments, are performed to get the subjective information. Additionally, this paper proposes improves the method so that is more applicable to the practical use.

The conventional MCDA approach assumes the spatial homogeneity of alternatives within the case study area, although it is often unrealistic. On the other side, GIS provides excellent data acquisition, storage, manipulation and analysis capabilities, but in the case of a value structure analysis this capability is lower. For these reasons, several studies in the last twenty years have given attention to MCDA-GIS integration and to the development of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS). Hitherto, most of these applications are based only on a formal integration between the two approaches. In this paper, we propose a complete MCDA-GIS integration with a plurality of MCDA methodologies, grouped in a suite. More precisely, we considered an open-source GIS (GRASS GIS 6.4) and a modular package including five MCDA modules based on five different methodologies. The methods included are: ELECTRE I, Fuzzy set, REGIME analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. Thanks to the modular nature of the package, it is possible to add new methods without modifying the existing structure. To present the suite, we applied each module to the same case study, making comparisons. The strong points of the MCDA-GIS integration we developed are its open-source setting and the user friendly interface, both thanks to GRASS GIS, and the use of raster data. Moreover, our suite is a genuine case of perfect integration, where the spatial nature of criteria is always present.",146,,491,504,Decision support system; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Engineering; Industrial engineering; AM/FM/GIS; Decision analysis; Operations management; Geographic information system; ELECTRE; Enterprise GIS; Analytic hierarchy process,GIS; GIS-MCDA integration; Modular package; Multicriteria analysis; Spatial Decision Support Systems,Agriculture/methods; Decision Support Techniques; Geographic Information Systems; Italy; Software; Soil/chemistry; Waste Water/chemistry,Soil; Waste Water,,https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/decision-support-systems-for-environmental-management(a4afec09-c721-4344-aa1e-495a2c121635).html https://core.ac.uk/display/44337503 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/3587797/GRECO_2014_cright_JEM_Decision_Support_Systems_for_environmental_management.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217251 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479714004150 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/96911444.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.08.012,25217251,10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.08.012,2088390482,,0,000-032-310-152-613; 000-049-774-109-155; 005-028-004-000-718; 007-829-009-877-044; 009-520-084-489-639; 009-731-056-359-941; 009-881-393-198-900; 013-558-194-366-638; 016-222-156-789-082; 019-450-646-323-721; 019-896-301-668-915; 023-717-798-956-450; 027-658-098-723-734; 031-168-518-307-415; 037-505-789-176-616; 039-081-048-503-970; 039-970-993-010-206; 043-941-724-908-466; 044-275-299-608-263; 044-388-174-583-067; 050-435-190-329-575; 051-701-541-652-944; 051-764-724-269-647; 054-042-325-761-209; 054-297-454-062-396; 056-525-608-995-872; 057-873-249-802-836; 057-899-470-719-009; 059-621-625-774-632; 060-294-104-085-524; 062-866-939-598-807; 064-271-728-969-663; 070-518-134-439-20X; 071-274-427-367-121; 073-918-970-797-792; 074-752-562-443-142; 076-397-023-710-589; 077-924-178-869-437; 079-925-407-613-097; 084-244-646-766-522; 087-005-168-992-082; 088-082-540-347-879; 090-743-207-313-533; 092-518-232-011-23X; 094-881-485-482-901; 094-916-258-044-36X; 096-232-935-502-942; 096-556-213-149-623; 102-945-489-185-769; 103-295-534-710-003; 110-401-992-531-715; 113-968-021-053-614; 119-735-713-316-500; 121-543-799-545-35X; 124-821-847-488-721; 125-207-679-674-272; 127-655-403-797-492; 127-899-183-292-505; 130-033-583-833-869; 136-856-541-162-580; 144-081-647-582-70X; 153-020-497-021-110; 153-544-055-666-12X; 159-616-324-894-197; 169-201-939-642-576; 170-098-095-607-115; 189-948-451-028-944; 193-576-286-556-777,42

However, in order to use these ordinal methods to produce health state values for use in cost-effectiveness analysis using cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) analysis, these values must be anchored on the full health-dead scale. The paper reports on two feasibility studies that use two approaches to anchor health state utility values derived from discrete choice data on the full health-dead scale: normalising using (1) the TTO value of the worst state and (2) the coefficient on the ‘dead’ dummy variable. Health state utility values obtained using rank and discrete choice data are compared to more commonly used TTO utility values for two condition-specific preference-based measures; asthma and overactive bladder. Ordinal methods were found to offer a promising alternative to conventional cardinal methods of standard gamble and TTO.

Based on this innovation goal through its unit for New Technologies in Education (NTE) the University adopted in 2003 a pilot-project to develop pedagogical contents for Learning Management System (LMS). The main idea was to complement face-to-face classes with a online teaching/learning component in this paper the online courses should intended a blended-learning support for presential courses. The most important and more common pedagogical support gave by the office to those teachers interested in blended-learning methodology are the personal work meetings with them, usually followed by presentations of the platform to the students on their first presential class. After a few years with more than 774 online courses the NTE office, composed of a multidisciplinary team of eight persons, gives not only technical and pedagogical support to the academic community that is using the institutional e-learning platform – Moodle U.PORTO – but also makes available other services, encourages and supports their use. Despite all the obstacles inherent in the implementation of a Computer-Based Assessment (CBA) strategy in a traditional and large university like U.Porto, the office is engaged in supporting eassessment. Although the online assessments that have been taking place are individual experiences, they are of major importance since they allow the identification of problems and definition of the necessary improvements. All the online assessments have been performed in Moodle. Aware of the importance of e-contents as a way to enhance students’ knowledge the office provides a service of educational multimedia objects development for teachers that have online courses. The objects are developed by a small sub-team and the most common types of multimedia contents requested are videos sessions, animations, graphic works, and some simulations. A free of charge videoconference studio and a telepresence room, both managed by NTE, are also available to the academic community. The persons from the office who are responsible for those infrastructures also provide technical support for Educast – software for web broadcast – and Colibri – software that allows web conference. In the last few years the office have presented and is trying motivate more discussion on pedagogical issues like digital accessibility or the viability of e-portfolios as an instrument to meet the changing needs of teaching and learning. So to improve the knowledge and performance of teachers and students in ICT issues – and therefore promote the NTE services described above – the office has conducted continuing education courses, workshops and small events some of them with guest speakers experts in areas such as comparative judgment assessment, e-assessment or electronic portfolios. The feedback obtained over the years has shown that the existence of an office that works so closely to the academic community facilitates not only the implementation of projects like these but also allows create foundations for more innovation.",,,5627,5636,Dissemination; Emerging technologies; Videoconferencing; Software; Learning Management; Technical support; Computer science; Studio; Knowledge management; Information and Communications Technology,,,,,https://library.iated.org/view/CORREIA2011NEW https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/bitstream/10216/56961/2/88607.pdf https://repositorio-aberto.up.pt/handle/10216/56961,https://library.iated.org/view/CORREIA2011NEW,,,1558522187,,0,012-818-016-545-862; 055-948-326-075-646; 071-857-161-707-188; 097-629-037-694-26X,0

However, it is still not clear whether or not the finding generalizes to other kinds of visual stimuli, because there are more appropriate visual stimuli for exploration of depth perception of luminance-contrast changes, such as Gabor patch. Here, we further examined the relationship between image resolution and depth perception by conducting a series of psychophysical experiments with not only Cylinders but also Gabor patches having smoother luminance-contrast gradients. As a result, higher resolution images produced stronger depth sensation with both images. This finding suggests that image resolution affects depth perception of simple luminance-contrast differences (Gabor patch) as well as shape-from-shading (Cylinder). In addition, this phenomenon was found even when the resolution difference was undetectable. This indicates the existence of consciously available and unavailable information in our visual system. These findings further support the view that image resolution is a cue for depth perception that was previously ignored. It partially explains the unparalleled viewing experience of novel high resolution displays.",7,,242,242,Aerial perspective; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Autostereogram; Visual perception; Image resolution; Computer vision; Kinetic depth effect; Depth perception; Display resolution; Binocular disparity,conscious/unconscious; depth perception; depth sensation; display resolution; shading,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4763190 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00242/abstract http://search.bvsalud.org/portal/resource/en/mdl-26941693 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00242/full https://core.ac.uk/display/43816771 https://doaj.org/article/fb95c688560b4e12bc85f77b96858246 https://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00242 https://philpapers.org/rec/TSUUCI https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82843972.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00242,26941693,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00242,2290170439,PMC4763190,0,000-352-561-813-570; 001-788-920-274-884; 007-349-287-497-452; 009-008-587-902-955; 015-730-462-360-529; 022-639-993-649-029; 034-122-006-668-503; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-526-757-847-526; 037-094-759-392-621; 040-888-576-377-085; 043-864-404-612-598; 047-439-330-277-288; 048-489-987-727-978; 055-469-431-572-902; 058-515-516-320-724; 059-616-850-772-709; 064-425-045-760-069; 068-939-777-030-989; 070-544-130-347-008; 074-658-473-558-780; 092-850-017-631-81X; 102-555-702-781-751; 107-396-217-488-486; 112-187-643-072-379; 117-352-939-718-472; 121-161-560-636-803,7

The study group includes 174 education supervisors who are on duty in the primary school section of 56 different provinces. “Evaluation Form of Education Supervisors’ Mission Priorities” has been used as the data collection tool. Evaluation form of education supervisors’ mission priorities were scaled from complete data matrix with Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment case V. Equation. After the scaling operation, the inner consistency of supervisor judgments, the extent of agreement among supervisors and the significance of these were examined. For this process, two statistics called Kendall’s zeta statistics and Kendall’s U statistics were used. The results of this study have revealed that “counseling and in service training” is considered as a primary mission by education supervisors. Guidance and on site training is followed by “inspection and evaluation”, “research”, and lastly “inquisition”. In addition, the education supervisor can be considered as consistent in her/his judgment and the education supervisors’ judgments are considered in agreement.

This study set out compare their effects on self-evaluations, decisions under uncertainty, performance attribution, and perceived relevance of the task to one's self-concept. 415 participants were told they had gotten 20% correct, 80% correct, or were not given then their scores on a practice test. Orthogonal to this manipulation, participants learned that their performance placed them in the 23rd percentile or 77th percentile, or they did not receive comparative feedback. They were then given a chance to place bets on two games - one in which they needed to get more than 50% right (absolute bet), and one in which they needed to beat more than 50% of other test-takers (comparative bet). Absolute feedback had strong and consistent influences on participants' bets, performance attributions, perceived task importance, satisfaction with performance, and state self-esteem. The effects of comparative feedback were weaker and less consistent.

119-944-719-393-049,Adaptive comparative judgement: Adapting adaptive assessment to assess the quality of students’ work,,2012,,,,,,Alastair Pollitt; Matt Wingfield,"It is increasingly acknowledged that adaptive assessment has a significant role to play in enhancing the assessment of and for learning. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a familiar method of delivering adaptive assessment, but it comes with a number of challenges that make it difficult to deploy, especially its reliance on questions (items) that can be presented and scored on computer, as well as the need for a large bank of items that have all been calibrated on large samples of suitable students. This paper focuses on a new form of adaptive assessment, where the adaptive nature of the approach is the very thing that makes it viable for large scale deployment. Adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ) is based on a historically sound approach developed by L.L. Thurstone in 1927 - the law of comparative judgement. The approach utilises paired comparisons to deliver highly reliable, non-subjective scaled ranking, but in its raw state, it relies on many paired comparisons to achieve a secure ranked result, making it impractical for use as an operational system. Through work carried out over several years, TAG Developments, working with Cambridge expert Alastair Pollitt, has developed a web-based application of Thurstone's law that is underpinned by an innovative adaptive algorithm which can generate a secure, scaled rank order of student work at least as efficiently as traditional marking. In addition, since assessors are not restricted to the types of task that can be marked reliably, they are free to use whatever methods they judge most authentic and valid. The system therefore delivers strong validity and exceptional reliability when compared to traditional criterion referenced assessment methods. In addition to outlining ACJ and its advantages and disadvantages, the paper also provides information on a number of research projects and live/pilot deployments where the approach has been used in an assessment context.",2,2,,,Machine learning; Engineering; Computerized adaptive testing; Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Adaptive algorithm; Judgement; Operational system; Criterion-referenced test,,,,,https://ijea.org.uk/index.php/journal/article/view/42,https://ijea.org.uk/index.php/journal/article/view/42,,,2751650050,,0,,0

Sixteen competencies were assessed by peers, bosses and subordinates of 922 managers, as well as self-assessed, using the Inventory of Management Competencies (IMC) administered in two formats – Likert scale and multidimensional forced choice. Likert ratings were subject to strong response biases, making even theoretically unrelated competencies correlate highly. Modeling a latent common method factor, which represented non-uniform distortions similar to those of “ideal-employee” factor in both self- and other assessments, improved validity of competency scores as evidenced by meaningful second-order factor structures, better inter-rater agreement, and better convergent correlations with an external personality measure. Forced-choice rankings modelled with Thurstonian IRT yielded as good construct and convergent validities as the bias-controlled Likert ratings, and slightly better rater agreement. We suggest that the mechanism for these enhancements is finer differentiation between behaviors in comparative judgements, and advocate the operational use of the multidimensional forced-choice response format as an effective bias prevention method.",20,1,121,148,Competence (human resources); Two-alternative forced choice; Likert scale; Psychology; 360-degree feedback; Common method; Personality measurement; Large sample; Social psychology,,,,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/31808 http://orm.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/09/14/1094428116668036.abstract?rss=1 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1094428116668036 http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/811741/ http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1094428116668036 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094428116668036 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/56849/ https://core.ac.uk/display/46164657 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76988003.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1094428116668036,,10.1177/1094428116668036,2518837046,,0,003-424-873-906-097; 003-827-323-981-814; 004-414-436-917-174; 005-125-076-444-435; 005-619-715-572-32X; 005-944-986-860-875; 007-937-422-698-646; 009-554-139-359-758; 010-023-219-291-67X; 011-140-195-981-199; 011-704-099-375-309; 012-533-199-430-099; 012-605-981-755-950; 013-250-533-880-180; 016-334-794-759-191; 017-504-153-087-087; 022-874-450-990-810; 027-914-759-250-461; 032-171-661-043-68X; 033-171-354-077-456; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-231-157-137-528; 043-209-749-101-784; 045-467-194-880-837; 049-031-700-146-909; 050-774-931-252-816; 051-103-693-658-229; 053-683-775-278-605; 054-227-285-251-001; 055-534-572-092-062; 062-084-670-744-560; 063-173-731-251-585; 063-340-335-909-221; 065-130-290-645-468; 072-174-081-549-611; 076-133-783-142-378; 079-646-550-056-48X; 082-429-809-925-881; 084-672-021-220-248; 088-302-026-824-355; 089-142-960-937-363; 095-083-647-703-800; 097-637-615-501-803; 100-923-052-964-831; 102-693-982-590-25X; 104-849-049-483-28X; 105-787-802-380-041; 105-947-811-754-818; 106-812-550-778-018; 108-831-924-899-305; 113-184-123-590-319; 116-953-447-460-185; 129-178-025-132-832; 138-919-832-514-732; 151-999-065-318-418; 152-507-665-090-595; 168-102-460-634-312; 181-363-802-296-381; 185-252-489-419-325,15

When handled with care, feedback has been identified as a key strategy for learning. However, the results of feedback are difficult to foresee.  Criteria  for  success  play  an  important  role  for  feedback,  as  every  pupil  benefit  of  transparency regarding learning intentions and criteria for success.

J. A. Ellis; B. Perrat; J. Goulding,"Finding the deprived areas in any country or city can allow policy makers to design interventions which support citizens in these areas. Locating these areas is often challenging in developing countries where official statistics may not be collected or are unreliable. Comparative judgement models, such as the Bradley--Terry model, offer a solution leveraging local knowledge by comparing different areas based on affluence. Existing comparative judgement methods require a large amount of data to be collected, which can be expensive and time consuming, particularly in developing countries. In this article we develop the Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry model, which substantially decreases the amount of data that needs to be collected. We do this by constructing a network representation of the city and incorporating an assumption of spatial smoothness, meaning we can learn about the level of deprivation in one area from neighbouring areas. We demonstrate our method on a novel comparative judgement data set collected in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where we are able to identify several slums and the level of deprivation of each slum.",,,,,Bayesian probability; Regional science; Official statistics; Geography; Psychological intervention; Judgement; Slum; Tanzania; Bradley–Terry model; Developing country,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14128.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201014128S/abstract http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14128.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128 https://aps.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128,,,3096736113,,0,005-932-334-805-223; 007-730-040-038-468; 009-731-680-573-255; 011-105-391-999-886; 013-056-378-792-578; 014-470-716-101-523; 014-832-499-648-674; 016-178-367-287-757; 018-036-661-212-608; 025-009-658-071-875; 031-947-903-216-926; 032-437-388-057-540; 038-809-435-969-896; 041-656-251-943-572; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-115-902-001-10X; 052-955-411-698-406; 076-720-080-903-106; 079-011-726-795-309; 079-863-114-555-507; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 093-777-263-895-915; 117-309-565-714-034; 120-424-874-837-080; 124-103-129-714-441; 124-850-148-955-311; 168-663-423-050-326; 170-919-478-336-370; 171-083-962-161-997; 175-755-079-554-999,0

Serences,"Although attention is known to improve the efficacy of sensory processing, the impact of attention on subjective visual appearance is still a matter of debate. Although recent studies suggest that attention can alter the appearance of stimulus contrast, others argue that these changes reflect response bias induced by attention cues. Here, we provide evidence that attention has effects on both appearance and response bias. In a comparative judgment task in which subjects reported whether the attended or unattended visual stimulus had a higher perceived contrast, attention induced substantial baseline-offset response bias as well as small but significant changes in subjective contrast appearance when subjects viewed near-threshold stimuli. However, when subjects viewed suprathreshold stimuli, baseline-offset response bias decreased and attention primarily changed contrast appearance. To address the possibility that these changes in appearance might be influenced by uncertainty due to the attended and unattended stimuli having similar physical contrasts, subjects performed an equality judgment task in which they reported if the contrast of the two stimuli was the same or different. We found that, although there were still attention-induced changes in contrast appearance at lower contrasts, the robust changes in contrast appearance at higher contrasts observed in the comparative judgment task were diminished in the equality judgment task. Together, these results suggest that attention can impact both response bias and appearance, and these two types of attention effects are differentially mediated by stimulus visibility and uncertainty. Collectively, these findings help constrain arguments about the cognitive penetrability of perception.",19,14,8,8,Sensation; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Response bias; Visual appearance; Cognition; Perception; Sensory processing; Audiology; Contrast (statistics),,Adolescent; Adult; Attention/physiology; Bias; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Cues; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Photic Stimulation/methods; Sensation; Uncertainty; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult,,NEI NIH HHS (R01 EY025872) United States,https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31826253/ https://jov.arvojournals.org/article.aspx?articleid=2757413 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31826253,http://dx.doi.org/10.1167/19.14.8,31826253,10.1167/19.14.8,2994744375,PMC6908139,0,003-256-412-865-819; 005-364-968-935-588; 005-538-893-370-734; 006-635-819-665-420; 006-890-882-656-98X; 006-974-290-118-596; 009-514-462-990-842; 009-621-330-375-024; 010-087-841-033-008; 010-629-061-233-301; 010-941-661-113-334; 011-601-854-227-368; 014-568-640-265-841; 014-669-165-389-53X; 014-706-694-488-146; 014-893-281-836-583; 014-927-222-317-276; 015-565-968-648-347; 018-644-983-172-951; 018-902-176-159-944; 019-070-518-571-38X; 019-489-634-399-268; 021-131-458-001-390; 021-653-625-766-728; 022-035-864-030-513; 022-908-301-099-074; 029-716-303-639-642; 030-522-082-330-309; 031-324-485-402-628; 031-557-912-484-38X; 031-886-494-015-923; 034-813-736-586-617; 035-526-757-847-526; 035-600-460-328-488; 035-841-298-157-47X; 035-858-014-020-019; 036-209-359-382-759; 038-060-973-467-699; 040-478-760-670-511; 040-844-727-099-250; 042-339-635-956-53X; 044-433-991-525-780; 045-273-988-743-943; 045-355-340-347-429; 046-878-449-672-347; 051-014-966-189-532; 053-769-600-486-40X; 054-581-153-094-317; 055-470-877-444-583; 057-590-452-747-502; 062-850-728-477-515; 063-534-770-531-329; 068-538-601-844-877; 070-536-952-301-13X; 077-223-748-392-772; 080-366-931-407-908; 082-941-024-231-786; 085-951-007-325-666; 089-660-676-048-18X; 093-026-437-292-181; 094-795-066-310-768; 098-257-231-316-678; 108-255-477-299-005; 110-183-437-083-746; 110-188-656-647-911; 110-975-130-163-122; 111-663-181-404-268; 112-951-565-313-763; 114-902-585-779-941; 116-151-330-413-700; 120-859-921-913-350; 121-593-252-566-54X; 123-587-518-864-694; 125-875-745-762-03X; 127-452-127-540-315; 128-260-341-881-33X; 129-385-501-639-215; 163-307-707-970-578; 163-648-236-426-263; 171-293-257-714-862; 176-370-039-035-456; 195-656-865-139-575,1

Gilmore; Matthew Inglis,"An impediment to conducting high-quality quantitative research studies in education is the paucity of valid measures of learning gains. Studies often seek to investigate students’ deep, conceptual understanding yet many measures assess only surface, procedural understanding. One reason is that the development of validated measures of conceptual understanding is; resource intensive, time consuming, and success is not guaranteed. We evaluated a novel and efficient technique, based on comparative judgement, for assessing conceptual understanding. We applied the technique to a randomised controlled trial in which students were taught simple algebra based on either the Grid Algebra or the MiGen software package. The; participants were Year 5 students (N = 188) drawn from four primary schools who had not encountered algebra previously. An instrument from the literature (Concepts in Secondary Mathematics and Science: Algebra Scale), and a novel comparative judgement assessment were administered following the intervention. Students in the Grid Algebra condition outperformed those in the MiGen condition on both post-test measures. The comparative judgement technique performed similarly to the standard instrument but was far more efficient to design and implement. The technique can, in principle, be quickly applied to any target concept of interest. We conclude that comparative judgement is a valid, reliable and practical tool that could help to increase both the quantity and quality of quantitative research in education.",45,3,662,680,Mathematics education; Randomized controlled trial; Grid; Judgement; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Research studies; Computer science; Concept learning; Quantitative research; Teaching method,,,,,https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/berj.3519 https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/2086/17819/1/unblindedBERJv6.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_in_randomised_controlled_trials_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9367286 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1217574 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_in_randomised_controlled_trials_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9367286 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/berj.3519 https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/17819,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/berj.3519,,10.1002/berj.3519,2944732768,,0,000-083-173-604-74X; 004-257-050-498-919; 007-327-090-466-145; 008-352-828-586-786; 009-486-832-701-513; 010-184-721-331-793; 014-392-940-528-758; 016-061-342-436-657; 020-097-247-590-604; 021-386-533-570-898; 022-886-709-886-069; 027-043-806-375-152; 028-600-184-401-058; 029-170-231-544-764; 032-908-431-584-353; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-416-173-942-082; 040-322-708-659-111; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-426-516-197-907; 051-492-788-553-405; 055-622-216-898-182; 057-106-898-116-433; 059-996-900-937-514; 061-928-852-602-804; 069-479-016-271-86X; 074-130-298-330-256; 079-204-990-553-617; 089-893-698-644-668; 089-966-641-745-315; 098-234-435-889-919; 103-589-015-928-645; 104-214-513-904-430; 105-937-076-512-724; 123-212-204-814-685; 168-704-895-296-891; 177-072-688-486-223; 177-646-788-839-209; 182-789-160-159-32X,7

Absolute magnitude, however, is often not informative enough to guide decisions in conflicting social and foraging situations [9, 10] that require an assessment of quantity ratios. We report that rhesus monkeys can discriminate proportions (1:4, 2:4, 3:4, and 4:4) specified by bars differing in lengths and that they can do so at a precision comparable to that shown by humans; the monkeys thus demonstrate an abstract understanding of proportionality. Moreover, neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortex selectively responded to preferred proportions regardless of the exact physical appearance of the stimuli.

Growdon; Matthew P. Frosch; Bradley T. Hyman,"Classical immunohistochemical studies in the Alzheimer disease (AD) brain reveal prominent glial reactions, but whether this pathological feature is due primarily to cell proliferation or to a phenotypic change of existing resting cells remains controversial. We performed double-fluorescence immunohistochemical studies of astrocytes and microglia, followed by unbiased stereology-based quantitation in temporal cortex of 40 AD patients and 32 age-matched nondemented subjects. Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) and major histocompatibility complex II (MHC2) were used as markers of astrocytic and microglial activation, respectively. Aldehyde dehydrogenase 1 L1 and glutamine synthetase were used as constitutive astrocytic markers, and ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1 (IBA1) as a constitutive microglial marker. As expected, AD patients had higher numbers of GFAP+ astrocytes and MHC2+ microglia than the nondemented subjects. However, both groups had similar numbers of total astrocytes and microglia and, in the AD group, these total numbers remained essentially constant over the clinical course of the disease. The GFAP immunoreactivity of astrocytes, but not the MHC2 immunoreactivity of microglia, increased in parallel with the duration of the clinical illness in the AD group. Cortical atrophy contributed to the perception of increased glia density. We conclude that a phenotypic change of existing glial cells, rather than a marked proliferation of glial precursors, accounts for the majority of the glial responses observed in the AD brain.",182,6,2332,2344,Pathology; Immunohistochemistry; Stereology; Glutamine synthetase; Microglia; Glial fibrillary acidic protein; Atrophy; Temporal cortex; Alzheimer's disease; Biology,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Alzheimer Disease/metabolism; Astrocytes/metabolism; Atrophy/pathology; Case-Control Studies; Cell Count; Cell Proliferation; Female; Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein/metabolism; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II/metabolism; Humans; Male; Microglia/metabolism; Microscopy, Confocal; Phenotype; Temporal Lobe/metabolism",Glial Fibrillary Acidic Protein; Histocompatibility Antigens Class II,NIA NIH HHS (P50-AG05134) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P30 AG062421) United States; NIA NIH HHS (R01 AG008487) United States; NIA NIH HHS (P50 AG005134) United States; NIA NIH HHS (AG08487) United States,https://europepmc.org/article/PMC/PMC3668030 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002944013002101 https://core.ac.uk/display/82172491 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23602650 https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.02.031 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82172491.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.02.031,23602650,10.1016/j.ajpath.2013.02.031,2155009321,PMC3668030,0,000-481-546-592-942; 001-065-818-920-350; 002-446-164-023-997; 004-265-713-644-64X; 004-290-094-833-103; 005-964-944-445-68X; 010-527-463-419-62X; 011-054-916-186-312; 011-180-084-964-237; 011-275-645-858-39X; 011-920-060-714-517; 012-190-405-031-59X; 013-736-474-015-313; 015-271-957-610-964; 016-544-325-366-702; 017-927-730-576-10X; 020-395-524-399-150; 021-057-999-742-869; 021-704-111-617-204; 035-350-794-671-885; 036-300-020-674-282; 036-513-011-514-18X; 038-275-419-364-068; 040-935-636-970-083; 041-001-905-763-283; 041-975-309-674-415; 042-470-301-327-059; 044-191-339-632-48X; 045-253-581-407-624; 047-570-536-003-892; 048-536-112-681-339; 049-189-537-734-312; 049-856-796-644-705; 050-442-559-706-488; 051-977-882-734-996; 053-981-484-153-779; 055-444-432-050-507; 056-351-959-024-405; 057-203-964-821-638; 059-046-682-344-075; 063-349-123-806-360; 063-470-271-195-973; 064-083-267-689-651; 067-745-923-759-056; 068-287-413-412-280; 070-122-293-765-407; 073-449-103-404-47X; 077-359-555-316-67X; 079-474-470-391-298; 081-870-620-197-05X; 083-141-144-637-984; 084-185-721-557-580; 085-060-958-223-738; 089-844-899-314-963; 092-888-585-000-948; 094-007-400-831-826; 096-597-560-888-19X; 097-224-008-911-16X; 101-743-487-659-519; 102-150-388-078-930; 107-515-967-272-237; 108-529-057-271-52X; 120-765-761-486-400; 135-448-826-770-302; 141-850-572-581-335; 146-664-701-937-776; 171-545-463-146-446; 191-357-128-261-911,86

We explore the variability discrimination on the partial sameness by the means of experiments and theoretical models. In experiments, a set of bars with the aim orientation and random orientations are shown on a liquid crystal display (LCD), and the subjects judge the orientations of bars and record the number of bars with the same aim orientation. In comparative experiments, the three-digit integers replace the oriented bar as the new stimuli. By the visualized data of subjects, we find that the performances of subjects depend on the total number of bars (set size), the number of bars with the identical aim orientation and the standard deviation of the orientations’ distribution. Based on Bayesian theory, we put forward a model in visual search to judge how many bars with the same orientation. The results show that Bayesian discrimination model on this kind of classified judgment matches the experimental data better than the alternative model, and it provides a normative and quantitative description on the judgment of the partial sameness.",359,,163,172,Bayesian probability; Artificial intelligence; Visual search; Bayesian inference; Pattern recognition; Standard deviation; Theoretical models; Integer; Computer science; Normative; Experimental data,,,,National Natural Science Foundation of China; National Natural Science Foundation of China; State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures; State Key Laboratory of Mechanics and Control of Mechanical Structures; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities; Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0925231219307866 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijon/ijon359.html#ChenL19,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neucom.2019.05.072,,10.1016/j.neucom.2019.05.072,2947115356,,0,000-655-362-522-955; 003-946-963-737-096; 003-954-582-714-982; 004-837-887-130-48X; 008-810-004-535-607; 016-624-249-356-827; 016-882-466-390-660; 018-941-098-374-623; 019-775-966-509-90X; 019-907-085-939-215; 021-524-972-403-488; 024-007-778-066-645; 024-910-955-180-977; 026-075-573-927-058; 026-516-757-222-715; 027-460-399-436-049; 031-378-385-183-644; 031-393-589-871-858; 031-856-471-286-299; 032-919-099-634-593; 035-971-730-445-530; 036-654-581-457-948; 038-689-624-088-728; 039-925-932-854-541; 041-148-759-188-036; 043-442-121-212-746; 052-250-763-820-540; 055-939-348-227-319; 064-078-544-105-049; 074-598-964-536-381; 075-774-833-322-70X; 083-011-519-795-44X; 086-959-098-771-495; 087-077-553-083-806; 088-863-106-512-706; 089-258-131-989-582; 091-340-125-382-72X; 095-469-390-355-901; 100-353-682-320-393; 105-442-040-700-26X; 109-048-055-782-763; 109-776-139-597-392; 112-491-803-723-190; 123-110-496-139-142; 124-901-836-801-110; 126-417-574-526-320; 134-429-532-510-994; 143-747-950-320-077; 144-067-393-125-267; 145-974-736-653-99X; 148-286-480-443-779,1

The judgments in these experiments, however, have usually involved comparisons of multiple elements within a display, whereas the visually-guided actions have typically involved a pincer grip directed to only one display element. The three experiments presented here assess the influence of this confound on the perception versus action illusion dissociation. In general, the studies suggest (a) that the confound affects perceptual judgment but not grasping or manual estimation, and (b) that difficult visuomotor tasks are more affected by the Ebbinghaus illusion than easier tasks. In Experiment 1, participants reached for or made judgments about plastic disks placed in the center of the Ebbinghaus illusion display. Some participants reached for or made judgments about only the disk on the right, whereas others reached for or judged both disks simultaneously. A large effect of the illusion was found for grasping and comparative judgment, but not for manual estimation or metric judgment. In Experiment 2, the disks were elevated slightly to make gripping the targets easier, and the effects of the illusion on grasping were greatly reduced. For Experiment 3, participants performed the manual estimation task while the hands were placed in view, on the surface of the table, and the effects of the illusion were significantly increased. Taken together, the experiments indicate that task difficulty and hand visibility affect whether a task will be influenced by pictorial illusions or not. One- and two-handed grasping seem to be affected approximately equally.",16,3-4,377,392,,,Behavior/physiology; Female; Hand/physiology; Hand Strength/physiology; Humans; Judgment; Male; Optical Illusions/physiology; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Size Perception/physiology; Visual Perception,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12858958,12858958,,,,0,,1

Walsh; Federica Pazzaglia; Miranda Eng; Ali Dastmalchian,"Organizational members frequently evaluate how their abilities and standing compare with those of their colleagues. Although these comparisons can have a negative impact on organizations, little attention has been paid to the role of leaders in these processes. Drawing on interviews with individuals in leadership positions in business schools, we develop a framework to explain what triggers leaders' attention to social comparisons among faculty and how they become involved in them. Central to this framework are leaders' self-schemas, which encompass their preferences about the criteria members should use in making comparisons. Leaders' self-schemas are activated by discrepancies between their own comparative judgements and those they perceive members to be making and impel them to act in ways consistent with their preferred bases of comparison. Our framework repositions social comparisons as a multiperspectival, political phenomenon in which leaders see themselves as playing a role in shaping members' evaluations and workplace interactions.

Shah; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Adityanand Guntuboyina; Martin J. Wainwright,"There are various parametric models for analyzing pairwise comparison data, including the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and Thurstone models, but their reliance on strong parametric assumptions is limiting. In this work, we study a flexible model for pairwise comparisons, under which the probabilities of outcomes are required only to satisfy a natural form of stochastic transitivity. This class includes parametric models including the BTL and Thurstone models as special cases, but is considerably more general. We provide various examples of models in this broader stochastically transitive class for which classical parametric models provide poor fits. Despite this greater flexibility, we show that the matrix of probabilities can be estimated at the same rate as in standard parametric models. On the other hand, unlike in the BTL and Thurstone models, computing the minimax-optimal estimator in the stochastically transitive model is non-trivial, and we explore various computationally tractable alternatives. We show that a simple singular value thresholding algorithm is statistically consistent but does not achieve the minimax rate. We then propose and study algorithms that achieve the minimax rate over interesting sub-classes of the full stochastically transitive class. We complement our theoretical results with thorough numerical simulations.",,,,,Parametric statistics; Mathematical optimization; Matrix (mathematics); Minimax; Thurstone scale; Pairwise comparison; Estimator; Transitive relation; Parametric model; Mathematics,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v4 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05610 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05610 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1510.05610,https://arxiv.org/abs/1510.05610v4,,,1815702575,,0,016-138-352-817-050; 021-304-036-982-259; 025-009-658-071-875; 030-518-529-758-220; 033-139-527-666-540; 033-920-290-313-776; 034-901-673-085-689; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-829-579-281-766; 047-164-545-895-518; 050-943-988-713-681; 065-524-837-869-927; 067-860-359-894-241; 070-331-031-103-877; 075-208-362-608-800; 083-231-400-366-060; 085-982-503-333-800; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-081-068-281-719; 088-185-235-230-617; 090-675-229-255-539; 096-979-791-156-213; 097-492-503-037-095; 103-111-574-598-758; 105-197-803-566-972; 137-940-671-974-155; 147-543-426-548-72X; 147-790-916-717-782; 152-625-606-175-254; 152-760-702-983-990; 161-247-307-055-667; 181-375-967-075-390; 189-745-424-791-442,9

Research conducted so far focused on the level and scope of information exchange or marketing in general. However, an explanation to what degree communication, particularly taking into account buyer needs in communication, has an effect on buyer-salesperson relationships is absent. Therefore, this paper is based on the thesis that salesperson communication, at variance with buyer expectations, leads to deterioration of buyer's trust, satisfaction, commitment and willingness to recommend the salesperson.The paper defines elements of communication indispensable in maintaining relationships with specific parameters (trust, satisfaction, commitment and recommendation). It also indicates that the extent to which not adapting communication has an effect on the buyer-salesperson relationship does not depend on trust which buyers have in salespersons, compared to other sources of information.The effect of the paper is to indicate the areas of communication towards which a salesperson should direct their efforts and such areas, which, even if lacking conformity, do not have a negative effect on buyer-salesperson relationships.Keywords: communication behavior, interaction, adaptive selling, relationship effects, professional buyers behavior.JEL codes: D83, M30.IntroductionLoyalty of the business customer is based not only on product features but also on convergence of personal and social forces that exist between professional buy-* ers and key contact personnel within supplier firms [Oliver 1999]. The role of key contact personnel in satisfying customers in the business market is important [Bendapudi & Leone 2002; Homburg & Stock 2004]. Furthermore, it has been shown that well-functioning buyer-salesperson relationships improve the financial as well as non-financial performance of both buyers and salespersons [O'Toole & Donaldson 2002].Personal selling is - by nature - a personal communication that seeks to inform buyers about products in an exchange situation [Agnihotri et al. 2009] and relations and networks between enterprises are essentially formed through interpersonal communication [Olkkonen et al. 2000]. In the opinion of many authors communication is of key significance in the relationship process between buyers and salespersons. It can be perceived as the main element of the relationship [Guenzi et al. 2007]. Communication processes underline most aspects of organizational interaction and, therefore, are typically viewed as being critical to organizational success. Communication is treated as the essence of coordinating organisation behaviours and is defined as the ""glue"" holding together co-operating enterprises [Mohr & Nevin 1990]. The role of communication is so significant that it has been proposed to treat it as the basic index of a relationship lifespan [Mohr & Spekman 1994].The paper is based on the thesis that communication maybe one of the elements that shape buyer-salesperson relations. In general, research results indicate that there is a link between buyer-salesperson relations and their mutual communication [Webster & Sundaram 2009]. Based on the work of Oliver [1980], we assume that the chance of positive evaluation of communication with the salesperson by the buyer is related to their pre-interaction expectations that create a frame of reference from which a buyer makes post-interaction comparative judgments. When a judgment leads to a worse-than buyers frame of reference comparison than dissatisfaction likely occurs [Lewin 2009]. The paper is intended to show how a misalignment between a buyer s expectations and a salespersons communication performance impacts their relations.This issue is important due to the fact that customer (dis)satisfaction influences an organizations current and future performance [Anderson et al. …",13,2,107,136,Conformity; Business; Marketing; Interpersonal communication; Business communication; Information exchange; Element (criminal law); Willingness to recommend; Social force,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ekon-element-000171269323 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marek_Zielinski4/publication/267209001_The_impact_of_misaligned_business_communication_on_the_quality_of_salesperson_-_buyer_relationships/links/544790970cf2f14fb81201ed.pdf,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ekon-element-000171269323,,,314159838,,0,001-262-274-011-134; 003-084-348-532-332; 004-640-888-940-610; 005-588-571-784-921; 005-672-043-299-545; 006-320-981-482-976; 008-432-011-808-903; 009-271-041-555-187; 010-163-507-959-472; 010-441-278-222-908; 010-824-216-323-525; 011-565-159-077-219; 012-510-026-366-111; 014-602-011-287-948; 015-716-952-212-325; 017-078-832-275-507; 017-153-410-748-308; 018-178-062-705-340; 019-020-244-636-282; 023-462-427-706-24X; 023-910-952-590-800; 025-712-269-646-887; 027-974-052-497-705; 028-008-575-786-028; 028-233-354-780-897; 029-174-075-782-848; 030-469-876-801-07X; 032-836-393-727-80X; 033-286-180-588-415; 034-038-360-257-676; 035-525-323-772-083; 037-493-408-229-206; 040-281-723-610-852; 041-395-161-455-169; 041-793-283-939-050; 044-385-711-591-131; 044-783-242-646-876; 047-222-575-724-931; 048-744-725-668-352; 049-636-752-392-951; 051-290-912-151-679; 052-362-312-490-358; 053-397-822-509-668; 054-137-801-476-049; 054-961-275-251-194; 061-005-178-204-736; 061-220-032-764-871; 064-960-065-786-13X; 067-541-432-012-13X; 067-673-874-183-483; 068-711-962-737-694; 070-716-268-076-683; 071-645-334-936-305; 071-809-059-091-894; 072-152-978-208-427; 075-018-831-496-091; 076-501-913-421-903; 078-334-904-031-839; 081-017-778-263-338; 083-378-997-729-878; 083-445-956-937-23X; 085-736-870-338-589; 086-056-818-727-517; 087-040-790-275-319; 088-863-005-694-619; 090-545-989-694-74X; 092-332-899-240-932; 092-415-322-898-143; 095-169-018-464-779; 099-032-235-128-390; 105-316-531-287-724; 109-583-839-751-214; 110-710-767-270-263; 111-234-111-001-097; 113-377-188-742-45X; 113-565-849-458-391; 119-261-292-107-88X; 120-948-912-813-782; 122-376-968-612-471; 122-919-060-524-111; 123-345-202-853-946; 129-386-946-517-725; 134-646-380-579-722; 136-165-427-562-561; 138-229-958-513-69X; 144-129-367-755-450; 148-589-908-032-689; 149-268-497-297-541; 154-163-777-383-030; 161-297-661-636-478; 164-523-589-991-222; 165-172-055-997-384; 165-444-389-069-090; 167-637-315-610-490; 168-666-202-411-208; 181-141-634-450-605; 188-960-358-416-948,4

In this line of research the confluence of polychronicity and information processing (e.g., the ability of individuals to process stimuli from the environment along five dimensions of information load, interpersonal load, change load, time structure, and activity structure) is applied to the occupational environment. Using magnitude estimation scaling, college students in the United States and Portugal rated 42 occupations across five information processing demand characteristics. Results indicated that occupations could be differentiated by the information load conditions, thus producing a profile of information processing demand characteristics unique to each of the occupations tested. Additional findings provided evidence for the validity of the scaled occupational values; ratings differed reliably across Holland categories, were fairly consistent across the two cultural groups, and showed expected relationships with salary and educational level.",79,2,403,413,Demand characteristics; Psychology; Interpersonal communication; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Person–environment fit; Salary; Cultural group selection; Social psychology; Information processing; Scaling,,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/19131981 https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/handle/10316/17977 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ936833 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001879110001909 https://estudogeral.sib.uc.pt/bitstream/10316/17977/1/Scaling%20the%20information%20processing%20demands%20of%20occupations.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/144022920.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jvb.2010.11.004,,10.1016/j.jvb.2010.11.004,2042527187,,0,007-214-279-490-244; 007-969-480-332-315; 010-423-042-177-734; 015-694-360-571-063; 016-047-906-897-926; 019-225-780-971-630; 028-219-621-836-381; 028-808-157-009-723; 029-067-537-381-739; 037-214-599-469-071; 038-076-824-391-033; 044-998-759-817-998; 055-807-088-113-125; 057-423-119-898-798; 060-894-586-278-917; 061-069-334-720-293; 062-600-213-342-214; 071-757-670-268-664; 076-789-172-721-292; 078-391-324-935-349; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-203-217-986-699; 087-542-937-287-315; 089-636-139-343-423; 094-106-508-952-64X; 111-685-276-532-817; 116-060-010-262-17X; 125-129-951-713-242; 126-116-603-025-56X; 129-440-564-089-213; 129-851-969-304-440; 137-892-123-889-853; 142-539-499-807-434; 149-504-293-235-201; 152-671-577-558-252; 168-592-746-012-732; 170-383-846-671-525,3

Although this method is promising in terms of obtaining reliable scores, empirical evidence concerning its validity is lacking. The current study examines implications resulting from two critical assumptions underpinning the use of comparative judgement, namely: its holistic characteristic and how the final rank order reflects the shared consensus on what makes for a good essay. Judges’ justifications that underpin their decisions are qualitatively analysed to obtain insight into the dimensions of academic writing they take into account. The results show that most arguments are directly related to the competence description. However, judges also use their expertise in order to judge the quality of essays. Additionally, judges differ in terms of how they conceptualise writing quality, and regarding the extent to which they tap into their own expertise. Finally, this study explores diverging conceptualis...",26,1,59,74,Competence (human resources); Epistemology; Academic writing; Psychology; Empirical evidence; Ranking; Judgement; Value judgment; Underpinning; Inter-rater reliability; Social psychology,,,,Flanders Innovation & Entrepreneurship and the Research Foundation,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1206779 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/0969594X.2016.1253542 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:184263,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/0969594x.2016.1253542,,10.1080/0969594x.2016.1253542,2554609727,,0,018-269-445-638-29X; 020-921-378-889-641; 030-544-967-337-273; 033-896-251-435-132; 034-259-628-733-602; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-416-173-942-082; 037-550-015-414-716; 037-819-411-294-305; 043-993-488-611-488; 044-803-196-956-309; 047-410-827-372-679; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 059-188-701-225-287; 063-436-530-380-198; 064-879-962-697-761; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-715-519-706-692; 087-991-691-200-809; 095-628-034-398-740; 102-955-514-174-383; 107-790-959-417-375; 115-102-354-884-075; 115-174-428-198-91X; 124-035-717-834-982; 127-916-248-181-737; 175-755-079-554-999; 177-072-688-486-223; 183-914-972-982-465,18

Ideally, open and real-life tasks are used for such performance assessment. However, to augment the reliability of the scores resulting from performance assessment, assessments are mostly standardised. This hampers the validity of the performance assessment. Comparative judgement (CJ) is introduced as an alternative judging method that does not require standardisation of tasks. The CJ method is based on the assumption that people are able to compare two performances more easily and reliable than assigning a score to a single one. This chapter provides insight in the method and elaborates on why this method is promising to generate valid, reliable measures in an efficient way, especially for large-scale summative assessments. Thereby, this chapter brings together the research already conducted in this new assessment domain. </jats:p>",,,119,138,Competence (human resources); Psychology; Judgement; Medical education,,,,,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/comparative-judgement-as-a-promising-alternative-to-score-competences/159970 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:184261,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-0531-0.ch007,,10.4018/978-1-5225-0531-0.ch007,2485396921,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 008-661-505-775-063; 014-008-170-232-731; 015-610-828-146-943; 016-279-152-792-986; 016-352-031-372-553; 017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 020-921-378-889-641; 021-738-595-719-412; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-416-173-942-082; 038-896-674-017-161; 041-210-265-147-079; 043-993-488-611-488; 045-627-278-090-39X; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 059-188-701-225-287; 059-647-472-149-611; 066-287-279-828-150; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-984-758-155-23X; 068-124-584-046-362; 069-107-065-440-634; 070-955-402-063-882; 076-050-960-166-845; 091-132-647-349-699; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-192-239-503-399; 105-060-972-080-52X; 106-532-502-155-602; 106-667-816-493-880; 107-790-959-417-375; 108-384-135-247-839; 115-102-354-884-075; 127-916-248-181-737; 143-327-887-855-405; 155-604-905-636-918; 156-536-166-107-928; 168-704-895-296-891; 177-072-688-486-223; 190-033-355-094-175; 199-435-723-761-218; 199-665-658-004-010,13

Usually only maintenance activities related costs are considered to derive the cost function. However, in deregulated markets, maintenance related costs alone do not represent the full costs of generators. This paper models various cost components that affect the maintenance activities in deregulated power markets. The costs that we model include direct and indirect maintenance, failures, interruptions, contractual compensation, rescheduling, and market opportunity. The loss of firm’s reputation and selection of loyalty model are also considered using the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) within an opportunity cost model. A case study is used to illustrate the modelling activities. The enhanced model is utilised in generator maintenance scheduling cases.

In this paper, I present a further reason to doubt the epistemic merits of IBE and argue that it motivates moving to an inferential pattern in which IBE emerges as a degenerate limiting case. Since this inferential pattern is structurally similar to an argumentative strategy known as Inferential Robustness Analysis (IRA), it effectively combines the most attractive features of IBE and IRA into a unified approach to non-deductive inference.",77,1,20,29,Data mining; Artificial intelligence; RNA world hypothesis; Frequentist inference; Limiting; Inference; License; Argumentative; Computer science; Predictive inference; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/bitstream/10197/8412/1/Abductively_Robust_Inference_Penultimate.pdf https://www.philarchive.org/rec/DELARI http://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/77/1/20/3101348 https://core.ac.uk/display/131211871 https://academic.oup.com/analysis/article-abstract/77/1/20/3101348 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/15535/ https://researchrepository.ucd.ie/handle/10197/8412 https://philpapers.org/rec/DELARI,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/analys/anx049,,10.1093/analys/anx049,2600067976,,0,000-246-089-493-024; 008-157-384-726-368; 013-273-216-986-549; 022-181-996-276-924; 025-635-329-358-275; 028-697-146-044-751; 034-862-053-128-060; 041-499-758-869-707; 041-724-921-575-089; 045-448-086-068-928; 050-191-293-073-105; 058-783-220-768-045; 067-098-026-382-035; 070-098-787-102-227; 075-826-283-379-956; 098-003-834-249-451; 102-382-044-596-614; 124-820-685-385-978; 134-581-102-739-445; 179-699-843-155-566,24

McMahon; Greig I. de Zubicaray,"Long-lasting interference effects in picture naming are induced when objects are presented in categorically related contexts in both continuous and blocked cyclic paradigms. Less consistent context effects have been reported when the task is changed to semantic classification. Experiment 1 confirmed the recent finding of cumulative facilitation in the continuous paradigm with living/non-living superordinate categorization. To avoid a potential confound involving participants responding with the identical superordinate category in related contexts in the blocked cyclic paradigm, we devised a novel set of categorically related objects that also varied in terms of relative age – a core semantic type associated with the adjective word class across languages. Experiment 2 demonstrated the typical interference effect with these stimuli in basic level naming. In Experiment 3, using the identical blocked cyclic paradigm, we failed to observe semantic context effects when the same pictures were classified as younger–older. Overall, the results indicate the semantic context effects in the two paradigms do not share a common origin, with the effect in the continuous paradigm arising at the level of conceptual representations or in conceptual-to-lexical connections while the effect in the blocked cyclic paradigm most likely originates at a lexical level of representation. The implications of these findings for current accounts of long-lasting interference effects in spoken word production are discussed.",6,578,578,578,Part of speech; Facilitation; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Language production; Adjective; Linguistics; Context effect; Superordinate goals; Categorization,language production; lexical retrieval; semantic interference,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:363985 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00578/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4423345/ https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/longlasting-semantic-interference-effects-object-naming-not-necessarily-conceptually-mediated/ https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/05c9ffd8-0ad0-3695-a7e9-a3c61404396c/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82885720 https://philpapers.org/rec/RILLSI http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4423345 https://eprints.qut.edu.au/86249/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00578/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82885720.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00578,25999892,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00578,2067802449,PMC4423345,0,001-440-345-724-174; 001-896-494-429-887; 002-895-824-826-060; 003-605-412-190-973; 005-085-172-809-584; 005-950-880-484-665; 007-286-374-894-311; 008-192-712-366-191; 008-939-069-515-209; 009-713-147-407-25X; 010-079-279-579-037; 011-087-418-438-848; 014-443-705-685-160; 014-980-302-894-316; 015-004-598-054-129; 015-011-760-968-97X; 016-476-709-186-768; 017-975-928-889-247; 018-781-528-222-92X; 022-898-622-903-848; 027-017-498-407-095; 028-219-799-322-724; 028-461-943-403-04X; 029-947-321-111-567; 031-720-968-615-075; 032-642-951-347-284; 032-899-845-122-499; 033-093-308-677-740; 034-108-725-971-778; 035-412-060-705-688; 038-337-207-647-366; 041-262-005-226-955; 044-821-228-445-669; 045-224-889-688-79X; 045-653-278-893-378; 047-156-454-183-195; 049-537-511-310-210; 051-006-815-865-855; 052-877-448-730-464; 055-348-471-524-517; 055-685-877-549-172; 055-779-402-282-651; 056-434-633-232-961; 058-885-496-313-225; 058-907-212-197-90X; 061-107-370-320-785; 061-804-886-551-078; 063-098-228-623-17X; 071-970-883-642-608; 074-937-169-278-567; 075-219-734-918-919; 076-275-157-917-360; 076-354-078-303-69X; 077-344-568-955-313; 078-962-577-431-882; 101-048-907-419-155; 101-154-605-630-077; 103-586-670-587-791; 103-951-390-405-423; 109-208-873-250-726; 111-441-229-433-583; 113-202-026-236-98X; 120-750-225-281-08X; 125-480-094-544-525; 132-824-206-429-602; 147-116-449-419-852; 150-711-068-636-09X; 153-765-959-787-919; 156-102-405-141-229; 173-829-995-279-749; 191-567-316-745-273; 196-022-041-043-935,11

Heitzeg; Lora M. Cope; Meghan E. Martz; Jillian E. Hardee; Robert A. Zucker,"This work investigated the impact of heavy marijuana use during adolescence on emotional functioning, as well as the brain functional mediators of this effect. Participants (n=40) were recruited from the Michigan Longitudinal Study (MLS). Data on marijuana use were collected prospectively beginning in childhood as part of the MLS. Participants were classified as heavy marijuana users (n=20) or controls with minimal marijuana use. Two facets of emotional functioning-negative emotionality and resiliency (a self-regulatory mechanism)-were assessed as part of the MLS at three time points: mean age 13.4, mean age 19.6, and mean age 23.1. Functional neuroimaging data during an emotion-arousal word task were collected at mean age 20.2. Negative emotionality decreased and resiliency increased across the three time points in controls but not heavy marijuana users. Compared with controls, heavy marijuana users had less activation to negative words in temporal, prefrontal, and occipital cortices, insula, and amygdala. Activation of dorsolateral prefrontal cortex to negative words mediated an association between marijuana group and later negative emotionality. Activation of the cuneus/lingual gyrus mediated an association between marijuana group and later resiliency. Results support growing evidence that heavy marijuana use during adolescence affects later emotional outcomes.",16,,71,83,Insula; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Emotionality; Lingual gyrus; Longitudinal study; Dorsolateral prefrontal cortex; Cuneus; Arousal; Functional neuroimaging,Amygdala; Cannabis; Emotion; Insula; Mediation; fMRI,"Adolescent; Age of Onset; Amygdala/physiopathology; Arousal/drug effects; Brain/drug effects; Cerebral Cortex/physiopathology; Child; Emotions/drug effects; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Marijuana Abuse/physiopathology; Neuropsychological Tests; Prospective Studies; Resilience, Psychological/drug effects; Young Adult",,NIDA NIH HHS (T32 DA007267) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (R01 DA027261) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (T32 AA007477) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (T32 AA07477) United States; NIDA NIH HHS (T32 DA007268) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (R01 AA07065) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (R01 AA007065) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (R01 AA012217) United States; NIAAA NIH HHS (R01 AA12217) United States,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929315000894 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1878929315000894 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4691419 https://core.ac.uk/display/82306045 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82306045.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2015.09.003,26403581,10.1016/j.dcn.2015.09.003,2207500197,PMC4691419,0,000-125-181-498-310; 001-458-983-927-019; 001-734-751-970-323; 002-072-791-219-805; 002-557-891-784-292; 002-821-366-510-576; 004-166-742-730-308; 004-199-662-832-305; 005-729-460-151-36X; 009-306-605-454-371; 009-444-594-442-214; 010-074-195-433-898; 010-526-170-958-959; 010-908-221-156-555; 011-073-045-383-073; 011-747-656-274-78X; 011-906-207-070-170; 012-523-431-912-799; 012-998-325-766-248; 013-240-971-054-760; 013-531-955-585-967; 014-442-824-039-693; 014-739-966-698-253; 015-020-151-120-45X; 016-330-238-010-026; 017-046-577-166-453; 017-521-779-565-268; 018-108-544-537-26X; 018-134-258-364-248; 019-468-483-097-998; 019-774-600-490-226; 022-297-410-048-540; 022-564-363-094-504; 022-581-465-283-810; 022-929-463-565-886; 024-321-421-916-219; 025-271-895-167-524; 025-450-833-881-718; 026-911-860-929-612; 028-656-533-624-958; 031-317-447-518-958; 031-930-400-803-888; 032-152-918-661-122; 032-957-381-941-463; 034-132-762-230-928; 034-428-350-211-811; 034-889-037-126-655; 034-910-304-681-455; 035-601-583-247-56X; 037-570-475-692-635; 037-721-901-647-577; 037-978-411-020-61X; 038-429-786-221-463; 039-782-626-588-26X; 040-149-057-837-95X; 040-324-256-206-486; 042-202-753-183-120; 042-611-644-613-977; 043-099-062-275-142; 044-696-704-153-713; 045-136-197-938-057; 046-297-532-065-737; 046-555-464-857-538; 048-624-014-798-074; 050-671-715-707-490; 051-616-224-806-659; 051-774-409-470-374; 053-074-722-323-309; 054-305-659-174-110; 057-866-146-857-986; 058-466-358-405-811; 060-322-166-788-327; 062-148-675-609-843; 062-306-926-578-107; 063-432-783-260-372; 064-050-533-299-795; 066-608-905-207-154; 068-225-137-701-399; 069-430-117-486-731; 073-383-900-372-520; 073-571-369-676-092; 076-125-838-896-282; 077-047-508-186-03X; 079-251-974-139-223; 081-609-998-551-322; 086-161-168-744-458; 089-682-968-864-741; 090-000-611-552-942; 090-162-833-408-411; 091-062-530-945-605; 096-700-222-452-61X; 098-915-760-738-894; 099-867-965-598-939; 100-306-908-877-644; 101-260-949-608-999; 101-261-801-186-886; 101-950-137-718-533; 108-733-527-605-570; 110-602-776-687-839; 113-973-431-964-847; 122-345-141-590-057; 124-195-699-335-006; 125-264-858-062-379; 127-620-993-493-471; 129-649-583-974-987; 135-859-125-884-063; 136-432-963-197-629; 137-020-518-757-849; 138-987-553-314-169; 142-352-065-260-670; 149-942-899-361-325; 151-240-566-313-013; 153-261-264-084-839; 163-671-892-911-30X; 168-972-398-676-173; 194-176-643-230-032,27

Rose; John D. Jasper; Ryan Corser,"Previous research has shown that people are egocentrically biased when making judgements that require a self-to-peer comparison – leading to above-/below-average effects and comparative optimism/pessimism. Two experiments examined whether interhemispheric brain connectivity (assessed via strength of handedness) is associated with egocentrism in the comparative judgement process. In Experiment 1, strong handers (SH) and mixed handers (MH) made percentile rank judgements about their abilities in easy and hard domains. In Experiment 2, SH and MH judged their likelihoods of outperforming a co-participant in easy and hard tasks. Both experiments showed that SH were more egocentric than MH and thus showed (a) more above- and below-average effects when estimating their abilities (Experiment 1) and (b) generally larger optimism biases when predicting performances in a competition (Experiment 2). Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that underlying interhemispheric connectivity shapes egocentrism in comparative judgement.",51,1,111,129,Chirality (physics); Developmental psychology; Psychology; Egocentrism; Optimism; Judgement; Social psychology; Percentile rank; Pessimism,,Analysis of Variance; Attitude; Brain/physiology; Defense Mechanisms; Female; Functional Laterality/physiology; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Social Identification,,,https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Jasper3/publication/50194963_Interhemispheric_interaction_and_egocentrism_the_role_of_handedness_in_social_comparative_judgement/links/0c96052c346b44b16b000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21348882,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x,21348882,10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x,1492817948,,0,001-249-077-153-794; 001-539-529-845-798; 001-808-120-697-091; 003-669-005-236-674; 004-688-760-041-053; 005-034-929-971-058; 006-981-763-398-491; 007-560-852-560-666; 007-778-725-444-103; 009-493-201-031-23X; 012-419-306-168-454; 014-419-216-898-317; 015-156-981-167-516; 016-096-789-488-138; 016-137-262-831-356; 017-870-813-973-309; 018-347-300-569-415; 018-412-222-408-808; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-419-379-272-121; 022-187-949-595-874; 023-996-080-454-552; 025-291-229-702-511; 025-736-055-916-542; 029-209-500-575-442; 029-749-319-520-866; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-775-636-977-576; 032-799-942-231-090; 034-520-222-312-601; 037-674-524-591-483; 042-844-485-627-526; 043-341-357-838-945; 045-983-155-239-490; 048-587-072-525-736; 050-175-348-930-494; 053-640-820-450-620; 060-577-386-644-004; 061-082-122-262-098; 061-650-648-178-993; 062-431-143-205-980; 065-586-050-983-471; 066-608-905-207-154; 068-410-555-445-345; 069-040-474-230-271; 070-851-889-124-571; 074-038-324-174-292; 077-027-482-740-259; 078-837-899-642-591; 080-797-985-956-755; 082-662-120-833-072; 089-432-960-725-948; 101-407-970-642-140; 102-795-542-679-792; 105-433-720-062-009; 105-902-036-518-531; 107-601-077-156-243; 107-854-421-865-889; 109-607-523-283-358; 113-742-786-658-533; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-802-198-906-335; 120-458-466-449-922; 124-656-535-257-223; 133-444-859-830-606; 133-832-343-444-047; 136-272-860-034-114; 140-397-553-301-28X; 143-527-773-731-849; 167-796-474-873-982; 168-786-159-943-378; 180-077-537-443-884; 181-166-614-027-51X,9

Wilson; Andrew J. Woods,"Background: It is possible to find many different visual representations of data values in visualizations, it is less common to see visual representations that include uncertainty, especially in visualizations intended for non-technical audiences. Objective: our aim is to rigorously define and evaluate the novel use of visual entropy as a measure of shape that allows us to construct an ordered scale of glyphs for use in representing both uncertainty and value in 2D and 3D environments. Method: We use sample entropy as a numerical measure of visual entropy to construct a set of glyphs using R and Blender which vary in their complexity. Results: A Bradley-Terry analysis of a pairwise comparison of the glyphs shows participants (n=19) ordered the glyphs as predicted by the visual entropy score (linear regression R2 >0.97, p<0.001). We also evaluate whether the glyphs can effectively represent uncertainty using a signal detection method, participants (n=15) were able to search for glyphs representing uncertainty with high sensitivity and low error rates. Conclusion: visual entropy is a novel cue for representing ordered data and provides a channel that allows the uncertainty of a measure to be presented alongside its mean value.",,,,,Glyph; Detection theory; Artificial intelligence; Communication channel; Pattern recognition; Pairwise comparison; Mathematics; Visualization; Linear regression; Sample entropy; Entropy (information theory),,,,,https://eprints.ncl.ac.uk/260498 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12879.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/1907.12879 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019arXiv190712879H/abstract https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1907.html#abs-1907-12879,http://arxiv.org/pdf/1907.12879.pdf,,,2964697968,,0,000-043-712-799-827; 001-211-147-613-925; 003-814-258-171-918; 004-012-509-145-426; 010-423-042-177-734; 011-881-024-835-013; 011-930-712-854-515; 023-277-795-406-852; 033-986-612-666-34X; 037-094-759-392-621; 040-732-187-002-203; 049-925-401-891-266; 051-905-742-573-622; 055-154-490-994-447; 059-829-121-603-170; 063-573-715-923-890; 065-224-283-104-249; 088-631-259-327-891; 091-779-347-544-561; 093-590-391-710-700; 093-777-579-535-297; 105-512-907-447-406; 109-350-109-491-919; 119-557-177-631-582; 128-172-887-230-109; 132-423-583-829-356; 133-030-412-896-30X; 166-538-828-667-900; 168-781-765-079-070; 168-788-495-210-658; 175-755-079-554-999; 176-828-971-357-858; 189-338-298-237-767,2

With the help of a case study example, the process involved in the NFDSS and the methodology of evaluation are illustrated.

Zhang,"We consider the problem of ranking $n$ players from partial pairwise comparison data under the Bradley-Terry-Luce model. For the first time in the literature, the minimax rate of this ranking problem is derived with respect to the Kendall's tau distance that measures the difference between two rank vectors by counting the number of inversions. The minimax rate of ranking exhibits a transition between an exponential rate and a polynomial rate depending on the magnitude of the signal-to-noise ratio of the problem. To the best of our knowledge, this phenomenon is unique to full ranking and has not been seen in any other statistical estimation problem. To achieve the minimax rate, we propose a divide-and-conquer ranking algorithm that first divides the $n$ players into groups of similar skills and then computes local MLE within each group. The optimality of the proposed algorithm is established by a careful approximate independence argument between the two steps.",,,,,Minimax; Exponential function; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Applied mathematics; Mathematics; Magnitude (mathematics); Inversion (meteorology); Polynomial,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08421.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.08421,https://arxiv.org/pdf/2101.08421.pdf,,,3121377464,,0,010-492-501-069-476; 015-164-124-848-632; 015-981-703-064-218; 016-027-335-594-009; 018-269-445-638-29X; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-501-390-008-829; 026-406-973-799-802; 027-048-508-707-668; 027-408-896-252-090; 027-481-550-045-191; 027-896-243-015-499; 030-289-090-008-522; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-627-416-303-850; 047-307-839-107-965; 052-731-553-260-693; 053-013-800-478-068; 055-894-748-477-45X; 056-717-302-816-604; 057-657-809-679-383; 057-708-727-147-25X; 075-539-693-388-757; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-131-898-512-375; 087-143-628-955-908; 088-081-068-281-719; 092-474-419-202-077; 094-630-349-889-33X; 095-172-407-515-485; 098-376-587-660-420; 109-668-006-494-690; 111-358-495-245-06X; 120-889-720-304-863; 121-442-560-587-280; 123-162-762-225-639; 126-998-030-149-801; 130-147-900-808-751; 139-649-897-193-545; 153-906-359-466-085; 158-229-170-355-898; 158-687-817-281-331; 161-247-307-055-667; 185-191-807-545-399; 186-465-595-270-910; 187-579-971-923-156; 195-685-864-553-865,0

Abbatiello,"Abstract : This thesis investigates the employment of British aircraft against German submarines during the final years of the First World War, an issue that appears only marginally in other studies because it does not clearly fall into naval or air power history. A focused study is needed to assess the effectiveness of the effort and the veracity of the secondary literature. The Royal Naval Air Service invested heavily in aircraft of all types in order to counter the U-boat. Under the Royal Air Force, the air campaign against U-boats continued uninterrupted. Aircraft bombed German U-boat bases in Flanders, conducted area and hunting patrols around the coasts of Britain, and escorted merchant convoys to safety. Despite the fact that aircraft acting alone destroyed only one U-boat during the war, their overall contribution to foiling U-boat attacks was significant. Only five merchant vessels succumbed to submarine attack when convoyed by a combined air and surface escort during World War I. This thesis is organised thematically. Early chapters examine the aircraft and weapons technology, aircrew training, and aircraft production issues that shaped this campaign. Then, a close examination of anti-submarine operations that is, bombing, patrols, and escort yields a significantly different judgment from existing interpretations of these operations. A chapter on the British official assessments, which provided a basis for much of the secondary literature, demonstrates that this campaign was often misrepresented because it was either used to promote specific agendas or it was inappropriately employed as evidence in unrelated historical arguments. The next chapter examines the German view of aircraft effectiveness, through German actions, prisoner interrogations, official histories, and memoirs, to provide a comparative judgment. The conclusion closes with a brief narrative of post-war air anti-submarine developments and a summary of findings.",,,,,Submarine; Engineering; German; Memoir; Aeronautics; Aircrew; Military history; Anti-submarine warfare; Aviation; Forensic engineering; Spanish Civil War,,,,,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA425512 https://apps.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/a425512.pdf,https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/citations/ADA425512,,,319156425,,0,,1

Hierarchical regression results show that comparative judgements do not have any incremental effect in predicting job insecurity above self esteem. Self esteem predicts 21% variance in job insecurity.

While their over-riding expectation or hope is usually to enhance learning in a specific area, other possible outcomes may include reaching more students, providing experiences otherwise impossible, offering flexible access to a wider range of information, encouraging rehearsal and practice in virtual environments, the development of more generic skills - including the use of computers themselves. Unless these expectations are made explicit, the impact or effectiveness of the technological solution cannot be measured against its own goals. Ongoing evaluation in use can subsequently feed into quality improvement cycles.; ; In other situations, comparative judgements are sought but in many ways this approach is difficult. There is by no means agreement on the best methods of evaluation, even for the most basic of questions: Is the technology more effective in enhancing students' learning than are the alternatives it replaces? Is it cost-effective? Is it received better by the students? Conventional teaching methods have by no means always been evaluated rigorously, so the baselines for comparison are lacking or flawed. Complex variables (characteristics of the program in which the technology is embedded, students, teachers) inevitably confound any differences found, so absolute judgements are rarely possible.; ; Nevertheless, some strategies for evaluation have evolved and are often very effective within a local context.

Ninety-four six- to seven-year-old Chinese children completed a norm-referenced test for oral language and for literacy, as well as cognitive tasks related to reading development. Based on results from the norm-referenced tests, 40 children fell in the typically-developing Control group, 10 children in the dyslexia-only (D) group, 19 in the SLI-only group and 25 children in the SLI-D group. Orthographic skills and lexical access and retrieval skills were found to be associated with dyslexia. Phonological memory and morphological awareness were associated with SLI. Phonological awareness was associated with both SLI and dyslexia.

Although this technique can be applied to a variety of decision-making problems in the manufacturing field, it is limited by a response mode requiring the formulation of complete preference rankings, i.e., rankings that include all objects. Unfortunately, this model is unsuitable for some practical contexts—such as decision-making problems characterized by a relatively large number of objects and field surveys—where respondents can barely identify the more/less preferred objects, without realistically being able to construct complete preference rankings. The purpose of this paper is to develop a new technique (denominated “ZMII”) which also “tolerates” incomplete preference rankings, e.g., rankings with the more/less preferred objects only. This technique borrows the underlying postulates from the Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment and uses the Generalized Least Squares method to obtain a ratio scaling of the objects of interest, with a relevant uncertainty estimation. Preliminary results show the effectiveness of the new technique even for relatively incomplete preference rankings.

Recent research provided converging evidence that the NTA occurs at the stage of temporal memory. Specifically, a reference memory containing encoded duration information can be modified by perceptual/concurrent digits, i.e., a perceptual/concurrent digit-induced NTA. Here, with 5 experiments, we investigated whether another working memory-related mechanism was involved in the generation of NTAs and how this memory-induced NTA was related with the perception-induced NTA. We first explored whether similar NTA effects existed for mnemonic digits which disappeared before time encoding but were actively maintained in working memory, i.e. a mnemonic digit-induced NTA. Experiment 1 to 3 demonstrated both types of NTAs. Further, we revealed a close relationship between the two types of NTAs upon two aspects. First, the mnemonic digit-induced NTA also relied on a perceptual number-time co-occurrence at time encoding. We found that the mnemonic digits influenced subsequent temporal processing when a task-irrelevant constant number ‘5’ was presented during target encoding, but not when a non-numerical symbol was presented, suggesting that temporal representations in the reference memory could be accessed and modified by both sensory and postsensory numerical magnitudes through this number-time co-occurrence. Second, the effects of perceptual and mnemonic digits on temporal reproduction could cancel each other out. A congruency effect for perceptual and mnemonic digits (relying on memorization requirement) was demonstrated in Experiment 4 & 5. Specifically, a typical NTA was observed when the magnitudes of memorized and the perceptual/concurrent digits were congruent (both were large or small numbers), but not when they were incongruent (one small and one large numbers). Taken together, our study shed new light on the mechanism of NTA.",7,,2014,2014,Encoding (memory); Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Mnemonic; Working memory; Perception; Speech recognition; Memorization; Sensory system; Correlation and dependence,congruency effect; digits; memory; number-time association (NTA); perception,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC5220076 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02014 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28119643 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02014/full https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28119643/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82876887 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82876887.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02014,28119643,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.02014,2567761213,PMC5220076,0,000-495-638-642-502; 003-517-634-948-495; 004-375-154-319-425; 005-285-622-509-236; 005-881-575-136-027; 006-068-486-215-537; 006-185-874-197-804; 007-996-363-197-55X; 009-420-062-605-493; 010-629-061-233-301; 012-918-775-993-816; 013-539-975-565-02X; 014-443-705-685-160; 015-555-447-330-617; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-392-407-990-568; 018-156-085-944-945; 018-973-905-978-682; 020-328-989-578-60X; 020-903-397-577-96X; 024-084-763-466-370; 024-403-671-372-719; 027-884-546-674-856; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-017-432-413-618; 030-086-507-490-175; 031-324-485-402-628; 031-905-408-865-536; 033-236-541-618-750; 033-663-259-971-266; 034-838-893-430-086; 034-982-292-185-771; 036-277-797-873-691; 039-712-756-218-941; 041-323-502-321-36X; 045-359-699-596-614; 046-229-560-837-277; 047-242-580-763-167; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-698-834-805-737; 049-548-391-289-173; 050-520-388-037-080; 051-441-127-702-039; 051-662-901-467-39X; 053-865-202-710-306; 060-645-774-719-735; 062-391-552-594-047; 071-374-971-399-15X; 072-507-549-846-500; 072-821-793-404-62X; 073-305-823-347-060; 074-056-138-033-479; 080-354-103-723-747; 085-174-737-891-965; 090-357-903-385-682; 094-388-504-655-910; 103-974-904-022-158; 111-814-769-894-689; 115-874-449-070-023; 130-311-347-164-699; 141-193-885-537-629,1

Two aspects are quintessential for maximal learning outcomes among diverse learners: positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI). Consequently, this study validates an instrument to measure teachers’ reasoning with regard to PTSI and DI using explorative and confirmatory factor analyses. A total of 991 teachers and 3011 pre-service teachers indicated how crucial PTSI- and DI-arguments were in their comparative judgement of videoclips. Results show that the latent construct of PTSI consist of three subdimensions: individual needs, safe & structured environment, and student involvement. The latent construct of DI consists of four subdimensions: active learning, instructional clarity, adaptive teaching, and flexible grouping. The robustness of these findings across contexts demonstrates the centrality of these dimensions in teachers’ reasoning about inclusive classrooms.",67,,100912,,Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Active learning; Judgement; CLARITY; Notice; Differentiated instruction; Centrality; Physical education,,,,Agency for Innovation and Enterprise (VLAIO) from Flanders,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8672189 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X20301607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2020.100912,,10.1016/j.stueduc.2020.100912,3046148393,,0,004-876-137-453-070; 004-945-538-115-570; 005-925-916-359-467; 007-598-909-438-594; 008-358-455-606-146; 009-148-822-033-388; 011-241-688-325-045; 011-395-301-396-730; 012-840-615-642-032; 013-149-886-595-274; 014-178-357-512-399; 015-967-135-935-271; 017-727-096-692-499; 018-104-018-970-17X; 018-866-489-276-134; 019-466-517-214-63X; 025-970-561-198-85X; 026-678-569-918-08X; 028-237-692-601-482; 030-619-394-339-83X; 032-113-282-979-159; 032-182-993-297-073; 035-325-670-176-458; 049-222-787-035-049; 054-661-068-596-232; 054-926-759-602-743; 058-351-505-190-778; 058-605-022-037-864; 064-731-590-809-679; 069-929-829-230-278; 070-070-847-038-059; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-527-957-682-219; 079-511-034-510-908; 079-827-807-232-315; 082-680-397-981-747; 084-735-998-604-515; 089-568-668-795-714; 098-583-662-995-899; 099-014-289-384-34X; 099-380-048-532-962; 103-241-685-940-304; 103-993-374-943-761; 107-600-359-892-383; 116-082-116-295-815; 116-953-447-460-185; 118-658-396-717-120; 123-048-918-232-925; 125-606-263-553-977; 125-894-267-538-829; 125-901-333-223-044; 126-292-923-823-985; 130-246-310-273-826; 132-784-070-412-495; 134-665-917-858-507; 135-089-625-164-101; 140-304-094-926-401; 142-295-997-236-840; 145-693-014-792-954; 149-065-448-470-82X; 149-255-225-240-75X; 149-796-004-088-960; 149-973-083-062-025; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 152-137-175-963-503; 155-395-601-295-319; 160-034-774-619-227; 162-442-188-512-684; 173-395-655-431-550,4

Robustifying many existing models such as the binary choice models, an algorithm is devised to provably recover an epsilon-accurate ranking with high probability while allowing as large as O(n) grossly corrupted comparison results per item.(Part-1b) Typically, items have associated features. Subsuming several models including the classic Bradley-Terry-Luce and Thurstone models, a feature-based low-rank model is proposed and characterized. In learning this model, the O(n log n) sorting barrier is provably improved upon due to the proposed sample-efficient polynomial time algorithm that systematically uses features and feature correlations. Via empirical benchmarking, it is shown that the proposed approach consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithms that do not use feature information.(2) Matrix factorization:(Part-2a) While principal component analysis and its variants are very well-studied, existing algorithms are either space-efficient or noise-tolerant; in contrast, incorporating both these aspects in solving eigen-problems, a space-efficient noise-tolerant algorithm with finite sample guarantees is developed and analyzed in the framework of the perturbed spiked covariance model under weaker assumptions than previous works; a key differentiating aspect from previous works is that the algorithm is streaming. Moreover, the derived computational and statistical guarantees are near optimal (up to logarithmic factors).(Part-2b) While robust subspace identification methods, both convex and non-convex, are well-studied, they are often oblivious to utilizing feature information that is available in practice; in contrast to existing (feature-oblivious) convex and non-convex approaches, a simple iterative method with a fast (linear) convergence property is proposed and studied - a key aspect that differentiates this from previous works is how side information is incorporated in achieving better robust subspace recovery.",,,,,Sorting; Algorithm; Iterative method; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Time complexity; Subspace topology; Mathematics; Matrix decomposition; Theoretical computer science; Learning to rank,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6r12m6qr,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6r12m6qr,,,2581504556,,0,,0

Eu Case Study,2020-12-06,2020,,,,,,Desislava Dimitrova,"Innovation in terms of science and technological progress has been recognized by the vast majority of scholars as a key to economic development. In 2010 European commission proposed the strategy Europe 2020 for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and innovation plays the major role for its achievement. To track member states’ performance European Innovation Scoreboards (EIS) project is launched in 2011, which shows considerable differences in their innovation levels. Those differences are stable and cannot be explained within the framework of old-new members states, which gives us a reason to explore alternative paths. This paper suggests the thesis that culture could be viewed as a determinant of successful national-level innovation performance.

133-152-310-057-893,When Can Every Group Member be Above the Group's Average? The Weighted LOGE Theory of Social Comparison Biases,2020-07-18,2020,other,,,Center for Open Science,,Shir Etgar,"<p>The Non Selective Superiority bias (NSSB) is defined as the tendency to judge each randomly chosen group member from a positive group as better than the other group members from the same group. While this is a reliable and robust bias, its origins are still debated.  Internal explanations of the bias posit that NSSB is caused by some distortion in the internal comparisons between the focal group member and the other members of the same group. According to unique attribute theory (Chambers, 2010), NSSB occurs because each individual group member of a positive group is judged according to the dimension that positively distinguishes this individual member from the other members of the same positive group. According to focalism theories (e.g., Moore &amp;amp; Kim, 2003; Posavacet al., 2004), judges focus excessively on the standing of the focal member on the judged quality rather than the corresponding status of the others in the group on the same quality (i.e., ""this candidate is highly curious"" rather than ""this candidate is curious more than other candidates in the short list"").Giladi and Klar (2002) proposed an external explanation for the bias, meaning, suggested that the bias occurs due to a distortion that is not related to a comparison between the focal group members. Their approach, LOGE (Local comparisons- General Standards), suggested that in addition to the internal comparison between the judged group member and the others in the local group, a second, simultaneous comparison also takes place. This is a comparison between each judged group member and the general standard, which represents the judge's knowledge and experience about the range of qualities within the larger category that pertains to the judged local group. This external standard is logically irrelevant to the comparison process; however, cognitively, it cannot be avoided.  According to LOGE, NSSB is due to the intrusive effect of the external comparison with the general stand pertaining to the judged quality.  The original LOGE theory paid no special attention to the relative judgmental weights of the two components (i.e., internal and external; DIFFL and DIFFG) in the resulting comparative judgment. Therefore, it was impossible to draw experimental predictions from the original theory. This dissertation attempts to rectify this issue. This work proposed a better specified version of LOGE which is termed Weighted-LOGE (W-LOGE).  In this version, the relative weights of DIFFL and DIFFG can vary.  This enables me to test the main LOGE prediction: the greater the judgmental focus is ascribed to DIFFG (rather than to DIFFL), the greater the comparative bias should be. This prediction suggests that when the focus is on the internal commonalities (rather than differences) within the local group, judges are likely to be less preoccupied with within-group comparisons (i.e., DIFFL) and consequently, will be engaged to a greater extent in the external comparison (i.e., DIFFG). W-LOGE will predict that in this case, a greater NSSB will occur.  In the first empirical section, we compared this prediction to unique attribute theory's predictions, Across three studies, we found support to the W-LOGE predictions, suggesting that NSSB increasing when group members are similar to each other. The next empirical section compared between W-LOGE and Focalism. This section employed a sequential comparative judgment method, in which each group member was judged in turn against the others in the group.  Focalism approaches argued that the origin of NSSB is the neglect of the non-focal group members during the comparative judgment. Therefore, when the focal member role alternates in each comparative judgment from one group member to another, Focalism assume that NSSB should progressively diminish or even totally disappear. Here as well, across three studies, evidence supported W-LOGE theory.In the final experimental section of this work, the sequential method used to directly contrast W-LOGE with both Focalism and unique attribute approaches. If judges repeatedly consider how superior each local group member is compared to the general standard, as seen at the previous section, what will happen when they additionally focus on within-group similarities? W-LOGE predicts that when the focus is on within-group similarities, the pluses of each of the local group members versus the general standards might even bolster the judgments and thus NSSB could even gradually increase with successive judgments. Across three additional study, this prediction was supported.  Across these nine studies, which utilized the W-LOGE model, I found support to the experimental predictions draw from the LOGE theory. These studies corroborate the claim that the logically irrelevant comparison of judged group members with an irrelevant general standard is the main cause of NSSB, since the relative judgmental weight assigned to this external comparison regulates the magnitude of the bias.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vb96p,,10.31234/osf.io/vb96p,,,0,,0
133-208-059-025-735,Online moderation of external assessment using Pairwise Judgements,2016-08-09,2016,,,,,,Christopher P Newhouse; Pina Tarricone,"When an assessment involves judgement by more than one assessor, it is usual to consider that some form of moderation is required to ensure consistent results. This often involves face-to-face meetings to compare judgements, and agree upon a score or grade. As well as inconsistency between assessors there is typically substantial error due to inconsistency in judgement between student performances by individual assessors. This is particularly the case where judgements are necessarily highly subjective. The traditional forms of moderation tend to be logistically difficult and analytical scoring using devices such as rubrics make generating reliable scores difficult. It is likely that problems such as these can be tackled using modern technologies, a thesis that we set out to investigate in the final phase of a three-year project into summative assessment in senior secondary schooling.  The study investigated the use of digital technologies to support a form of social online moderation, which involved the use of digital communications and assessment tools to facilitate a pairwise comparative judgement approach. It involved a small group of Visual Arts teachers from rural schools in Western Australia assessing digitised forms of artworks submitted for high-stakes summative assessment at the end of Year 12. The aim was to determine whether the use of these technologies would provide good moderation outcomes and valuable professional learning for those involved. The participants were guided through the processes that involved no face-to-face meetings and were questioned about their experiences of these processes and technologies, and their attitudes and perceptions of them. In addition the scores from their judgements were analysed. The results demonstrated that it was feasible to use these technologies to support moderation processes under these circumstances. Further participants perceived that the social online moderation processes supported by the technologies had assisted them in making more consistent judgements and increasing their understanding of the standards of work submitted and the application of the assessment criteria. They found the comparative judgement approach easy to use and appropriate for assessing the highly subjective artworks. However, the study found that probably due to the inexperience of some of the assessors the reliability of the final scores was not as high as anticipated. As a result a slightly more rigorous method for social online moderation is recommended by the study.",,,,,Rubric; Summative assessment; Psychology; Professional learning community; Pairwise comparison; Perception; Judgement; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Moderation,,,,,http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4022&context=ecuworkspost2013 https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/3016/ https://works.bepress.com/pina_tarricone/24/,https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/3016/,,,2467648677,,0,013-478-726-487-335; 015-818-297-478-879; 027-259-331-943-947; 048-091-210-665-560; 097-276-124-595-664; 155-610-667-713-754; 163-379-589-157-078,0

Hendrickx; Alex Olshevsky; Venkatesh Saligrama,"We consider the problem of learning the qualities of a collection of items by performing noisy comparisons among them. Following the standard paradigm, we assume there is a fixed ""comparison graph"" and every neighboring pair of items in this graph is compared $k$ times according to the Bradley-Terry-Luce model (where the probability than an item wins a comparison is proportional the item quality). We are interested in how the relative error in quality estimation scales with the comparison graph in the regime where $k$ is large. We prove that, after a known transition period, the relevant graph-theoretic quantity is the square root of the resistance of the comparison graph. Specifically, we provide an algorithm that is minimax optimal. The algorithm has a relative error decay that scales with the square root of the graph resistance, and provide a matching lower bound (up to log factors). The performance guarantee of our algorithm, both in terms of the graph and the skewness of the item quality distribution, outperforms earlier results.",,,,,Square root; Discrete mathematics; Skewness; Approximation error; Graph; Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Item quality; Computer science; Upper and lower bounds,,,,,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00141 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00141v1 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1902.00141 http://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00141,https://arxiv.org/pdf/1902.00141,,,2913839581,,0,016-390-369-973-732; 023-172-374-447-989; 027-896-243-015-499; 032-718-506-620-930; 039-230-411-215-161; 047-307-839-107-965; 053-013-800-478-068; 057-266-462-065-914; 067-525-597-395-757; 067-762-546-777-826; 067-860-359-894-241; 069-596-283-362-865; 069-786-299-886-556; 071-291-385-477-211; 072-843-415-820-973; 075-539-693-388-757; 084-277-702-104-998; 087-991-691-200-809; 092-198-976-262-277; 092-474-419-202-077; 094-222-344-008-721; 094-758-003-236-481; 097-643-643-342-898; 098-895-337-186-636; 107-262-823-489-661; 134-439-485-894-444; 137-940-671-974-155; 155-729-366-689-349; 178-422-975-780-285; 189-604-438-235-720,1

Comparative judgement requires no rubrics and is instead grounded in experts making pairwise judgements about the relative ‘quality’ of students’ work according to a high level criterion. The resulting decision data are fitted to a statistical model to produce a score for each student. Cited benefits of comparative judgement over traditional methods include increased reliability, validity and efficiency of assessment processes. We investigated whether such claims apply to summative statistics and English assessments in New Zealand.

Wiley,Abstract This paper examines the use of Choice Based Conjoint experimentation for forecasting demand for a new restaurant category. The results of the forecasting experiment are compared to demand for existing restaurant categories to determine whether the choice experiment replicates actual category shares in the sampled region. The analysis shows that Choice Based Conjoint experiments are able to predict category shares for existing restaurant categories. It is then shown how the approach may be used to estimate demand for a new category.,6,3,63,78,Market segmentation; Economics; Marketing; Microeconomics; Demand forecasting; Choice based conjoint; Conjoint analysis,,,,,http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30073874/dubelaar-applyingchoice-2001.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013055130 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J038v06n03_05 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20013055130.html http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30073874 http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1300/J038v06n03_05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j038v06n03_05,,10.1300/j038v06n03_05,2161217282,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 003-341-906-053-921; 003-939-760-735-714; 017-732-979-943-710; 022-622-766-755-111; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-514-360-551-987; 050-943-988-713-681; 053-721-445-397-227; 057-657-809-679-383; 059-665-470-130-801; 076-743-222-996-152; 092-474-419-202-077; 104-254-290-802-635; 104-299-174-213-795; 114-685-371-109-418; 126-228-529-644-878; 163-825-847-404-551; 166-420-281-978-911; 194-756-375-036-196,1

Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) agree on training system design goals; however, there is a lack of consensus on the relative order and magnitude of the priorities of each goal. The designs and implementations to achieve each goal have several interdependencies and tradeoffs, which require a comparison between different sets of design goals. A survey of pairwise comparisons was distributed to SMEs and two methods (a simple method and the Bradley-Terry model) were used to develop a unidimensional scale of prioritizations for each design goal. There was agreement in results across the simple method (calculating the proportion of times an alternative was chosen as preferable) and the Bradley-Terry model. The Bradley-Terry method offered a means to calculate measures of uncertainty, showing nuances where scores may overlap. This prioritization method enabled the research and development team to reconcile differing SME opinions. This also allowed for informed design decisions to ensure that the training system met expectations of SMEs and end users. Future efforts will involve developing scores for relevant sets of demographics to determine if there is concurrence and dissent in priorities. </jats:p>",62,1,1648,1652,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Computer science,,,,,http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1541931218621374,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1541931218621374,,10.1177/1541931218621374,2893586211,,0,011-797-116-120-363; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-303-310-378-01X; 025-009-658-071-875; 035-776-610-863-582; 083-231-400-366-060; 175-755-079-554-999; 183-914-972-982-465; 195-564-794-414-606,1

Solar energy has been used in different forms for a long time. Concentrators of solar radiation can be used to produce unlimited, clean and free energy and save fossil fuels considerably. One of important applications of solar energy is to manufacture solar wood drying units. Iran has been located in an appropriate situation in the world with respect to receiving solar energy. The aim of the present paper is to propose a multicriteria methodological approach based on Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) useful for the “Determination of Effective Criteria on Site Selection for Solar Wood Drying Units in Iran”. The methodological approach is divided in 3 steps. In first step experts of kiln wood drying were interviewed for preliminary investigation. In the second step, hierarchy of criteria was designed and weighing values of them were calculated by Analytic Hierarchy Process. Finally, in the third step, model was used rating for prioritizing capable provinces. Results showed that Qom province, with average temperature, has the highest priority as a criterion and alternative.",8,,378,386,Wood drying; Kiln; Process engineering; Energy supply; Site selection; Hierarchy; Environmental science; Solar energy; Fossil fuel; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S221078431630033X https://core.ac.uk/display/82095804 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82095804.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aaspro.2016.02.033,,10.1016/j.aaspro.2016.02.033,2329788749,,0,003-679-250-169-54X; 015-093-318-444-286; 036-784-682-767-502; 060-707-721-945-086; 061-759-790-590-195; 067-341-125-020-782; 082-008-221-758-749; 118-644-671-559-044; 131-593-484-837-401; 142-495-764-394-377; 154-556-244-657-593; 164-774-753-245-94X; 167-686-530-456-845; 197-480-806-867-501,3

Herder; François Clemens,"Decision-making for sewer asset management is partially based on intuition and often lacks explicit argumentation, hampering decision transparency and reproducibility. It is unknown to what extent each information source is appreciated by decision makers. Further insight into this relative importance and into implicit factors, improves understanding of decision-making of sewer system managers. As such, a digital questionnaire (response ratio 43%), containing pairwise comparisons between ten relevant information sources, was sent to every municipality in the Netherlands to analyse the relative importance and assess whether a shared frame of reasoning is present. Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment was used for analysis, combined with several consistency tests. Results show that camera inspections were valued highest, while pipe age was considered least important. The respondents were pretty consistent per individual and also showed consistency as a group. This indicated a common framework of reasoning among the group. The feedback of the group showed, however, the respondents found it difficult to make general comparisons without having a context. This indicates decision-making in practice is more likely to be steered by other mechanisms than purely combining information sources.",,,,,Engineering; Thurstone scale; Law of comparative judgment; Pairwise comparison; Data science; Asset management; Common framework; Management science; Argumentation theory; Transparency (graphic); Value of information,,,,,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:56a2e0a9-3bd4-4c3d-a2c9-ad48aba6d39c https://repository.tudelft.nl/view/ir/uuid:56a2e0a9-3bd4-4c3d-a2c9-ad48aba6d39c/ https://repository.tudelft.nl/islandora/object/uuid%3A56a2e0a9-3bd4-4c3d-a2c9-ad48aba6d39c/datastream/OBJ/download,http://resolver.tudelft.nl/uuid:56a2e0a9-3bd4-4c3d-a2c9-ad48aba6d39c,,,2161182718,,0,,0

Specifically, the larger the reference group, the more polarized the behavior it prompted. In situations describing social loss, participants were led to make riskier decisions after comparing themselves against larger groups, while in situations describing social gain, they become more risk averse.

Yellott,"Luce's Choice Axiom (LCA) is a hypothesis about probabilistic choice behavior (leading to a mathematical model) due to R. D. Luce. It envisions a situation in which an individual makes repeated choices from a set A containing N alternatives: A={a1, …, aN} (e.g., N restaurants). On each occasion exactly one alternative is selected. Sometimes all N alternatives are available for selection (all the restaurants are open); on other occasions only subsets of A are available (some restaurants are closed). P(i; A) denotes the probability that ai is chosen when all of A is available; P(i; S) is the probability that ai is chosen when the available set of alternatives is S⊆A. What is the relationship between P(i; S) and P(i; A)? LCA is the assumption that P(i; S) equals the conditional probability that ai is chosen from the full set A, given that the choice from A belongs to subset S. The article deals with: (a) testable predictions of LCA (e.g., the constant ratio rule: for all i≠j and S⊆A, P(i; S)/P(j; S)=P(i; A)/P(j; A)), (b) the empirical validity of LCA, (c) relationships between LCA and other models for choice behavior: Thurstone's ‘Law of Comparative Judgement,’ Tversky's ‘Choice by Elimination’ model, McFadden's ‘Multinomial Logit’ and ‘Generalized Extreme Value’ models, and (d) extension of LCA to preferences expressed by rank ordering.",,,9094,9097,Multinomial logistic regression; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Axiom; Generalized extreme value distribution; Judgement; Luce's choice axiom; Mathematics; Conditional probability; Probabilistic logic,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/02b7s10w https://escholarship.org/uc/item/02b7s10w.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767006306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b0-08-043076-7/00630-6,,10.1016/b0-08-043076-7/00630-6,1941560889,,0,034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-310-338-398-932; 091-357-777-231-24X; 095-720-759-868-465; 111-358-495-245-06X,2

Shepperd; Marie Helweg-Larsen; Ligia Ortega,"Research reveals pervasive optimism in people's comparative risk judgments such that people believe they are less likely than others to experience negative events. Two studies explored the extent to which people are consistent in their comparative risk judgments across time and events. Both studies found strong evidence for consistency across time and some evidence for consistency across events. The consistency across time and events was moderated by experience. Specifically, when viewed together, the studies suggest that experience produces an initial decrease in the consistency of comparative judgments (Study 2), followed by greater consistency in subsequent judgments (Study 1). The discussion focuses on reconciling evidence demonstrating consistency with evidence demonstrating variability.",29,9,1169,1180,Psychology; Optimism; Social psychology,,Adolescent; Adult; Attitude; Female; Humans; Judgment; Life Change Events; Male; Middle Aged; Risk Factors,,,http://www.psych.ufl.edu/~shepperd/articles/stability.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167203254598 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/15198085 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0146167203254598 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15198085 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Marie_Helweg-Larsen/publication/8509660_Are_comparative_risk_judgements_consistent_across_time_and_events/links/02bfe50d20962b65de000000.pdf https://scholar.dickinson.edu/faculty_publications/972/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0146167203254598,15198085,10.1177/0146167203254598,2015915696,,0,001-539-529-845-798; 001-886-186-828-027; 004-949-838-366-871; 009-063-330-259-310; 011-397-141-989-21X; 014-035-685-925-91X; 014-250-530-986-293; 020-419-379-272-121; 024-838-013-412-523; 025-736-055-916-542; 027-186-789-368-775; 032-068-539-053-790; 033-145-626-985-847; 035-442-585-497-153; 039-011-812-170-670; 040-269-259-341-705; 048-516-227-339-009; 049-229-125-635-709; 054-163-434-118-897; 054-838-615-271-826; 054-966-158-757-869; 056-426-293-128-753; 059-428-622-508-721; 060-138-466-652-413; 061-225-608-336-38X; 061-624-680-750-903; 071-452-830-825-857; 071-615-171-268-332; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-876-017-414-92X; 074-062-617-545-851; 076-391-942-699-520; 085-882-498-659-946; 092-534-364-737-788; 100-971-221-141-630; 103-246-940-710-411; 107-854-421-865-889; 109-068-553-916-259; 111-691-221-738-333; 129-819-415-897-379; 134-106-001-898-882; 134-549-916-860-252; 135-231-853-698-302; 135-475-105-545-141; 151-785-680-144-305; 158-444-232-588-710; 179-844-522-808-528; 181-166-614-027-51X; 187-632-544-533-364,68

In most settings, in addition to obtaining ranking, finding 'scores' for each object (e.g. player's rating) is of interest to understanding the intensity of the preferences.; ; In this paper, we propose a novel iterative rank aggregation algorithm for discovering scores for objects from pairwise comparisons. The algorithm has a natural random walk interpretation over the graph of objects with edges present between two objects if they are compared; the scores turn out to be the stationary probability of this random walk. The algorithm is model independent. To establish the efficacy of our method, however, we consider the popular Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model in which each object has an associated score which determines the probabilistic outcomes of pairwise comparisons between objects. We bound the finite sample error rates between the scores assumed by the BTL model and those estimated by our algorithm. This, in essence, leads to order-optimal dependence on the number of samples required to learn the scores well by our algorithm. Indeed, the experimental evaluation shows that our (model independent) algorithm performs as well as the Maximum Likelihood Estimator of the BTL model and outperforms a recently proposed algorithm by Ammar and Shah [1].",25,,2474,2482,Algorithm; Machine learning; Random walk; Graph; Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; TrueSkill; Pair wise; Mathematics; Probabilistic logic; Stationary distribution,,,,,https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4701-iterative-ranking-from-pair-wise-comparisons.pdf https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/4701-iterative-ranking-from-pair-wise-comparisons https://papers.nips.cc/paper/4701-iterative-ranking-from-pair-wise-comparisons https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/iterative-ranking-from-pair-wise-comparisons https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/nips/nips2012.html#NegahbanOS12 https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/2012/file/9adeb82fffb5444e81fa0ce8ad8afe7a-Paper.pdf,https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper/4701-iterative-ranking-from-pair-wise-comparisons,,,2098649057,,0,009-316-589-031-043; 010-136-645-510-231; 011-105-391-999-886; 013-292-948-155-939; 016-104-565-430-858; 025-192-553-715-150; 043-670-394-152-632; 052-209-553-791-396; 054-013-791-330-77X; 057-657-809-679-383; 061-295-142-491-102; 079-877-406-165-903; 087-991-691-200-809; 094-122-647-467-249; 105-628-862-061-546; 108-042-805-756-051; 116-275-534-296-096; 136-510-755-969-787; 155-402-052-450-031; 161-247-307-055-667; 161-387-482-708-551,142
137-959-770-636-055,Comparative judgment and proof,2020-06-19,2020,dissertation,,,,,Ben Davies,"Proof is a central concept in mathematics, pivotal both to the practice of mathematicians and to students’ education in the discipline. The research community, however, has failed to reach a consensus on how proof should be conceptualised.Moreover, we know little of what mathematicians and students think about proof, and are limited in the tools we use to assess students’ understanding.This thesis introduces comparative judgment to the proof literature via two tasks evaluated by judges performing a series of pairwise comparisons. The Conceptions Task asks for a written explanation of what mathematicians meanby proof. The Summary Task asks for a summary of a given proof, available to respondents as they complete the task.Having established robust evidence supporting the reliability and validity of both tasks, I then use these tasks to develop an understanding of the conceptions of proof held by mathematicians and students. I also generate insights forassessment, leading to an argument for the unidimensionality of proof comprehension in early undergraduate mathematics.In conducting this research I adopt a mixed methods approach based on the philosophy of pragmatism. By using a range of methodological approaches, from statistical modelling to thematic analysis of interviews with judges, I develop amulti-faceted understanding of both the validity of the tasks, and the behaviours and priorities of the participants involved.The Conceptions Task outcomes establish that mathematicians primarily think of proof in terms of argumentation, while students emphasise the arguablymore philosophically naive notion of certainty.The Summary Task outcomes establish that references to the method of proof and key mathematical objects are most valued by mathematician judges. Further, from correlational analyses of various quantitative measures, I learn that the Summary Task scores are meaningfully reflective of local proof comprehension but are not related to more general measures of mathematical performance.Several open questions are identified. In particular, there is still much to learn about judges’ decision-making processes in comparative judgment settings, the dimensionality of proof comprehension, and the range of proofs for which the Summary Task is applicable. Future work on these questions is outlined in the final chapter, alongside the practical applications and theoretical implications of this work.",,,,,Mathematical proof; Statistical model; Mathematics education; Pragmatism; Pairwise comparison; Research community; Comprehension; Argumentation theory; Thematic analysis,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Comparative_judgment_and_proof/11638317/1 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Comparative_judgment_and_proof/11638317 https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.808054,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/thesis/Comparative_judgment_and_proof/11638317,,,3036841275,,0,,0

These assessment efforts typically focus on measuring learning rather than stimulating, promoting, or producing learning in students. This paper summarizes a study of a large sample of undergraduate students (n = 550) in an entry-level design-thinking course who engaged with Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ), a form of assessment, as a learning mechanism. Following random assignment into control and treatment sections, students engaged in identical activities with the exception of a 20-minute intervention we call learning by evaluating (LbE). Prior to engaging in a Point Of View (POV) creation activity, treatment group students engaged in LbE by viewing pairs of previously-collected POV statements through ACJ; in each case they viewed two POV statements side-by-side and selected the POV statement they believed was better. Following this experience, students created their own POV statements and then the final POV statements, from both the control and treatment students, were collected and evaluated by instructors using ACJ. In addition, qualitative data consisting of student comments, collected during ACJ comparisons, were coded by the researchers to further explore the potential for the students to use class knowledge while engaging in the LbE review of peer work. Both the quantitative and qualitative data sets were analyzed to investigate the impact of the LbE activity. Consistent with other ACJ research findings, significant positive learning gains were found for students who engaged in the intervention. Researchers also noted that these findings did not indicate the actual quality of the assignments, meaning the while students who engaged in the LbE intervention were better than their peers, they were not necessarily “good” at the assignment themselves.

The Offa water works is studied with the model so as to assist its future operation and the design of alternative system improvement works. AHP, a technique used in Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) had made important contribution to the practical decision making process by recognizing the decision makers (DMs) experience and in providing the possible best compromised solution in terms of multiple objectives and multiples DMs and stakeholders preferences. The study introduces three management options that are formulated on the prevailing nation’s water supply sector and foreign countries models. The three options are respectively: Public Ownership and Operation; Public Ownership and Private Operation; and Private Ownership and Operation. The stakeholders have chosen option 1 (Public Ownership and Operation) as most contributing to sustainable operation of an urban water supply service delivery under scrutiny of environmental, economical, technical, institutional, and socio-cultural criteria. The choice of option 1 reaffirms the stakeholder opinion in the survey that they did not want government to abandon their responsibility in the water sector. The ranking of the choice is based on the compromise solutions according to the performance of the system under various alternatives that are considered and the preference of the decision makers (DMs) or stakeholders on Performance Indicators or Measures (PIs or PMs). Subsequently, the AHP framework is more valuable and effective in facilitating an explorative insight into the problem.",24,1,19,24,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Decision-making; Environmental economics; Performance indicator; Business; Government; Stakeholder; Management science; Service delivery framework; Analytic hierarchy process; Water supply,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/B_Sule/publication/257451256_Evaluation_of_management_alternatives_for_urban_water_supply_system_using_Multicriteria_Decision_Analysis/links/55c3627d08aeb975673f0b15.pdf?origin=publication_list https://core.ac.uk/display/82805139 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018363911000614 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82805139.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jksues.2011.07.004,,10.1016/j.jksues.2011.07.004,1991613310,,0,007-882-319-771-256; 017-567-746-541-001; 024-759-467-275-062; 036-228-300-327-150; 043-294-249-724-191; 062-918-551-069-388; 090-090-921-634-435; 091-044-846-799-895; 109-322-602-752-803; 129-079-639-740-695; 166-741-898-052-139; 179-934-687-055-666,33

The AHP was used to evaluate the effectiveness of camouflage patterns printed on fabric. The camouflage uniforms were presented to a panel of observers two at a time. The observers scored the effectiveness according to a scale provided. This data was then used to calculate the relative effectiveness values in order to rank the patterns from the best to the worst performer.

Wyer Jr,"Consumers who compare products may often ignore features that the choice alternatives have in common. As a result, they often evaluate products more favorably when the products have unique positive features but common negative features than when they have unique negative features but common positive ones. Two studies examined contingencies in the occurrence of these ""cancellation"" effects and explored their implications for people's evaluations of not only the products being compared but other products they encounter subsequently. Some participants were explicitly told to compare two products at the time they received information about them. They not only disregarded the products' common features when initially evaluating these products, but disregarded evaluatively similar features of a third product they encountered some time later. Other participants were initially told to describe each product separately. In this condition, they formed an overall impression of each product individually, and so cancellation effects were not apparent. Nevertheless, their preference for one product over the other was based on a comparison of the products' individual features that they could recall at the time of judgment rather than on the global impressions they had formed when the product information was first presented",12,4,327,340,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1207/15327660260382360,,10.1207/15327660260382360,,,0,,16

However, this design is impractical in many situations, especially in online auction environments where consumers cannot be asked to make comparisons before they make estimates. This study suggests and validates an alternative experimental design where no comparison process is needed to induce anchoring bias. Moreover, we postulate that repeated occurrence of anchoring points affect the strength of the anchoring effect on participants' price estimates. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the anchoring effect in both two-stage and one-stage designs. The results showed that the anchoring effect was robust under two-stage design, and repeated occurrence of the anchor did not reinforce the anchoring effect. Moreover, people's price estimates are susceptible to the anchoring effect even when they were not asked to make a comparative judgement before they determine the final estimate. However, the anchoring effect can be further consolidated when the anchor appears three times rather than once. Experimental design introduced in study 2 provides a promising website design direction and we suggest that high anchors should be embedded in a web page repeatedly to influence the buyers' value estimates to produce a premium.",27,1,31,42,Human–computer interaction; Engineering; World Wide Web; Information system; Anchoring; Web page; Judgement; Website design; Laboratory experiment; Online auction; E-commerce,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1080/01449290600874998 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/behaviourIT/behaviourIT27.html#WuCL08 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01449290600874998 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1451114 https://doi.org/10.1080/01449290600874998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01449290600874998,,10.1080/01449290600874998,2038886144,,0,005-553-153-856-945; 005-647-092-865-887; 014-991-755-969-177; 021-643-430-658-55X; 023-005-452-624-875; 029-207-492-909-748; 038-189-190-630-223; 057-561-524-688-298; 063-793-155-762-965; 067-869-375-985-814; 068-785-424-765-913; 085-271-493-217-441; 090-060-639-887-992; 099-080-524-853-608; 105-638-537-991-116; 111-347-097-082-548; 117-150-305-299-565; 124-538-751-952-258; 129-448-954-957-81X; 130-971-600-994-543; 132-914-230-472-749; 134-875-956-046-363; 147-470-185-440-763; 148-223-435-969-407; 153-673-590-545-62X,15

Suppose a collection of items is compared in pairs repeatedly, and we aim to recover a consistent ordering that focuses on the top-$K$ ranked items based on partially revealed preference information. We investigate the Bradley-Terry-Luce model in which one ranks items according to their perceived utilities modeled as noisy observations of their underlying true utilities. Our main contributions are two-fold. First, in a general comparison model where item pairs to compare are given a priori, we attain an upper and lower bound on the sample size for reliable recovery of the top-$K$ ranked items. Second, more importantly, extending the result to a random comparison model where item pairs to compare are chosen independently with some probability, we show that in slightly restricted regimes, the gap between the derived bounds reduces to a constant factor, hence reveals that a spectral method can achieve the minimax optimality on the (order-wise) sample size required for top-$K$ ranking. That is to say, we demonstrate a spectral method alone to be sufficient to achieve the optimality and advantageous in terms of computational complexity, as it does not require an additional stage of maximum likelihood estimation that a state-of-the-art scheme employs to achieve the optimality.

According to the World Health Organization, people are categorised as having osteoporosis when their bone mineral density (BMD) value is 2.5 standard deviation (SD) below the young adult mean value, and as having osteopenia when the value lies between one and 2.5 SDs below the young adult mean value. The categorisation according to SDs makes osteoporosis a rather unique case within the medical world of risk definitions. We invited women who had their bone mass scanned in the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) to participate in focus groups and share their scanning experiences. Nine groups of women met three times for a total of 27 focus group discussions.

Motivating students to explore and establish what is of value in their subject domain is a significant challenge facing academics and practitioners alike. Williams (2009) presents design based technology education as being embedded in the personal and social context of the student, where the value of what is being learned is as important as the content itself. Design based tasks have the potential to encourage students to establish and make explicit their views and beliefs. Requiring students to establish their own assessment criteria introduces uncertainty, risk, and confusion into the process of learning. Establishing what is of value now becomes the primary concern for the learner in a quest to demonstrate their capability within a personal view of the subject domain. This study implemented a constructivist approach to learning in a design based task focused on the development of design, craft and processing skills. The method employed a peer assessment strategy through the use of an Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) model of assessment that required students to democratically assess the work of their peers. Assessment criteria were not made explicit, as students were encouraged to present their own conception of capability developed throughout the learning activity. The significance of the study was highlighted by the reaction of the students to their dual role as learner and assessor and how this affected their learning. The empirical evidence collected highlights the importance of empathy as a mediator when developing critical reflective practise. The study outlines the cultural impact of democratic peer assessment on initial teacher education students while establishing what to value within their subject domain.",,073,119,125,Mathematics education; Empirical evidence; Political science; Adaptive comparative judgement; Constructivist teaching methods; Craft; Empathy; Teacher education; Peer assessment; Technology education,,,,,https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/073/014/ecp12073014.pdf https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=073;article=014,https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=073;article=014,,,2289784600,,0,002-081-620-058-378; 003-019-903-218-043; 010-084-583-635-941; 030-886-013-118-037; 046-440-857-440-08X; 060-586-982-949-626; 063-199-705-126-655; 071-837-551-305-725; 098-490-797-549-316; 114-331-251-470-403; 115-862-167-238-600; 120-588-342-597-419; 127-553-827-929-797; 128-554-891-964-037; 168-704-895-296-891; 182-654-317-262-088,2

To date, studies on the return trip effect have failed to confirm its existence in a situation that is ecologically valid in terms of environment and duration. In addition, physiological influences as part of fundamental timing mechanisms in daily activities have not been investigated in the time perception literature. The present study compared round-trip and non-round-trip conditions in an ecological situation. Time estimation in real time and postdictive estimation were used to clarify the situations where the return trip effect occurs. Autonomic nervous system activity was evaluated from the electrocardiogram using the Lorenz plot to demonstrate the relationship between time perception and physiological indices. The results suggest that the return trip effect is caused only postdictively. Electrocardiographic analysis revealed that the two experimental conditions induced different responses in the autonomic nervous system, particularly in sympathetic nervous function, and that parasympathetic function correlated with postdictive timing. To account for the main findings, the discrepancy between the two time estimates is discussed in the light of timing strategies, i.e., prospective and retrospective timing, which reflect different emphasis on attention and memory processes. Also each timing method, i.e., the verbal estimation, production or comparative judgment, has different characteristics such as the quantification of duration in time units or knowledge of the target duration, which may be responsible for the discrepancy.

Srikant; Laurent Massoulié; Marc Lelarge; Bruce Hajek,"Given a set of pairwise comparisons, the classical ranking problem computes a single ranking that best represents the preferences of all users. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring individual preferences, arising in the context of making personalized recommendations. In particular, we assume users form clusters; users of the same cluster provide similar pairwise comparisons for the items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We propose an efficient algorithm to estimate the preference for each user: first, compute the net-win vector for each user using the comparisons; second, cluster the users based on the net-win vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. We show that the net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of pairwise comparisons, therefore our algorithm can cluster the users reliably. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the Bradley-Terry model is still close to the true preference.",43,1,449,450,Machine learning; Data mining; Cluster (physics); Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Inference; Bradley–Terry model; Efficient algorithm; High dimensional; Computer science; Cluster analysis,,,,AFOSR,https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2745844.2745887 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=2796314.2745887 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/sigmetrics/sigmetrics2015.html#WuXSMLH15 https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01226785 https://experts.illinois.edu/en/publications/clustering-and-inference-from-pairwise-comparisons https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150204631W/abstract https://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2745844.2745887,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2745844.2745887,,10.1145/2745844.2745887,2165836430,,0,001-004-209-528-581; 001-571-051-609-613; 004-848-515-510-16X; 009-316-589-031-043; 010-132-302-334-522; 011-105-391-999-886; 011-504-965-300-586; 017-081-732-842-09X; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-308-857-235-636; 032-718-506-620-930; 034-175-000-996-02X; 067-860-359-894-241; 074-486-502-272-485; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 092-798-854-976-238; 094-222-344-008-721; 096-979-791-156-213; 099-292-161-810-493; 109-668-006-494-690; 116-610-520-777-687; 125-667-490-657-695; 126-236-373-059-890; 141-412-401-328-220; 161-247-307-055-667; 168-838-973-937-775; 172-520-776-223-903; 199-987-294-560-607,8

Using the “law of comparative judgments,” over 300 graduate-level education students reviewed one pair of portfolios and made independent evaluations as to which of the two states’ portfolios reflected a greater degree of accountability pressure. Participants’ judgments yielded a matrix that was converted into a single rating system that arranged all 25 states on a continuum of accountability “pressure” from high to low.

Standardized assessment is inappropriate for children from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. There are research findings that are supportive of the cultural dependency of cognition, language, and personality. It is inconceivable that an assessment measure can be reliable and valid if its conceptual foundation is faulty. Standardized tests rest on a flawed understanding of human development and behavior as it pertains to intelligence, language, academic achievement, and personality. The assessment practice of making comparative judgments among culturally distinct groups is premature because insufficient research attention has been given to the impact of cultural differences on the development and expression of behavior in these realms. More systematic research about these constructs is needed, particularly for children socialized beyond the pale of U.S. mainstream culture.",,,159,163,Cultural diversity; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Personality; Cross-cultural studies; Standardized test; Socialization; Mainstream; Academic achievement,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780122904516500143,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b978-012290451-6/50014-3,,10.1016/b978-012290451-6/50014-3,949947229,,0,,0

In this paper, we take a contrasting bottom-up approach. We begin with the physical measures provided by the Blind Source Separation Evaluation Toolkit (BSS Eval) and we then look for corresponding perceptual correlates. This approach is known as psychophysics and has the distinct advantage of leading to interpretable, psychophysical models. We obtained perceptual similarity judgments from listeners in two experiments featuring vocal sources within musical mixtures. In the first experiment, listeners compared the overall quality of vocal signals estimated from musical mixtures using a range of competing source separation methods. In a loudness experiment, listeners compared the loudness balance of the competing musical accompaniment and vocal.

147-244-265-213-055,Impact of Cognitive Demand on Vigilance Decrement: An Overview,2015-06-01,2015,journal article,Indian journal of positive psychology,,,,Anil Kumar Yadav; Indramani L. Singh; Trayambak Tiwari,"Vigilance refers to the ability of the individuals to maintain their focus of attention and to remain alert to stimuli over prolonged periods of time (Davies & Parasuraman, 1982; Parasuraman, 1986; Warm, 1984, 1993). The progressive decline in performance with time on vigilance task has been termed the decrement function (Dember & Warm, 1979) or the vigilance decrement (Davies & Parasuraman, 1982). Although vigilance research started long ago but interest in this area keeps mounting by the day. Vigilance is a phenomenon which attracts researchers not only for its practical implications in automation driven world but also because it provides an opportunity to understand almost all of the factors that may be considered to influence attention. Enthusiasm in vigilance research remains intact as human-machine interaction has evolved to new dimensions where human operator has become merely a passive observer waiting for critical signals that demand decision and action (Adams, Stenson, & Humes, 1961; Adams, 1963; Sheridan & Ferrell, 1974). Viewed in the context of an automation-oriented society, in which failures to detect critical signals can often be disastrous the problem of vigilance assumes considerable significance.Vigilance performance has been found to be related to a wide variety of factors. These include several psychophysical parameters like background event rate, sensory modality and signal conspicuity as well as several neurophysiological parameters as revealed through pupilary responses, EEG activity, blood catecholamines levels and the actions of pharmacological agents (Dember & Warm, 1979; Davies & Parasuraman, 1982; Beatty, 1982). In addition to these measures of vigilance performance, there are a number of studies that have shown that vigilance imposes high workload and is stressful (Warm, Parasuraman, & Matthews, 2008) and that the workload and stress of vigilance is moderated by the psychophysical properties of the task and the categories described in the taxonomy (Warm, Dember, & Hancock, 1996). Researchers have used various tasks in vigilance studies. These tasks can be presented in different sensory modalities and use different psychophysical dimensions to define critical signals. This led to a view that vigilance is not a unitary process, instead vigilance was considered to be task specific and controlled by the different processes in different tasks. To resolve this diversity in findings of vigilance research Parasuraman and Davies proposed attentional resource theory (Fisk & Scerbo, 1987; Fisk & Schneider, 1981; Kahneman, 1973; Wicken, 1984) as a framework. Resource model propagated that vigilance tasks arc highly demanding leading to depletion of information processing resources at a high rate which are not replenished in the time available. This leads to vigilance decrement. The more demand a task imposed on the observer, more is the depletion of resources.Cognitive demandVigilance tasks have traditionally been viewed as mentally undemanding and under stimulating. However, recent discoveries in vigilance research have proven that consideration to be wrong. It has been established through a number of studies that vigilance imposes high workload and is mentally demanding. Parasuraman (1979) proposed that vigilance tasks could be categorized by whether target detection required successive or simultaneous discrimination and that these tasks imposed differential demands on attentional resources. Successive tasks require absolute judgment in which observers need to compare current input with a standard retained in memory to separate target signals from non-target. Whereas, simultaneous tasks require comparative judgment in which all the information necessary to distinguish target stimuli from non-target stimuli is available in the stimuli itself. Successive tasks are more capacity demanding than simultaneous tasks due to involvement of distinct memory functions. …",6,2,215,218,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Vigilance (psychology); Stimulus modality; Workload; Blood catecholamines; Eeg activity; Social psychology; Information processing,,,,,http://www.i-scholar.in/index.php/ijpp/article/view/73852,http://www.i-scholar.in/index.php/ijpp/article/view/73852,,,2616178669,,0,,1

Uitdehaag; Antonio Criminisi; Abigail Sellen,"Background: Measurement instruments used in the neurological examination, including the Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS), cannot report small changes in patient performance that may be needed to evaluate the clinical course of neurological diseases and the efficacy of treatment. For a more reliable and sensitive assessment of disability in multiple sclerosis (MS) we are developing the ASSESS-MS system, which relies on the automated image analysis algorithm of defined recorded movements. To validate a more sensitive tool, a method to capture clinical judgement in a more discriminatory manner than ordinal scales is required. Therefore, we investigate the ability of experienced neurologists to evaluate motor dysfunction in MS patients via video-based paired comparisons. Objectives: To assess whether video-based paired comparisons of patient movements allow a reliable and finer-grained capture of clinical judgment of motor dysfunction in MS, than commonly used measurement instruments. Methods: Thirteen experienced neurologists were presented with pairs of video recordings of MS patients (EDSS 1-7) performing standardized movements like the finger nose test (FNT) and movements based on activities of daily living (ADL), such as drinking from a cup. The clinicians were asked to compare patients’ performance, evaluating as worse, equal or ‘judgement not possible, because of confounding factors’. The pairwise comparisons were evaluated and mapped onto a continuous scale using the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model, a commonly applied model in the analysis of paired comparison data. The results were analysed for intra- an interrater reliability and were correlated with the matching EDSS subscores. Results: The paired gradings were significantly correlated with the matching subscores (e.g. Kendall’s tau for FNT was 0.5 with p Conclusions: Paired comparisons of video-captured defined movements of MS patients appear to reliably capture neurological judgment of motor dysfunction. By providing finer-grained differentiation, gradings based on paired comparisons may serve as an improved external validation in the development of more sensitive (automated) outcome measures.",21,,,,Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Neurological examination; Multiple sclerosis; Expanded Disability Status Scale; Inter-rater reliability; Medicine; Confounding; Activities of daily living; Physical medicine and rehabilitation,,,,,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/video-based-paired-comparison-ranking-a-validation-tool-for-fine-grained-measurements-of-motor-dysfunction-in-multiple-sclerosis/,https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/video-based-paired-comparison-ranking-a-validation-tool-for-fine-grained-measurements-of-motor-dysfunction-in-multiple-sclerosis/,,,3016503692,,0,,0

Connecting teachers’ beliefs about teaching diverse learners to their noticing of inclusive classroom characteristics in videoclips,,2019,journal article,Contemporary Educational Psychology,0361476x; 10902384,Elsevier BV,United States,Iris Roose; Wendelien Vantieghem; Ruben Vanderlinde; Piet Van Avermaet,"Abstract Insight in the way teachers' beliefs filter their interpretation of inclusive classrooms is vital to support teachers’ competences to teach diverse learners. This study explores how three types of teacher beliefs about teaching diverse learners (i.e., professional beliefs about diversity, beliefs about differentiating the curriculum, and growth mindset) are associated with their noticing of two key aspects of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data was collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (N = 462) in Flemish schools (N = 23). Teacher beliefs were measured by survey scales, while teachers’ noticing of PTSI and DI was assessed by a standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument. Survey and video data were combined in a multivariate multilevel framework. Findings indicate that teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity and beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as filters for noticing PTSI and DI in videoclips. For teachers’ growth mindset no significant relationship was found. These associations did not change when taking into account teachers’ sex, age, educational background or experience. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers’ noticing DI is explained by the school level, suggesting that teachers within a school can share a vision. Results are discussed in the light of teacher thinking for inclusive classrooms and implications for teacher professional development.",56,,140,151,Competence (human resources); Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Judgement; Flemish; Mindset; Differentiated instruction; Curriculum; Professional development,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X18302807 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8588431,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002,,10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002,2907292383,,0,000-056-946-438-568; 001-130-814-749-478; 001-816-199-374-497; 003-188-947-757-126; 004-945-538-115-570; 005-925-916-359-467; 006-475-855-411-188; 007-008-789-576-294; 007-222-148-199-465; 007-238-613-398-889; 007-598-909-438-594; 007-605-631-008-014; 009-148-822-033-388; 009-631-573-859-890; 011-241-688-325-045; 012-460-221-586-897; 013-149-937-460-530; 014-178-357-512-399; 016-562-615-291-410; 019-466-517-214-63X; 020-037-705-548-725; 020-090-252-035-689; 020-410-993-470-16X; 023-076-111-489-079; 023-371-512-048-313; 025-970-561-198-85X; 028-780-018-707-570; 030-619-394-339-83X; 030-884-694-910-353; 032-182-993-297-073; 032-267-780-111-16X; 032-350-915-613-00X; 032-537-439-007-753; 034-308-442-497-566; 035-448-999-724-00X; 041-229-625-128-286; 043-543-260-262-498; 046-652-377-826-455; 047-503-393-805-643; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-238-801-487-157; 049-158-882-675-77X; 050-246-194-423-566; 053-527-559-301-001; 055-941-445-639-289; 056-856-051-276-163; 058-505-623-532-694; 058-605-022-037-864; 059-524-580-671-394; 061-635-915-999-601; 062-136-590-639-56X; 062-863-033-501-112; 066-657-378-420-21X; 069-929-829-230-278; 070-070-847-038-059; 070-118-044-620-088; 070-698-722-622-837; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-527-957-682-219; 079-561-893-442-216; 080-431-766-996-785; 081-990-827-471-155; 082-680-397-981-747; 087-996-569-717-41X; 090-297-325-685-656; 090-445-793-186-585; 091-513-087-045-089; 099-014-289-384-34X; 102-555-702-781-751; 103-241-685-940-304; 103-993-374-943-761; 105-948-724-703-144; 106-909-001-153-673; 118-658-396-717-120; 119-466-744-165-36X; 123-048-918-232-925; 125-606-263-553-977; 125-901-333-223-044; 127-659-660-814-933; 130-227-495-570-742; 132-079-116-330-337; 132-784-070-412-495; 132-882-893-998-203; 133-346-643-838-466; 135-089-625-164-101; 139-355-954-878-732; 140-843-764-687-773; 142-880-459-788-071; 142-987-562-942-313; 144-536-011-358-903; 149-973-083-062-025; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 160-677-556-841-005; 167-564-741-478-934; 172-413-910-758-148; 174-464-917-438-828; 181-201-084-615-795; 192-368-533-735-324; 199-247-058-966-679,6

They propose a method of using the pair comparison method and Thurstone's law of comparative judgment to construct a psychological information amount representing the psychological amount for which the shape of a 3D object is felt to be easy to perceive. The 3D object image entropy, which is a one-dimensional scale that is defined based on the number of visible surfaces in the 3D object image and the proportions of their surface areas, represents the amount of information that reflects the qualitative characteristic called aspect that the 3D object has and the quantitative characteristic called the proportion of the surface area. The authors limit the target objects to polyhedrons and measure the psychological information amount and 3D object image entropy for various types of shapes to examine the relationship between these kinds of information.

As the virtual objects do not exist in the real world, we do not directly consider their physical properties but instead compute the human-perceived softness of the geometric shapes. We collect crowdsourced data where humans rank their perception of the softness of vertex pairs on virtual 3D models. We then compute shape descriptors and use a learning-to-rank approach to learn a softness measure mapping any vertex to a softness value. Finally, we demonstrate our framework with a variety of 3D shapes.",,,65,68,Vertex (geometry); Artificial intelligence; Perception; 3D modeling; 3d shapes; 3d model; Computer vision; Computer science; Crowdsourcing; Geometric shape,,,,Microsoft Research; NSF,https://core.ac.uk/display/42416570 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/apgv/sap2016.html#LauDDR16 https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/80004 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42416570.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/2931002.2931019,,10.1145/2931002.2931019,2463222488,,0,002-527-684-947-055; 014-170-500-687-989; 014-657-974-539-413; 021-437-826-464-340; 022-830-311-479-399; 040-765-440-769-039; 042-769-782-052-549; 066-398-730-602-888; 073-806-031-687-214; 082-148-677-263-44X; 084-592-131-396-930; 089-607-348-430-07X; 091-826-835-244-858; 093-809-801-025-268; 107-044-967-361-944; 113-214-298-716-15X; 114-878-721-815-920; 116-666-521-119-97X; 125-119-982-166-983; 133-558-111-600-857; 160-333-081-418-107; 164-145-552-205-165; 196-118-563-396-136,1

Learning, memory, and cognition",19391285; 02787393,American Psychological Association Inc.,United States,Sharon Naparstek; Ziad Safadi; Limor Lichtenstein-Vidne; Avishai Henik,"The current research examined whether peripherally presented numerical information can affect the speed of number processing. In 2 experiments, participants were presented with a target matrix flanked by a distractor matrix and were asked to perform a comparative judgment (i.e., decide whether the target was larger or smaller than the reference 5). In Experiment 1, the target was symbolic (i.e., a single digit), and in Experiment 2, it was nonsymbolic (i.e., a random presentation of dots). In both experiments, flanker matrices had 2 dimensions-numerosity and numerical value-that were manipulated orthogonally to create stimulus congruent and stimulus incongruent conditions. Incongruent trials differed in the laterality between target and flanker (i.e., their location in relation to the reference 5). When responding to symbolic targets (Experiment 1), only the flanker's numerical value affected reaction times (RTs), whereas when responding to nonsymbolic targets (Experiment 2), only the flanker's numerosity affected RTs. In addition, the pattern of flanker interference differed between targets: For symbolic targets, laterality did not affect responses, whereas for nonsymbolic targets, laterality did affect responses. These results imply both symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitudes can be automatically activated; however, this activation is contingent upon their relevance to the task at hand. Implications of these results on the efficiency of the visual processing system and on numerical cognition are further discussed.",41,4,1262,1268,Association (psychology); Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Cognition; Laterality; Cognitive psychology; Visual processing; Selective attention; Numerical cognition; Social psychology,,"Attention; Cognition; Female; Humans; Male; Mathematical Concepts; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Psychological Tests; Reaction Time; Young Adult",,Israel Science Foundation; European Research Council,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25329083 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1067724,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/xlm0000067,25329083,10.1037/xlm0000067,2323095542,,0,,0

This work focuses on a particular learning scenario called label ranking, where the problem is to learn a mapping from instances to rankings over a finite number of labels. Our approach for learning such a mapping, called ranking by pairwise comparison (RPC), first induces a binary preference relation from suitable training data using a natural extension of pairwise classification. A ranking is then derived from the preference relation thus obtained by means of a ranking procedure, whereby different ranking methods can be used for minimizing different loss functions. In particular, we show that a simple (weighted) voting strategy minimizes risk with respect to the well-known Spearman rank correlation. We compare RPC to existing label ranking methods, which are based on scoring individual labels instead of comparing pairs of labels. Both empirically and theoretically, it is shown that RPC is superior in terms of computational efficiency, and at least competitive in terms of accuracy",172,16-17,1897,1916,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82061684.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.artint.2008.08.002,,10.1016/j.artint.2008.08.002,,,3,002-445-122-013-489; 009-782-305-202-815; 012-136-340-061-597; 014-703-690-282-366; 026-365-928-626-285; 037-011-373-945-135; 038-857-782-390-594; 042-428-178-144-986; 060-208-353-464-505; 064-090-245-779-280; 091-315-325-846-395; 100-762-118-457-919; 101-084-831-646-877; 109-307-053-458-98X; 126-124-284-309-29X; 159-422-950-997-446,224

It is for this reason that the Slavs have given it a great variety of names, the different use of which in philological publications heavily depends on the respective linguists’ connotative purposes (e.g., national and ideological interests and so forth). As a rule, the description of the language is based on the analysis of written or printed texts. Only recently have a few additional corpora been introduced in addition to the well-known group of “classical” Old Church Slavonic manuscripts, which, for all their merits in the history of Slavistics, can give only a vague idea of the rich language tradition of Church Slavonic as a whole, since, as a means of actual (oral) communication, it can nowadays be observed only in the liturgy. The article discusses the main linguistic conceptions applied to Church Slavonic in the past and present (root language, i.e., proto-language, common language, literary language [ Schriftsprache ], Ausbau language, etc.); singles out binaristic approaches in opposition to vernaculars; gives an overview of the numerous varieties to be differentiated within the language (connected to regions, chronology, functions, individuals, and groups); recalls the role of reconstruction in modern textbooks and the widely neglected construction devices used in early grammars and dictionaries; and, at the end, refers to the possibility of including Church Slavonic as a model for comparative judgments on degrees of diversity in the structural development of Slavonic languages.",6,1,8,75,Slavic languages; Art; Ideology; Philology; Opposition (planets); Liturgy; Old Church Slavonic; Literary language; Slavic studies; Linguistics,,,,,https://cyberleninka.ru/article/n/tserkovnoslavyanskiy-yazyk-krug-ponyatiy https://publications.hse.ru/mirror/pubs/share/direct/212151309.pdf https://publications.hse.ru/articles/211615998 http://slovene.ru/ojs/index.php/slovene/article/view/257,http://dx.doi.org/10.31168/2305-6754.2017.6.1.1,,10.31168/2305-6754.2017.6.1.1,2767670951,,0,012-544-787-842-165; 014-053-766-065-973; 017-588-543-742-850; 017-601-768-815-209; 021-644-012-954-473; 022-133-920-150-35X; 022-337-792-919-084; 024-454-793-533-55X; 030-391-475-676-637; 037-311-755-271-986; 037-807-603-857-602; 059-936-355-800-701; 063-935-792-862-935; 071-624-184-055-39X; 072-154-040-912-383; 073-320-275-938-104; 076-357-482-409-473; 076-627-534-361-879; 078-207-210-716-778; 083-982-336-749-928; 084-969-869-512-747; 087-505-587-984-408; 087-623-912-544-359; 090-740-469-743-716; 093-677-079-670-179; 094-717-288-126-76X; 112-417-183-766-716; 114-922-451-515-738; 115-714-360-380-014; 116-117-073-776-594; 118-750-463-452-09X; 120-043-942-225-993; 138-940-587-804-475; 143-706-938-315-733; 160-070-080-067-876; 161-272-671-839-534; 177-593-945-958-492; 193-215-782-066-909,1

By allowing different noise distributions, the proposed HTM model maintains the generality of Thurstone's original framework, and as such, also extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons to heterogeneous populations of users. Under this framework, we also propose a rank aggregation algorithm based on alternating gradient descent to estimate the underlying item scores and accuracy levels of different users simultaneously from noisy pairwise comparisons. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm converges linearly up to a statistical error which matches that of the state-of-the-art method for the single-user BTL model.

Promentilla; Kathleen B. Aviso; Raymond R. Tan,"Abstract Low-carbon energy systems are being proposed as portfolio of solutions to mitigate CO 2 emissions from the electricity-generating power sector. Stakeholder's perception on such technology plays a crucial role in its successful implementation. Not only the technological and economic aspects, but also the environmental and social aspects that surround these technologies should be considered in in determining which of these energy systems should be promoted, invested in, and subsidized. This decision problem should take into consideration the trade-offs due to several conflicting aspects involved in the prioritization. This paper thus proposes Fuzzy Analytic Network Process as a decision modeling tool in a group decision making environment to address the complexity of the decision structure and the uncertainty inherent in eliciting value judgments from stakeholders or experts. Fuzzy numbers are used to model the uncertainty, vagueness and incompleteness of information thus derived. The method then extends the fuzzy preference programming technique to derive the group priorities or weights from fuzzy pairwise comparative judgment matrices. A numerical example is presented to illustrate the proposed approach in prioritizing low carbon energy systems in the Philippines.",61,,808,811,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Risk analysis (engineering); Decision problem; Engineering; Pairwise comparison; Fuzzy number; Group decision-making; Energy planning; Management science; Fuzzy logic; Decision model,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214028008 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1876610214028008 https://core.ac.uk/display/81960296 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81960296.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.egypro.2014.11.970,,10.1016/j.egypro.2014.11.970,2018995290,,0,034-462-943-992-667; 035-304-231-490-397; 048-155-253-512-580; 067-341-125-020-782; 070-262-927-048-069; 081-532-972-369-677; 091-253-318-578-416; 091-681-693-508-242; 155-141-751-338-53X,11

Seiler; Gerd Holbach,"Approaches to determine acoustic quality on board ships are usually based on a three- or five-stage classification system using critical A-weighted sound pressure levels. At times other criteria such as the sound insulation between cabins, impact noise from upper decks, speech interference levels or general noise-rating curves are also taken into account. With regard to increasing requirements of passenger comfort and crew accommodation, a more detailed evaluation of auditory perception on board would be worthwhile. Furthermore, other industrial sectors have stated that psychoacoustic or room acoustic models are useful tools to analyze and guarantee product-sound quality. In order to find better indicators for the quantification of acoustic performance of (luxury) vessels, audio material was acquired at a sea trial and evaluated with the help of a paired-comparison listening test in the laboratory by 30 test-persons. Also, the possibility to comment the judgments was given to the subjects. The results were then analyzed by using the statistic model of the ""Law of Comparative Judgment"" and compared by correlation analysis with physical, psychoacoustic and room acoustic parameters. Highly correlating parameters could be identified.",133,5,3553,3553,Soundproofing; Law of comparative judgment; Sea trial; Acoustics; Crew; Auditory perception; Computer science; Sound pressure; Statistic; Psychoacoustics,,,,,https://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/poma/19/1/10.1121/1.4800462 https://asa.scitation.org/doi/full/10.1121/1.4800462,http://dx.doi.org/10.1121/1.4806456,,10.1121/1.4806456,1973184331,,0,,3

Very little use has been made of the information obtained in this process. Instead, research has focussed upon the analysis of health state valuation data obtained using the visual analogue scale, standard gamble and time trade off methods.; ; Thurstone’s law of comparative judgement postulates a stable relationship between ordinal and cardinal preferences, based upon the information provided by pairwise choices. McFadden proposed that this relationship could be modelled by estimating conditional logistic regression models where alternatives had been ranked. In this paper we report the estimation of such models for the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and the SF-6D. The results are compared to the conventional regression models estimated from standard gamble data, and to the observed mean standard gamble health state valuations.; ; For both the HUI2 and the SF-6D, the models estimated using rank data are broadly comparable to the models estimated on standard gamble data and the predictive performance of these models is close to that of the standard gamble models. Our research indicates that rank data has the potential to provide useful insights into community health state preferences.

155-252-500-807-129,A chess rating system for evolutionary algorithms: A new method for the comparison and ranking of evolutionary algorithms,,2014,journal article,Information Sciences,00200255,Elsevier BV,Netherlands,Niki Veček; Marjan Mernik; Matej Črepinšek,"Abstract The Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST) is of utmost importance for comparing evolutionary algorithms as the performance of one algorithm over another can be scientifically proven. However, NHST is often misused, improperly applied and misinterpreted. In order to avoid the pitfalls of NHST usage this paper proposes a new method, a Chess Rating System for Evolutionary Algorithms (CRS4EAs) for the comparison and ranking of evolutionary algorithms. A computational experiment in CRS4EAs is conducted in the form of a tournament where the evolutionary algorithms are treated as chess players and a comparison between the solutions of two algorithms on the objective function is treated as one game outcome. The rating system used in CRS4EAs was inspired by the Glicko-2 rating system, based on the Bradley–Terry model for dynamic pairwise comparisons, where each algorithm is represented by rating, rating deviation, a rating/confidence interval, and rating volatility. The CRS4EAs was empirically compared to NHST within a computational experiment conducted on 16 evolutionary algorithms and a benchmark suite of 20 numerical minimisation problems. The analysis of the results shows that the CRS4EAs is comparable with NHST but may also have many additional benefits. The computations in CRS4EAs are less complicated and sensitive than those in statistical significance tests, the method is less sensitive to outliers, reliable ratings can be obtained over a small number of runs, and the conservativity/liberality of CRS4EAs is easier to control.",277,,656,679,Small number; Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Evolutionary algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Null hypothesis; Ranking; Minimisation (psychology); Computer science; Outlier; Statistical hypothesis testing,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.154 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S002002551400276X https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.154 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S002002551400276X https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.154 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/isci/isci277.html#VecekMC14,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.154,,10.1016/j.ins.2014.02.154,2055089682,,0,003-131-921-427-332; 004-517-758-614-856; 004-913-631-345-366; 005-114-382-914-884; 005-715-135-509-893; 009-140-237-217-681; 011-105-391-999-886; 012-805-413-375-374; 017-650-345-826-142; 018-216-231-392-934; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-587-142-686-01X; 019-958-393-696-278; 020-593-979-518-694; 022-322-449-570-506; 024-955-760-107-218; 025-065-150-668-677; 025-888-926-115-744; 026-902-382-174-918; 030-837-737-798-954; 032-512-055-966-321; 033-044-052-943-53X; 041-082-326-378-53X; 044-050-513-768-931; 044-112-613-385-189; 045-089-324-346-363; 045-707-721-965-77X; 046-263-137-449-372; 046-997-215-980-533; 048-567-429-522-311; 051-894-385-146-524; 053-095-920-304-128; 053-154-815-087-878; 053-527-671-002-482; 053-678-293-807-694; 054-217-254-867-98X; 055-187-558-782-071; 057-998-762-941-254; 059-364-306-183-769; 059-529-487-387-05X; 064-176-452-338-805; 064-554-840-472-817; 066-466-618-230-289; 068-380-202-099-219; 071-360-952-960-717; 077-340-792-009-737; 082-597-956-517-75X; 084-578-547-221-009; 084-980-257-768-474; 085-880-523-163-119; 087-280-036-466-773; 087-991-691-200-809; 088-649-155-147-154; 090-176-157-030-077; 092-204-661-419-91X; 096-239-462-922-956; 096-896-377-991-551; 099-743-476-270-057; 102-115-650-201-495; 103-517-793-380-177; 110-192-393-251-350; 111-522-529-961-77X; 117-910-336-742-880; 121-182-804-437-943; 125-121-800-344-949; 134-209-258-360-246; 136-621-707-837-706; 151-288-965-637-720; 152-313-615-159-27X; 155-375-984-153-773; 166-254-921-592-937; 169-315-743-971-736; 169-385-037-131-231; 175-616-267-008-733; 177-695-779-968-907; 185-311-656-631-751; 186-296-666-044-634; 191-301-977-587-825; 192-050-479-821-730,79

Therefore an analysis was performed in the frame of the EC project HYRESSA, regarding the question “What are the individual user requirements on hyperspectral imagery and the related data products?”. For this analysis a questionnaire and a subsequent benefit-value analysis helped to retrieve users needs and evaluate open items accordingly. Following the methodology of the Value-Benefit Analysis (VBA), the answer can be described in hierarchical ordered multidimensional objective model.; The VBA serves as well-known tool for systematic problem solving process as a possibility of comparing projects or solutions. It enables the evaluation on the basis of a multidimensional objective model and can be extended by expert’s preferences. Therefore the scaling method (Law of Comparative Judgment) was applied for receiving the desired ranking judgments. The result, which is the relative value of projects concerning a well-defined main objective can now be produced analytically.; The investigation showed – besides details on user needs – that a VBA is a suitable method to analyse needs of hyperspectral data and to support sensor/data specification-building process. The VBA has the advantage, to be easy and clear to handle, resulting in a comprehensive evaluation. The disadvantage are the necessary efforts and the partly non-availability of all sensor data parameters. The paper summarizes all results of the analysis and gives insight to VBA methodology, statistics and others more.",,,,,Visual Basic for Applications; User requirements document; Hyperspectral imaging; Law of comparative judgment; Ranking; Relative value; Information retrieval; Disadvantage; Attractiveness; Computer science,,,,,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/98382/1/2007%20NiekeJ_EARSeL_2005%20Kopie%20.pdf https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/98382/,https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/98382/,,,3109286796,,0,,0

Shah; Sivaraman Balakrishnan; Joseph K. Bradley; Abhay Parekh; Kannan Ramchandran; Martin J. Wainwright,"Data in the form of pairwise comparisons arises in many domains, including preference elicitation, sporting competitions, and peer grading among others. We consider parametric ordinal models for such pairwise comparison data involving a latent vector w* e Rd that represents the ""qualities"" of the d items being compared; this class of models includes the two most widely used parametric models|the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) and the Thurstone models. Working within a standard minimax framework, we provide tight upper and lower bounds on the optimal error in estimating the quality score vector w* under this class of models. The bounds depend on the topology of the comparison graph induced by the subset of pairs being compared, via the spectrum of the Laplacian of the comparison graph. Thus, in settings where the subset of pairs may be chosen, our results provide principled guidelines for making this choice. Finally, we compare these error rates to those under cardinal measurement models and show that the error rates in the ordinal and cardinal settings have identical scalings apart from constant pre-factors.",17,1,2049,2095,Parametric statistics; Topology; Minimax; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Parametric model; Preference elicitation; Mathematics; Upper and lower bounds; Ordinal number,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01462 https://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-189/15-189.pdf http://eecs.berkeley.edu/~nihar/publications/aistats2015.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2946703 http://jmlr.org/papers/volume17/15-189/15-189.pdf https://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/v17/15-189.html https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015arXiv150501462S/abstract https://eecs.berkeley.edu/~nihar/publications/aistats2015.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1505.html#ShahBBPRW15 https://research.jmlr.org/papers/v17/15-189.html https://arxiv.org/pdf/1505.01462,https://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01462,,,2147987877,,0,000-652-203-673-023; 003-884-026-543-130; 004-269-574-716-057; 005-276-189-163-574; 007-417-885-892-956; 007-601-141-881-701; 010-132-302-334-522; 011-105-391-999-886; 013-770-460-061-385; 017-422-516-426-553; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-313-788-423-049; 021-304-036-982-259; 021-526-803-476-474; 023-436-952-259-389; 023-478-492-046-416; 028-900-912-419-323; 029-480-818-954-512; 032-718-506-620-930; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-867-159-731-756; 036-474-044-572-635; 036-734-271-423-953; 045-671-292-372-287; 047-307-839-107-965; 048-167-285-948-942; 048-215-075-687-055; 050-943-988-713-681; 059-974-800-186-525; 065-524-837-869-927; 067-860-359-894-241; 068-664-598-856-515; 073-146-716-099-406; 076-050-960-166-845; 077-685-278-656-310; 086-993-701-614-697; 088-912-834-943-633; 092-474-419-202-077; 095-207-546-053-994; 096-027-163-314-868; 105-197-803-566-972; 106-261-546-582-460; 107-790-959-417-375; 112-714-330-059-351; 113-079-030-498-041; 123-524-633-373-163; 124-171-041-782-890; 132-958-917-686-422; 137-940-671-974-155; 152-760-702-983-990; 161-247-307-055-667; 168-788-495-210-658; 172-137-286-231-28X; 187-350-157-372-059; 196-686-533-213-568,46

ABSTRACT IN ENGLISH: The goal of the present study was to determine the systematic influence of three parameters in force-angle-curves on the perceivable preference of rotary switches. A rotary haptic simulator was used to collect preferences in pairwise comparisons of 11 heterogeneous rotary characteristics from 45 subjects. A Bradley-Terry-Luce-model leads to highly consistent preferences. The most preferred rotary characteristic leads to a scale value 13 times higher than the least preferred alternative. A Conjoint Analysis reveals different weighting factors for three varied parameters in underlying force-angle-curves. The results are helpful for developers in identifying measurable parameters which have a significant impact on the perceivable quality rating of rotary switches.

Bergersen; Jo Erskine Hannay; Dag I. K. Sjøberg; Tore Dybå; Amela Karahasanovic,"The skills of software developers are important to the success of software projects. Also, when studying the general effect of a tool or method, it is important to control for individual differences in skill. However, the way skill is assessed is often ad hoc, or based on unvalidated methods. According to established test theory, validated tests of skill should infer skill levels from well-defined performance measures on multiple, small, representative tasks. In this respect, we show how time and quality, which are often analyzed separately, can be combined as task performance and subsequently be aggregated as an approximation of skill. Our results show significant positive correlations between our proposed measures of skill and other variables, such as seniority, lines of code written, and self-evaluated expertise. The method for combining time and quality is a promising first step to measuring programming skill in both industry and research settings.",,,305,314,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Forecast skill; Informatics; Source lines of code; Software; Visualization; Computer science; Knowledge management; Test theory,,,,,http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006092579 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6092579/ https://doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2011.39 https://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ESEM.2011.39 https://doi.ieeecomputersociety.org/10.1109/ESEM.2011.39 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/esem/esem2011.html#BergersenHSDK11 https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6092579/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/esem.2011.39,,10.1109/esem.2011.39,2170555906,,0,006-186-244-359-973; 009-616-998-337-769; 011-613-126-616-320; 014-943-543-039-895; 015-646-857-233-354; 018-746-726-900-660; 020-865-247-029-963; 029-970-477-759-162; 031-109-457-925-999; 034-234-129-593-27X; 034-960-300-780-558; 037-433-832-297-086; 040-643-417-873-73X; 043-839-828-807-044; 047-170-233-181-584; 047-341-264-809-331; 050-804-196-910-142; 050-877-331-621-042; 053-455-613-537-518; 053-923-034-009-985; 060-793-228-079-835; 064-120-073-762-638; 064-474-962-765-60X; 078-058-643-861-122; 078-082-517-555-79X; 080-688-218-800-503; 082-723-713-627-473; 084-780-125-638-524; 094-209-617-418-229; 095-944-339-500-114; 102-741-469-072-084; 111-359-845-763-049; 118-845-273-059-475; 119-405-534-418-817; 125-894-267-538-829; 139-004-159-912-159; 148-524-639-092-095; 153-322-476-465-533; 153-969-499-516-847; 166-533-955-715-626; 173-967-386-279-423; 176-195-461-339-484; 190-650-392-799-522,22

In a recent study (Gertner et al. in Cortex, doi:                            10.1016/j.cortex.2012.03.019                                                     , 2012), we found that the size congruency effect (SiCE) for physical judgments (i.e., comparing numbers' physical sizes while ignoring their numerical values, for example,                                                         8) was modulated by the spatial position of the presented numbers.

This pattern gave rise to the idea that number-space synesthesia might entail not only discrete, ordered, meaningful symbols (i.e., Arabic numbers) but also continuous non-symbolic magnitudes (i.e., sizes, length, luminance, etc.). We tested this idea by assessing the performance of two number-space synesthetes and 12 matched controls in 3 comparative judgment tasks involving symbolic and non-symbolic stimuli: (1) Arabic numbers, (2) dot clusters, and (3) sizes of squares. The spatial position of the presented stimuli was manipulated to be compatible or incompatible with respect to the synesthetic number-space perceptions. Results revealed that for synesthetes, but not for controls, non-symbolic magnitudes (dot clusters) as well as symbolic magnitudes (i.e., Arabic numbers) interacted with space. Our study suggests that number-space synesthetes might have a general magnitude-space association that is not restricted to concrete symbolic stimuli. These findings support recent theories on the perception and evaluation of sizes in numerical cognition.",13 Suppl 1,,S179,83,,,Analysis of Variance; Female; Humans; Mathematics; Perceptual Disorders/diagnosis; Photic Stimulation; Reaction Time/physiology; Space Perception/physiology; Synesthesia; Young Adult,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22810422,22810422,,,,0,000-203-307-444-846; 001-244-253-407-376; 010-140-848-414-399; 010-818-726-913-655; 015-544-596-134-608; 023-290-232-151-661; 024-126-457-246-305; 038-395-026-012-885; 069-593-985-303-866; 083-553-608-069-016; 114-858-026-742-426,1

157-742-635-567-294,Taking product replacement decisions by means of the Analytic Hierarchy Process,,2008,,,,,,Pierre Hellström,"In an economic environment signified by shortened product lifecycles, product proliferation and; reduced profit margins, product replacement decision making (PRDM) ought to be an important part; of management. The case is however often that considerably more energy and resources at a firm are; spent at the opposite task, hence product development. The main purpose of this master thesis was to; construct and test a model that provides structure for PRDM, this by implementing and combining the; advantages of the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP), the SWOT analysis and the Product Lifecycle; Concept (PLCC) into one coherent model.; The model referred to was tested at a German company, Webasto AG, a supplier within the motor; vehicle industry, where suboptimal product proliferation had been the case regarding one of its offered; products. The product was actually three air heater models, all fulfilling about the same spectrum of; customer needs in the lower output range. This implied, triple offering of similar products was realised; to cause bad utilization of resources at the company, meaning complications such as higher inventory; costs, more references to purchase, higher costs due to component discontinuation notices and more; suppliers to manage. In this paper we further refer to the three investigated products as: “WH-α”,; “WH-β” and “WH-γ”. WH-α represents an old product version, WH-β an intermediate version –; indeed resembling WH-α with respect to its product breakdown structure– and WH-γ a newer,; conceptually different, state-of-the-art product. The model framework for PRDM consists of five; steps:; STEP 1 –THE REVIEW PROCESS. Here we review the overall product situation at the company (or; business unit) and state the current, precipitating circumstances for evaluating our potentially weak; products.; When relating to the performed case-study at Webasto AG the management responsible for air; heaters expressed the four circumstances “operational problems”, “development of a variety reduction; policy”, “poor sales performance” and “poor profit performance” as being apt precipitating; circumstances for our product-mix review.; STEP 2 –DETECTION OF WEAK PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. This step initially involves stating; the criteria which will be used to detect our potentially weak products. In short, the AHP is based on; three principles performed in consecutive order. The principle of decomposition corresponds to; forming a suitable decision hierarchy for some problem of investigation, including formation of; hierarchy levels and its sub elements; e.g. the paramount, overall goal for the evaluation, the criteria to; measure against as an intermediate level, and the decision alternatives of choice as the bottom-level.; The consecutive principle of comparative judgments means pairwise comparing the elements within; each level with respect to a higher level’s element or goal, by using a comparative scale. The scale,; foremost focusing on the respondent’s intensities of feelings rather than on numbers, is central to the; AHP concept. As these comparisons have been made we furthermore compute the results according to; an AHP algorithm. These computations, followed by a synthesis of priorities, enable us to finally; obtain a rank order for our alternatives of choice, i.e. the products.; In the case-study, the management initially stipulated four suitable product criteria for finding the; most valuable product: sales-growth (%), relative market-share (%), profitability (%) and earnings; (k€). When furthermore wanting to prioritise the criteria with regard to their mutual importance, the; author let eight concerned managers give their individual opinions of how the criteria related. The; obtained group opinion, followed by some computations, generated the following priorities:; Earnings 48,7%, Sales-growth 22,2%, Profitability 21,8% and Relative market-share 7,4%.; The next phase of Step 2 meant letting a single top executive manager pairwise compare the products; as to how he perceived the products to perform under each criterion. These judgments as input data to; the prior mentioned AHP-algorithm furthermore generated the following AHP rank order:; 1) WH-γ = 79,3% 2) WH-β = 13,2% 3) WH-α = 7,4%; STEP 3 –ANALYSIS OF PERFORMANCE FACTORS. This step of the evaluation process means a; possibility to obtain complementing, qualitative information about the products. In Step 3 we start off; by complementing the products’ situations by analysing them with regard to their perceived strengths,; weaknesses, opportunities and threats. We then additionally widen our perspectives on the products by; examining their sales history, thereafter mapping the products with respect to the Product Lifecycle; Concept (PLCC).; In our case-study the SWOT analysis told us that WH-γ was a clear winner as it was more modern,; technically more efficient, better performing, had more features and was cheaper to produce. Indeed; the two other products had strengths such as being products well known to the customers, as well as; being products somewhat easier to maintain. However, as WH-α and WH-β were similar in product; structure, yet conceptually different to WH-γ, the weakness “differing product breakdown structures; to WH-γ” was realised to be a major disadvantage for the two older products.; When finally examining and mapping the individual products with respect to the classical PLCC,; WH-α was estimated to currently be somewhere in the late decline stage. WH-β was moreover; estimated to be in the late maturity stage, however most likely to enter the decline stage within a year.; As last, WH-γ showed the preferable signs of being in the growth stage, expected to take over; customers from its two forerunners – and thereto also winning over brand new customers – in the; future.; STEP 4 AND 5 –EVALUATION AND DECISION. This step corresponds to evaluating all; information gathered, thereafter taking a final replacement decision.; In this step of evaluation the prior mentioned top executive manager once again evaluated the; products, but this time he did it considering all results gathered:; WH-α had continuously received weak notes during the evaluation and was proposed and formulated; to be “abolished as soon as possible in order to avoid further losses” (6 months was mentioned by the; management as a possible timeframe).; WH-β indeed showed good sales figures for the current year (2006), but as the large majority of; customers had already decided to definitely switch to the newer WH-γ the coming year (2007), it; should undoubtly be phased out. –However, as the company did not want to abolish both old products; at the same time, WH-β was proposed to be gradually phased out, this instead of a more sudden; termination. (12-18 months was estimated to be a reasonable timeframe.); When examining the end results of each aspect of the product evaluation WH-γ was a clear winner!; The outcome of the AHP, the SWOT analysis and the PLCC all motivated to keep and grow the; product. The explicit formulation sounded: “Keep growing the WH-γ and take over the customers; from the old products!”",,,,,SWOT analysis; Engineering; Pairwise comparison; New product development; Product lifecycle; Product breakdown structure; Operations research; Product proliferation; Analytic hierarchy process; Strategic business unit,,,,,http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1979410,http://lup.lub.lu.se/student-papers/record/1979410,,,224379096,,0,,0

Individuals with DD have problems learning standard number facts and procedures. Estimates of the prevalence rate of DD are similar to those of developmental dyslexia. Recent reports and discussions suggest that those with DD suffer from specific deficits (e.g., subitizing, comparative judgment). Accordingly, DD has been described as a domain-specific disorder that involves particular brain areas (e.g., intra-parietal sulcus). However, we and others have found that DD is characterized by additional deficiencies and may be affected by domain-general (e.g., attention) factors. Hence ""pure DD"" might be rather rare and not as pure as one would think. We suggest that the heterogeneity of symptoms that commonly characterize learning disabilities needs to be taken into account in future research and treatment.",25,6,989,1008,Developmental psychology; Learning disability; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Comorbidity; Developmental Dyscalculia; Developmental dyslexia; Numerical cognition; Subitizing,,Brain/pathology; Cognition Disorders/etiology; Comorbidity; Dyscalculia/complications; Humans; Judgment; Mathematics,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13854046.2011.599820 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21955112 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21955112/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13854046.2011.599820,21955112,10.1080/13854046.2011.599820,2009227257,,0,001-244-253-407-376; 001-499-673-641-104; 002-801-249-695-286; 003-375-024-877-035; 003-710-302-053-681; 006-018-212-644-312; 006-103-418-210-92X; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-720-683-958-49X; 007-396-120-137-676; 007-926-410-139-923; 008-969-825-870-669; 009-340-421-889-441; 009-556-793-911-251; 011-300-064-608-597; 012-627-787-071-501; 014-304-423-897-683; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-456-782-384-125; 016-227-375-936-145; 018-625-858-864-445; 019-125-244-295-044; 019-506-603-356-742; 019-860-778-949-357; 021-787-847-905-352; 022-974-967-046-45X; 023-254-266-920-133; 023-540-148-927-518; 024-843-824-931-155; 026-112-761-390-112; 026-380-955-565-508; 027-722-881-226-813; 027-992-812-182-300; 028-908-173-804-813; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-547-776-718-970; 032-176-592-076-025; 033-987-957-285-504; 034-781-820-914-931; 037-054-632-717-760; 037-412-595-529-118; 037-559-042-610-406; 037-889-601-530-069; 038-395-026-012-885; 040-395-538-000-329; 040-829-572-421-472; 041-443-014-739-771; 041-642-577-987-834; 042-108-554-770-743; 042-472-377-164-320; 046-313-665-115-379; 047-949-982-406-946; 050-888-533-834-795; 051-256-453-500-104; 051-456-721-176-715; 051-675-214-294-784; 052-556-423-157-22X; 053-700-538-957-999; 053-878-738-920-101; 055-643-503-860-593; 056-170-806-678-309; 057-733-109-082-529; 057-913-681-764-190; 058-571-827-675-115; 059-424-379-092-456; 059-567-501-807-581; 060-748-407-187-900; 060-778-427-738-113; 061-266-607-128-096; 061-323-329-939-929; 062-470-916-712-549; 062-656-252-133-557; 063-359-293-758-356; 063-613-578-276-837; 064-385-111-633-946; 064-500-009-321-226; 064-571-881-246-925; 065-514-941-137-479; 067-033-829-394-657; 071-879-952-650-138; 072-033-671-901-532; 072-157-343-216-127; 073-280-031-152-195; 074-165-321-817-880; 075-167-330-041-32X; 075-549-085-444-419; 075-944-117-571-050; 077-764-348-019-938; 077-801-593-495-321; 078-699-018-002-285; 079-224-041-509-479; 079-276-930-986-288; 080-398-235-691-622; 081-946-513-849-516; 083-606-662-113-360; 084-183-231-327-628; 086-027-766-461-637; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-502-240-081-234; 086-866-171-771-342; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-093-047-870-483; 088-849-249-876-733; 089-534-827-525-987; 090-195-354-371-755; 090-341-446-444-256; 092-892-579-103-029; 101-450-667-767-630; 102-296-464-178-530; 109-877-260-546-215; 109-899-292-094-572; 111-928-961-224-728; 112-217-581-044-309; 113-985-328-659-252; 114-896-235-828-864; 115-773-251-340-945; 116-953-283-915-381; 117-561-317-819-683; 120-204-913-104-353; 133-071-612-326-88X; 144-747-377-111-26X; 148-043-544-952-446; 153-174-100-314-196; 154-285-214-885-139; 156-224-911-677-54X; 166-688-877-483-052; 187-510-755-292-489; 194-903-265-762-557,25
158-452-981-154-119,The Ideal of Justice,2012-05-10,2012,,,,,,John Oberdiek,"This is a short draft contribution to a symposium on Amartya Sen's book, The Idea of Justice, the final version of which will appear in the journal Jurisprudence with a reply by Sen. I argue that Sen errs in claiming that it is not necessary to identify an ideal of justice to make systematic comparative judgments about justice and injustice. To illustrate this, and to situate Sen’s view within the broader landscape of political philosophy, I first consider GA Cohen’s own recent well-known attack on Rawls’s conception of justice, which takes the opposite tack to Sen’s. Though the two approaches differ fundamentally, Sen’s ""comparativism"" and Cohen’s especially robust brand of ""transcendentalism"" share the strategy, familiar from indirect consequentialist moral theories, of decoupling the criterion of right action from the decision procedure on how best to act. This move raises trouble for both views, but it seems to me that the trouble it raises for Sen’s is graver, for he eschews any need for an ideal of justice in favor a purely comparative decision procedure. Like a boat without a rudder, a decision procedure that does not appeal to a criterion of right action – here, the regulative ideal of justice – is aimless and adrift. We may not need a fully-developed theory to identify certain egregious injustices, but even to identify such blights as injustices, we need an ideal of justice.",,,,,Sociology; Law and economics; Law; Ideal theory; Injustice; Appeal; Final version; Democracy; Jurisprudence; Political philosophy,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2156941,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2156941,,,2018888451,,0,,0

Systematic comparisons require consistency in experimental design, evaluation sets, conversational systems and their outputs, and statistical analysis. We lay out a protocol for the evaluation of conversational models using head-to-head pairwise comparison. We analyze ten recent models that claim state-of-the-art performance using a paired head-to-head performance (win-loss-tie) on five evaluation datasets. Our findings show that DialoGPT and Blender are superior systems using Bradley-Terry model and TrueSkill ranking methods. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of our protocol to evaluate conversational agents and evaluation sets.

Amartya Sen argues that what we should not want is to follow the social contract approach revived by John Rawls, or transcendental institutionalism, in its preoccupation with perfectly just institutions. Sen makes an effective case against approaches, such as G. A. Cohen’s, concerned with transcendent, fact-independent principles of justice, but not against Rawls’ constructivist approach to justice when this is properly interpreted as making a weak transcendental argument. Situating Rawls’ approach within the tradition of the liberalism of freedom provides a basis for interpreting his Kantian constructivism as a form of transcendental institutionalism, and for revealing the affinities between Rawls’ idea of reflective equilibrium and Jurgen Habermas’ method of rational reconstruction. Such a Kantian conception of justice, concerned with constituting relations of equal liberty between free and equal citizens, remains essential for orienting our pursuit of justice.",40,7,665,682,Epistemology; Reflective equilibrium; Constructivism (philosophy of education); Philosophy; Transcendental number; Institutionalism; Transcendental arguments; Rational reconstruction; Social science; Social contract; Liberalism,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/38051736 http://psc.sagepub.com/content/40/7/665.full.pdf https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0191453714536431 http://psc.sagepub.com/content/40/7/665.short https://hub.hku.hk/bitstream/10722/200818/1/Content.pdf http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0191453714536431 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38051736.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0191453714536431,,10.1177/0191453714536431,2114511656,,0,,1

Research has mainly focused on behavioral rehabilitation, while little is known about performance changes and neuroplasticity induced by the concurrent application of brain-behavioral approaches. It has been shown that numerical proficiency can be enhanced by applying a small—yet constant—current through the brain, a non-invasive technique named transcranial electrical stimulation (tES). Here we combined a numerical learning paradigm with transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) in two adults with DD to assess the potential benefits of this methodology to remediate their numerical difficulties. Subjects learned to associate artificial symbols to numerical quantities within the context of a trial and error paradigm, while tDCS was applied to the posterior parietal cortex (PPC). The first subject (DD1) received anodal stimulation to the right PPC and cathodal stimulation to the left PPC, which has been associated with numerical performance's improvements in healthy subjects. The second subject (DD2) received anodal stimulation to the left PPC and cathodal stimulation to the right PPC, which has been shown to impair numerical performance in healthy subjects. We examined two indices of numerical proficiency: (i) automaticity of number processing; and (ii) mapping of numbers onto space.

The 175 responses were evaluated using comparative judgement: mathematicians compared pairs of responses and their judgements were used to construct a scaled rank order. We provide evidence establishing the reliability, divergent validity and content validity of this approach to investigating individuals’ written conceptions of mathematical proof. In doing so, we compare the quality of student and mathematician responses and identify which features the judges collectively valued. Substantively, our findings reveal that despite the variety of views in the literature, mathematicians broadly agree on what people should say when asked what mathematicians mean by proof. Methodologically, we provide evidence that comparative judgement could have an important role to play in investigating conceptions of mathematical ideas, and conjecture that similar methods could be productive in evaluating individuals’ more general (mathematical) beliefs.",61,,100824,,Mathematical proof; Discriminant validity; Mathematics education; Psychology; Ranking; Judgement; Conjecture; Content validity,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732312320300882 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10119188/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2020.100824,,10.1016/j.jmathb.2020.100824,3109266471,,0,000-160-682-576-472; 003-236-983-227-230; 003-489-443-706-914; 009-194-550-637-248; 010-429-522-282-274; 016-279-152-792-986; 019-737-685-768-000; 026-140-166-599-34X; 028-600-184-401-058; 029-674-735-548-346; 030-028-888-998-208; 037-550-015-414-716; 039-154-422-915-145; 040-241-846-826-833; 047-410-827-372-679; 047-880-503-988-078; 048-151-229-726-003; 048-157-976-249-914; 049-844-532-127-036; 051-564-843-867-774; 051-994-891-084-520; 052-556-386-273-247; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-564-379-087-831; 066-753-555-767-135; 067-022-905-420-746; 079-050-415-749-606; 090-794-868-877-416; 094-718-700-068-894; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-581-513-132-471; 108-549-236-916-870; 117-962-324-802-641; 122-448-167-938-324; 141-363-290-283-622; 169-639-186-979-268; 174-885-774-292-15X; 183-245-213-539-678; 183-648-179-920-825,0

Day; Roy S. Berns; Lawrence A. Taplin; Francisco H. Imai,"Theoretically, there can be a compromise between color and spatial image quality for multispectral imaging: Increasing the number of channels increases spectral and colorimetric accuracy, that is, color quality increases;decreasing the number of channels reduces image noise and other spatial artifacts, that is, spatial image quality increases. Two paired comparison psychophysical experiments were performed to scale color and spatial image quality in order to better understand this compromise. Test targets, a watercolor painting, and several dioramas were imaged using three-, six-, and 31-channel image acquisition systems. One of the three-channel systems was a professional grade trichromatic digital camera; the other systems used the identical research grade sensor. For the six- and 31-channel images, both direct pseudoinverse based transformations and the use of principal component analysis were used to convert from digital to spectral data. The spectral data were used to render colorimetric images. Pseudoinverse transformations were used to convert the three-channel images to colorimetry. Twenty-seven observers judged, successively, color and spatial image quality of colorimetric images rendered for an LCD display compared with objects viewed in a light booth. The targets were evaluated under simulated daylight (6800K) and incandescent (2700K) illumination and the visual data were transformed to quality scales using Thurstone's law of comparative judgments, Case V. The first experiment evaluated color image quality. Under simulated daylight, the subjects judged all of the images to have the same color accuracy, except the professional camera image that was significantly worse. Under incandescent illumination, all the images, including the professional camera, had equivalent performance. The second experiment evaluated spatial image quality. The results of this experiment were highly target dependent. A subsequent image registration experiment showed that the results of the spatial image quality experiment were affected by image registration to some degree. For both experiments, there was high observer uncertainty and poor data normality. Dual scaling and a graphical analysis of observer response data were used as alternate techniques to Thurstone's Law. These techniques yielded similar results to the Thurstone-based quality scales. The uncertainty was caused by insufficient ambiguity between images. A simultaneous analysis of the color and spatial image quality results for the research grade sensor indicated that the most preferred image types were the 31-channel images. Thus, it is possible for multispectral images with many channels to achieve similar color and spatial image quality to systems with just a few channels. The theoretical compromise between color and spatial image quality as the number of channels increased was not observed under these experimental conditions.",48,2,93,104,Color histogram; Color image; Artificial intelligence; Standard test image; Binary image; Image resolution; Computer vision; Image noise; Computer science; Image quality; Image processing,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Roy_Berns/publication/237677865_A_Psychophysical_Experiment_Evaluating_the_Color_and_Spatial_Image_Quality_of_Several_Multispectral_Image_Capture_Techniques/links/5540cfff0cf2718618dac3a1.pdf http://scholarworks.rit.edu/article/856/,http://scholarworks.rit.edu/article/856/,,,2112542542,,0,011-712-033-007-343; 016-818-472-117-12X; 019-304-454-948-406; 053-354-010-251-155; 062-312-743-357-759; 086-193-100-086-723; 100-492-891-075-523; 107-260-263-567-764; 115-205-807-950-461; 133-511-503-609-916; 151-696-248-320-723; 166-585-827-428-918,10

Faculty of Economics and Social Development,,Velta Parsova; Anda Jankava; Siim Maasikamae; Audrius Aleknavicius,"<jats:p>After the collapse of Soviet system, immediately after declaration of independence, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania decided to initiate land reform within the framework of agrarian reform. The defined general objectives of land reform were: to establish a fairer system of property and use rights, to create conditions for intensity and productivity increasing of land use, to strengthen the rights of lessors and tenants, to grant land to those who wish to cultivate or otherwise use the land. However, the legislation and administrative systems of separate Baltic States were different, so the objectives and tasks of land reform, as well as the measures and methods for implementing the land reform, were different. The aim of the article is to compare and evaluate the land ownership reform processes in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, to analyse their legal security, the objectives, tasks, process and procedures of the reform, as well as the results obtained. In order to find out the situation and to make comparative judgments and conclusions, in research mainly document analysis and monographic or descriptive method haves been used. The positive role of land reform in all Baltic States is the restoration of land ownership, which has led to more targeted and intensive use of land in agriculture and other sectors. Land reform has created the preconditions for initiative and action of landowners in market economy. An additional effect is the development and implementation of state-of-the-art real estate registration systems in administration of each state. The article also analyses the shortcomings and problems encountered during the reform.</jats:p>",,,,,,,,,,https://llufb.llu.lv/conference/economic_science_rural/2020/Latvia_ESRD_53_2020-215-222.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.22616/esrd.2020.53.025,,10.22616/esrd.2020.53.025,3133079993,,0,,0

Experiments 1-4 tested if mood affects comparative optimism using a mood manipulation that minimized experimenter demand. While the procedure was successful in inducing mood, we found no evidence for a mood effect on comparative optimism. The absence of a mood effect was not due to participants correcting their judgments in response to a presumed mood bias (Experiments 2, 3 and 4) or to participants proactively regulating their mood (Experiments 3 and 4). Experiment 5 compared the mood manipulation of Experiments 1-4 with an autobiographical recall procedure. Although the two methods were equally effective in inducing mood, only autobiographical recall influenced participants' comparative optimism.

Vocal dysperiodicities are summarized by means of a signal-to-dysperiodicity ratio (SDR) marker. It is shown that performing an adaptive forward and backward long-term linear prediction of each speech sample and retaining the minimal prediction error energy as a cue of vocal dysperiodicity results in an SDR that correlates with the perceived degree of hoarseness. The coefficients of the time-varying long-term linear predictive model are estimated by means of the recursive least squares algorithm. The corpora comprise sustained vowels and French sentences produced by male and female normophonic and dysphonic speakers. A perceptual assessment of speech samples, which rests on comparative judgments, is used to evaluate the ability of the acoustic marker to predict subjective measures of voice quality. Experimental results show that the adaptive approach gives rise to high correlations for sustained vowels as well as for sentences.",44,1,61,68,Linear prediction; Phonetics; Recursive least squares filter; Mean squared prediction error; Perception; Long-term prediction; Linear predictive analysis; Speech recognition; Computer science; Computer Applications,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-005-0003-3 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16929922 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/mbec/mbec44.html#KachaBG06 https://core.ac.uk/display/8869235 https://difusion.ulb.ac.be/vufind/Record/ULB-DIPOT:oai:dipot.ulb.ac.be:2013/70588/Details,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11517-005-0003-3,,,2095030803,,0,003-013-245-397-432; 003-160-755-622-505; 009-525-844-368-999; 013-993-451-192-971; 017-772-995-205-300; 027-829-918-233-321; 030-367-513-076-625; 039-721-571-193-711; 039-763-449-346-433; 060-359-129-566-396; 069-374-371-316-769; 071-761-925-959-339; 072-368-788-309-887; 078-212-546-295-15X; 081-769-251-449-365; 083-722-288-495-992; 085-273-243-915-596; 092-701-687-732-434; 106-164-986-503-75X; 111-284-738-453-236; 133-017-136-224-112; 146-293-872-876-533; 152-068-662-038-415; 162-007-497-005-313; 175-136-862-171-196,2

We conceptualised this issue as one of problematic judgements by assessors. Existing literature and evidence about judgements within performance appraisal and impression formation, as well as the small evolving literature on raters? cognition within medical education, provided the theoretical context to study assessor?s judgement processes.Methods and Results: In this thesis we present three studies. The first study adopted an exploratory approach to studying assessors? judgements in direct observation performance assessments, by asking assessors to describe their thoughts whilst assessing standard videoed performances by junior doctors. Comments and follow up interviews were analysed qualitatively using grounded theory principles. Results showed that assessors attributed different levels of salience to different aspects of performances, understood criteria differently (often comparing performance against other trainees) and expressed their judgements in unique narrative language. Consequently assessors? judgements were comparatively idiosyncratic, or unique.The two subsequent follow up studies used experimental, internet based, experimental designs to further investigate the comparative judgements demonstrated in study 1. In study 2, participants were primed with either good or poor performances prior to watching intermediate (borderline) performances. In study 3 a similar design was employed but participants watched identical performances in either increasing or decreasing levels of proficiency. Collectively, the results of these two studies showed that recent experiences influenced assessors? judgements, repeatedly showing a contrast effect (performances were scored unduly differently from earlier performances). These effects were greater than participants? consistent tendency to be either lenient or stringent and occurred at multiple levels of performance. The effect appeared to be robust despite our attempting to reduce participants? reliance on the immediate context. Moreover, assessors appeared to lack insight into the effect on their judgements.Discussion: Collectively, these results indicate that assessors score variations can be substantially explained by idiosyncrasy in cognitive representations of the judgement task, and susceptibility to contrast effects through comparative judgements. Moreover, assessors appear to be incapable of judging in absolute terms, instead judging normatively. These findings have important implications for theory and practice and suggest numerous further lines of research.",,,,,Grounded theory; Psychology; Cognition; Salience (language); Impression formation; Narrative; Judgement; Performance appraisal; Direct observation; Medical education; Social psychology,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.576832 https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:186130,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.576832,,,831620190,,0,,0

Srikant; Laurent Massoulié; Marc Lelarge; Bruce Hajek,"Given a set of pairwise comparisons, the classical ranking problem computes a single ranking that best represents the preferences of all users. In this paper, we study the problem of inferring individual preferences, arising in the context of making personalized recommendations. In particular, we assume that there are $n$ users of $r$ types; users of the same type provide similar pairwise comparisons for $m$ items according to the Bradley-Terry model. We propose an efficient algorithm that accurately estimates the individual preferences for almost all users, if there are $r \max \{m, n\}\log m \log^2 n$ pairwise comparisons per type, which is near optimal in sample complexity when $r$ only grows logarithmically with $m$ or $n$. Our algorithm has three steps: first, for each user, compute the \emph{net-win} vector which is a projection of its $\binom{m}{2}$-dimensional vector of pairwise comparisons onto an $m$-dimensional linear subspace; second, cluster the users based on the net-win vectors; third, estimate a single preference for each cluster separately. The net-win vectors are much less noisy than the high dimensional vectors of pairwise comparisons and clustering is more accurate after the projection as confirmed by numerical experiments. Moreover, we show that, when a cluster is only approximately correct, the maximum likelihood estimation for the Bradley-Terry model is still close to the true preference.",,,,,Combinatorics; Linear subspace; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Inference; Efficient algorithm; High dimensional; Mathematics; Maximum likelihood; Cluster analysis,,,,,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04631 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/1502.04631 https://arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04631.pdf https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1502.04631,https://arxiv.org/abs/1502.04631,,,2951517470,,0,001-004-209-528-581; 004-848-515-510-16X; 009-316-589-031-043; 010-132-302-334-522; 017-081-732-842-09X; 019-308-857-235-636; 034-175-000-996-02X; 067-860-359-894-241; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 092-025-047-854-336; 092-798-854-976-238; 094-222-344-008-721; 099-292-161-810-493; 109-668-006-494-690; 116-610-520-777-687; 125-667-490-657-695; 161-247-307-055-667; 168-838-973-937-775; 172-520-776-223-903; 181-375-967-075-390; 199-987-294-560-607,6

En este articulo, adopto un enfoque centrado-en-el-mundo respecto a cuestiones fundamentales de contenido y estructura. Mirando, en primer lugar, a algunos ejemplos tipicos de las listas de bienes basicos, elaboradas por los teoricos de la ley natural, analizo diversos candidatos (propuestos por ellos) a la lista correcta. Luego, me centro en cuestiones relativas a como hay que estructurar la ley natural, en particular, si la lista de bienes basicos es fi nita, si hay un bien supremo o superordenador y que tipos de relaciones jerarquicas han de existir �en el interior de los bienes basicos y entre ellos�, a fi n de que los bienes basicos sirvan como fundamento para el razonamiento practico sobre la moralidad. Las conclusiones generales que extraigo son: en primer lugar, que hay que tomar en serio la ontologia y evitar los errores categoriales, al identifi car los bienes basicos; en segundo lugar, que la estructura del bien exige un sistema de principios que hagan posible los diversos tipos de juicios comparativos en el interior de los bienes basicos y entre ellos, a fi n de que la teoria de la ley natural sirva como base para guiar decisiones morales concretas. EnglishTh ere are two methodologically distinct but complementary ways of approaching natural law theory. One is a mainly agent-centred approach, focusing on practical reasoning and the intelligibility of action, paying attention to human tendencies and inclinations. Th e other, more traditional and mainly world-centred approach, focuses on the metaphysics of the good by means of an analysis of human nature and human faculties, and of the way in which the good must be structured for it to be an object of human pursuit, more specifi cally, a foundation for moral decision- making. In this paper I take a primarily world-centred approach to fundamental questions of content and structure. First, looking at some typical examples from natural law theorists of lists of the basic goods, I analyse various members that they have proposed to see what the correct list must contain. Next, I look at questions concerning how the natural law must be structured, in particular whether the list of basic goods is fi nite, whether there is a supreme or superordinate good, and what kinds of hierarchical relations within and across goods must exist in order for the basic goods to serve as a foundation for practical reasoning about morality. Th e general conclusions I draw are, fi rst, that ontology must be taken seriously, and miscategorization avoided, when identifying basic goods; secondly, that the structure of the good requires a system of principles enabling various kinds of comparative judgment within and across goods, in order for natural law theory to serve as a basis for guiding concrete moral decisions.",,2,13,50,,,,,,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/descarga/articulo/5625409.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5625409,https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5625409,,,2564267723,,0,,1

Having defined these two dimensions, we then present the results of a research program conducted to explore the relationship between them. In general, using both experimental and correlational data, we find evidence of a compensation effect between the two dimensions when two targets are compared. That is, when one target is judged more positively on one of the two fundamental dimensions, the second is judged more positively on the other dimension. We show that this compensation effect is confined to these two fundamental dimensions rather than something that more broadly characterises comparative judgements on any two judgemental dimensions. We then explore the importance of this compensation effect for the formation, maintenance, confirmation, and communication of mixed stereotypes of social groups.",21,1,155,187,Competence (human resources); Social perception; Psychology; Social compensation; Social comparison theory; Social group; Research program; Compensation effect; Social psychology; Social skills,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546805.2010.517997 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-26750-005 https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.yzerbyt/Kervyn%20et%20al.%20ERSP%202010.pdf https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:80948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2010.517997,,10.1080/13546805.2010.517997,2106393606,,0,004-036-447-460-418; 004-474-032-379-466; 005-082-717-189-239; 006-783-939-346-007; 007-109-056-549-339; 007-295-628-866-21X; 008-347-948-216-943; 009-307-985-057-945; 009-483-259-196-994; 011-782-130-252-133; 012-213-004-280-64X; 012-560-811-148-828; 014-499-853-704-178; 018-797-152-471-288; 019-248-044-554-89X; 019-379-391-788-607; 023-537-627-321-057; 025-274-180-646-752; 029-291-085-676-195; 030-920-314-889-819; 033-126-433-640-240; 033-713-603-925-676; 034-273-020-391-932; 035-958-373-578-83X; 037-789-950-331-027; 038-199-658-596-841; 045-133-003-831-726; 046-757-684-755-547; 049-166-209-469-773; 049-563-284-942-97X; 049-658-609-563-831; 051-552-239-824-876; 054-225-035-623-563; 054-265-013-339-031; 057-540-609-484-902; 062-420-560-074-770; 068-095-735-045-632; 073-811-228-464-205; 077-374-129-751-658; 078-855-076-404-25X; 084-171-413-768-581; 089-637-653-830-640; 091-409-396-377-132; 094-348-194-477-04X; 095-970-610-959-053; 097-565-160-854-409; 108-908-502-536-662; 109-760-962-476-435; 110-377-093-995-148; 112-496-512-669-959; 113-722-754-419-628; 115-891-977-840-866; 121-996-842-851-355; 135-174-291-025-377; 148-696-307-259-101; 150-285-617-553-993; 154-610-500-266-714; 166-445-955-811-351; 186-467-343-182-948; 192-076-021-893-666; 192-105-867-714-203; 197-151-224-677-129,85
164-825-168-981-644,Ranking with Features: Algorithm and A Graph Theoretic Analysis,2018-08-11,2018,,arXiv: Learning,,,,Aadirupa Saha; Arun Rajkumar,"We consider the problem of ranking a set of items from pairwise comparisons in the presence of features associated with the items. Recent works have established that $O(n\log(n))$ samples are needed to rank well when there is no feature information present. However, this might be sub-optimal in the presence of associated features. We introduce a new probabilistic preference model called feature-Bradley-Terry-Luce (f-BTL) model that generalizes the standard BTL model to incorporate feature information. We present a new least squares based algorithm called fBTL-LS which we show requires much lesser than $O(n\log(n))$ pairs to obtain a good ranking -- precisely our new sample complexity bound is of $O(\alpha\log \alpha)$, where $\alpha$ denotes the number of `independent items' of the set, in general $\alpha << n$. Our analysis is novel and makes use of tools from classical graph matching theory to provide tighter bounds that sheds light on the true complexity of the ranking problem, capturing the item dependencies in terms of their feature representations. This was not possible with earlier matrix completion based tools used for this problem. We also prove an information theoretic lower bound on the required sample complexity for recovering the underlying ranking, which essentially shows the tightness of our proposed algorithms. The efficacy of our proposed algorithms are validated through extensive experimental evaluations on a variety of synthetic and real world datasets.",,,,,Algorithm; Least squares; Pairwise comparison; Matching (graph theory); Ranking; Matrix completion; Graph theoretic; Computer science; Probabilistic logic; Upper and lower bounds,,,,,https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2018arXiv180803857S/abstract https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03857 http://arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03857.pdf https://uk.arxiv.org/abs/1808.03857?context=stat https://arxiv.org/abs/1808.03857v1 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr1808.html#abs-1808-03857,https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/1808.03857,,,2886129097,,0,,2

Horn; Azzurra Ruggeri; Thorsten Pachur,"Judgments about objects in the world are often based on probabilistic information (or cues). A frugal judgment strategy that utilizes memory (i.e., the ability to discriminate between known and unknown objects) as a cue for inference is the recognition heuristic (RH). The usefulness of the RH depends on the structure of the environment, particularly the predictive power (validity) of recognition. Little is known about developmental differences in use of the RH. In this study, the authors examined (a) to what extent children and adolescents recruit the RH when making judgments, and (b) around what age adaptive use of the RH emerges. Primary schoolchildren (M = 9 years), younger adolescents (M = 12 years), and older adolescents (M = 17 years) made comparative judgments in task environments with either high or low recognition validity. Reliance on the RH was measured with a hierarchical multinomial model. Results indicated that primary schoolchildren already made systematic use of the RH. However, only older adolescents adaptively adjusted their strategy use between environments and were better able to discriminate between situations in which the RH led to correct versus incorrect inferences. These findings suggest that the use of simple heuristics does not progress unidirectionally across development but strongly depends on the task environment, in line with the perspective of ecological rationality. Moreover, adaptive heuristic inference seems to require experience and a developed base of domain knowledge.

By allowing different noise distributions, the proposed HTM model maintains the generality of Thurstone's original framework, and as such, also extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons to heterogeneous populations of users. Under this framework, we also propose a rank aggregation algorithm based on alternating gradient descent to estimate the underlying item scores and accuracy levels of different users simultaneously from noisy pairwise comparisons. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm converges linearly up to a statistical error which matches that of the state-of-the-art method for the single-user BTL model.

This study observes two first year modules of the undergraduate programmes that focused on the development of subject knowledge and practical craft skills. Broadening the educational experience and perspective of students to include design based aptitudes demanded a clear aligning of educational approaches with learning outcomes. As design is a complex iterative learning process it requires a dynamic assessment tool to facilitate and capture the process. Considering the critical role of assessment in the learning process, the study explored the relevance of individual student-defined assessment criteria and the validity of holistic professional judgement in assessing capability within a design activity. The kernel of the paper centres on the capacity of assessment criteria to change in response to how students align their work with evidence of capability. The approach also supported peer assessment, where student-generated performance ranks provided an insight into not only how effectively they evidenced capability but also to what extent their peers valued it. The study investigated the performance of 137 undergraduate teachers during an activity focusing on the development of design, processing and craft skills. The study validates the use of adaptive comparative judgement as a model of assessment by identifying a moderate to strong relationship with performance scores obtained by two different methods of assessment.

This question is approached through an examination of three distance teaching universities: the British Open University (OU), the Spanish Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED), and the Portuguese Universidade Aberta (UA).; ; A socio-cultural analysis explores the history, philosophical assumptions and applications of educational technology at each of the universities. Thus educational technology and distance education are discussed as interdependent and overlapping concepts. The socio-cultural approach is applied within a multi-modal systems theoretical framework. Along with these, the concept of world-view in intercultural communication is of central importance.; ; On the basis of this theoretical scaffolding the research has sought to avoid any comparative judgements of the relative 'superiority vs. inferiority' of the various distance teaching universities that might hinder meaningful interactions among them. As a qualitative inquiry the research rejects models and attitudes of assimilation ('cultural domination' or 'sub-cultural imperialism') and seeks to show the value of dialogue between, and the recognition of diversity among, the participating institutions.; ; Field work, including interviews and documentary analysis, has been conducted at the three major sites: Lisbon, Madrid and Milton Keynes. The interview data has been analysed using the GABEK (Ganzheitliche Bewaltigung von Komplexitat - Holistic Processing of Linguistically Represented Complexity) method. The analysis not only identified a number of key issues about educational technology and distance education, from a multicultural perspective, but it also gave rise to a new definition of educational technology in terms of curriculum and power.; ; The social function, along with the academic raison d'etre of these institutions, has been further explored and contextualised. Among the prominent topics that emerge from the various analyses is that of ethics: a relatively unexamined area in the field of distance education and educational technology. An effort has been made to introduce ethical concerns on the agenda for reflection among educational technologists and distance educational practitioners. I suggest that this topic has special relevance both to international collaborations and to the current engagement of the three universities in question with the promotion of distance education in developing countries. Finally, a proposal for the building up of communities of discourse in distance education in the various languages of this research is discussed.",,,,,Sociology; Educational technology; Interdependence; Pedagogy; Intercultural communication; Portuguese; Curriculum; Distance education; Multiculturalism; Developing country,,,,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/59384/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.390812,http://oro.open.ac.uk/59384/,,,2152300304,,0,,0

White; Murray Turoff; B.A. van de Walle,"In an extreme event or major disaster, very often there are both alternative actions that might be considered and far more requests for actions than can be executed immediately. The relative desirability of each option for action could be a collaborative expression of a significant number of emergency managers and experts trying to manage the most desirable alternatives at any given time, in real time. Delphi characteristics can satisfy these needs given that anyone can vote or change their vote on any two options, and voting and scaling are used to promote a group understanding. Further utilized with Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgment, a group decision or the range of acceptability a group is willing to consent to, can be calculated and utilized as a means of producing the best decision.

De diversiteit in klaslokalen wordt nog intenser gegeven de context van een wereldwijde onderwijsevolutie naar meer inclusieve leeromgevingen. Dit proefschrift hanteert een brede definitie van 'inclusie' die verwijst naar het tegemoetkomen aan de behoeften van alle leerlingen voor wie eerlijke onderwijskansen een uitdaging zijn. ; ; In dit proefschrift stellen we dat leerkrachten hun situatie-specifieke vaardigheden (d.w.z., perceptie, interpretatie en beslissingsvermogen) de kern vormen van hun competentie om onderwijs inclusief af te stemmen op de diverse sterktes en behoeften van leerlingen. Dit proefschrift focust zich in het bijzonder op leerkrachten hun professionele visie van inclusieve klassen als een situatie-specifieke vaardigheid. Professionele visie wordt gedefinieerd als het vermogen om inclusieve klassituaties op te merken en deze vervolgens te interpreteren.; ; In onderwijskundige literatuur werd het concept professionele visie nog niet toegepast op inclusieve klassituaties. Er is bijgevolg ook geen meetinstrument om leerkrachten hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen mee in kaart te brengen. Daarom had dit proefschrift tot doel om leraren hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen te meten en onderzoeken. ; ; Enerzijds werd evidentie verzameld om de validiteit van een video-gebaseerd instrument te onderbouwen dat leerkrachten hun professionele visie meet op vlak van twee dimensies van effectieve inclusieve klassen: (1) positieve leerkracht-leerling interacties en (2) differentiatie. Het paarsgewijs vergelijken van video clips wordt wordt hierbij onderzocht als een holistisch en onbevooroordeeld alternatief voor gevestigde analytische meetmethoden die professionele visie kwantitatief in kaart brengen. ; Anderzijds werden leerkrachten hun paarsgewijze vergelijkingen van video clips in verband gebracht met hun overtuigingen over het lesgeven aan diverse leerlingen enerzijds en hun differentiatiepraktijk anderzijds. Op die manier trachtten we meer inzicht te krijgen in de wijze waarop professionele visie zich verhoudt tot andere aspecten van leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken. ; Hiertoe werden vier empirische studies opgezet: een mixed-method studie met experten (N=30) en 3 kwantitatieve studies met een steekproef van leerkrachten (N=360-400) uit het secundair onderwijs. ; ; Dit proefschrift verbreedt het methodologisch onderzoek omtrent kwantitatieve meetmethoden die professionele visie meten. De onderzoeksresultaten ondersteunen de validiteit van de paarsgewijze beoordelingsmethode om leerkrachten hun professionele visie op een holistische en onbevooroordeelde manier mee in kaart te brengen. De combinatie van paarsgewijze vergelijkingen van video clips om leerkrachten hun opmerkingsvermogen te meten met een analytische assessment van leerkrachten hun redeneringen over de vergelijkingen, zorgt ervoor dat de professionele visie van leerkrachten op een meer omvattende manier kan gemeten worden dan gevestigde video-gebaseerde kwantitatieve meetinstrumenten tot nu toe hebben gedaan. ; Daarnaast biedt dit proefschrift ook meer inzicht in leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken door hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen in verbrand te brengen met andere competentie-aspecten zoals hun opvattingen over het lesgeven aan diverse leerlingen en hun differentiatiepratijk. De resultaten tonen aan dat leerkrachten hun opvattingen als filter werken op hun professionele visie en dat leerkrachten hun professionele visie ook gerelateerd is aan hun differentiatiepraktijk. De wijze waarop deze drie aspecten met elkaar in verband staan is echter complexer dan lineaire theoretische modellen suggereren.; ; Op basis van de inzichten uit dit proefschrift zien we team-gebaseerde professionele ontwikkeling, dat gebruik maakt van video-reflectie, als een veelbelovende methode om leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken te versterken",,,,,Art; Theology; Secondary education; Professional vision; Video based,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8680357,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8680357,,,3101426431,,0,,0

The present study investigated how the actor-recipient role affected the neural responses to self in emotional situations. Twenty-five participants were scanned while they were presented with positive and negative interpersonal events and were asked to rate the degree to which the actor/the recipient was that kind of person who caused the interpersonal event. Half of the trials were self-relevant events and the other half were other-relevant events. Results showed that people were more likely to isolate self from negative events when they played the role of actor relative to recipient. Pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pgACC) and posterior dorsal anterior cingulate cortex (pdACC) were more active for self than other only in negative events. More importantly, also in negative interpersonal events, dorsal medial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC) showed greater self-related activations (self - other) when participants played the role of recipient relative to actor, while activities in orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were greater for self than other only when the evaluation target played the role of recipient. These results showed that the actor-recipient role affected neural responses to self in emotional situations, especially when a recipient role was played in negative situations.",9,,83,83,Dorsum; Psychology; Interpersonal communication; Neuroscience; Orbitofrontal cortex; Anterior cingulate cortex; Prefrontal cortex; Posterior dorsal; Self evaluation,ACC; OFC; actor-recipient role; dmPFC; self-evaluation,,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4397920/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00083/abstract https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00083/full https://core.ac.uk/display/43898660 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4397920 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82843197.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00083,25926781,10.3389/fnbeh.2015.00083,1983207306,PMC4397920,0,000-090-458-316-333; 002-505-473-716-081; 003-475-354-542-631; 006-911-748-520-969; 011-077-306-855-453; 011-614-660-441-019; 012-419-306-168-454; 012-562-620-436-623; 012-711-607-971-687; 013-607-207-066-633; 018-757-245-440-011; 018-913-251-103-718; 021-231-221-156-384; 022-055-671-467-127; 025-040-015-759-364; 026-911-860-929-612; 032-472-211-574-60X; 032-878-786-125-186; 034-166-452-633-508; 034-794-418-243-263; 035-549-769-897-469; 037-314-251-572-842; 039-900-956-980-496; 042-575-131-829-363; 043-935-327-751-230; 046-845-982-969-48X; 047-834-459-423-020; 049-361-278-531-650; 053-063-822-947-369; 054-040-811-098-351; 062-109-701-280-585; 064-013-108-473-366; 069-104-481-684-167; 071-637-558-385-75X; 083-094-538-274-558; 086-711-040-036-739; 110-605-669-537-900; 111-765-991-529-342; 113-507-902-736-245; 132-937-990-592-892; 141-183-596-550-369; 155-219-342-663-670; 167-642-534-286-930; 177-021-047-065-955,9

We then use the choice experiment method to examine public preferences for three landscape features – hedgerows, farm buildings and scrubland – in the Monts d’Arree region (in Brittany, France), in the context of re-design of landscape conservation policy by the local environmental institute. Surveys were undertaken on two user groups, visitors and local residents. Our objective was to obtain empirical evidence of the difference between the preferences of tourists and residents, for landscape attributes. We then analysed the welfare changes of tourists and residents affected by different landscape programmes. Our results point out the strong divergence between the landscape preferences of the public and those of local public actors. The comparison of the estimated values of willingness to pay for single-attribute landscaping action shows some divergence between residents’ and tourists’ ranking of preferences for agricultural landscape areas. Finally, we find, at least for the socio-economic context examined in this study, that apart from its social, cultural and aesthetic values, rural landscape has economic values, and that agricultural landscape preservation tends to be more beneficial to low-income social groups.",83,4,318,326,Welfare; Public opinion; Regional science; Empirical evidence; Landscaping; Social group; Land-use planning; Geography; Willingness to pay; Land use; Environmental protection,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9225/1/Rambonilaza2.pdf https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9225/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12016547.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,2146957936,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 003-659-907-827-298; 006-207-712-491-984; 010-195-457-296-442; 012-445-521-918-448; 031-810-415-073-770; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-684-051-531-053; 043-434-210-939-330; 043-572-477-925-718; 044-942-614-127-037; 049-910-359-846-40X; 051-613-010-997-062; 056-496-966-212-532; 057-657-809-679-383; 068-789-689-250-577; 071-674-642-056-169; 078-581-156-350-030; 088-659-729-299-827; 089-468-883-189-639; 091-917-222-986-705; 096-992-181-947-700; 100-440-892-234-712; 106-653-949-616-859; 107-781-135-837-372; 114-685-371-109-418; 116-662-795-910-859; 121-799-282-909-64X; 126-061-052-053-058; 130-282-073-277-329; 131-048-718-892-320; 134-772-380-318-431; 137-320-762-612-929; 147-824-212-663-256; 163-775-862-947-738; 168-106-348-621-405; 195-199-201-721-385,110
175-325-633-559-886,Social Comparison and Shyness in Adolescents,,2010,,,,,,Nazmiye Çivitci,"Problem Statement: Shyness, which can be broadly defined as the discomfort and inhibition that emerge in the presence of others, is an important variable that inhibites interpersonal communication processes. Shy individuals have a tendency to make negative evaluations of themselves and this tendency can be more clearly observed in their relationships with other individuals (particularly with people who have higher qualities and better performance). Therefore, the comparative judgments that shy individuals make with others can be said to be effective in their selfevaluation process. According to the theory of social comparison, individuals have the tendency to compare themselves with others to assess their social situation. Adolescence is a noteworthy period with regard to social comparisons and making social comparisons with peers is a prominent characteristic in adolescents. In the literature, studies that focus on the relationship between adolescents’ perceptions and evaluations of themselves and shyness are encountered, yet it is worth investigating how social comparisons affect shyness in the adolescence period, during which social comparisons gain importance. Purpose of Study: This study aims to examine the nature of change that social comparisons in adolescents cause in shyness in relation to gender and school grade level. Method: The study was conducted on a total of 581 high school students, 247 of whom were female and 334 male. The data of the study were collected through the Social Comparison Scale and Shyness Scale. Twoway analysis of variance method was used to test whether there is a difference between the degrees of shyness according to gender and school",,,,,Shyness; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Interpersonal communication; Social comparison theory; Problem statement; Perception; Adolescence period; Social situation; Grade level; Social psychology,,,,,http://www.aniyayincilik.com.tr/main/pdfler/38/6_civitci_nazmiye.pdf,http://www.aniyayincilik.com.tr/main/pdfler/38/6_civitci_nazmiye.pdf,,,2188535562,,0,002-764-681-303-085; 010-044-477-883-523; 012-144-434-783-881; 015-801-182-960-322; 018-978-990-790-766; 019-013-573-793-371; 019-303-532-604-20X; 019-488-177-629-288; 020-057-850-586-726; 026-840-303-728-425; 027-166-543-321-696; 030-357-579-929-767; 030-524-624-000-355; 032-871-618-389-324; 041-754-878-958-275; 051-224-109-056-757; 060-577-386-644-004; 075-040-657-401-536; 075-182-565-526-773; 079-554-517-641-187; 083-241-594-067-374; 083-930-569-525-066; 089-027-637-195-01X; 094-466-200-465-131; 099-013-530-274-418; 101-650-463-485-830; 107-974-585-896-012; 114-981-942-328-777; 132-117-963-482-344; 150-740-610-763-535; 155-779-920-091-543; 174-036-436-946-716; 182-114-118-388-852,2

Noels; Yanjun Guan; Liping Weng,"Recent research points to Chinese people's elevated tendency to make positive self-evaluations, despite the general claim that East Asians do not self-enhance. We present three studies in support of a novel prediction that sociocultural change in China plays an important role in augmenting self-enhancement. We operationalized self-enhancement primarily in terms of the better-than-average effect (BTAE) and accounted for trait desirability or importance. We found that: (i) compared with Chinese Canadians, Chinese showed a stronger BTAE; (ii) within the Chinese, identification with contemporary Chinese culture uniquely predicted a stronger BTAE; and (iii) priming contemporary (vs. traditional) Chinese culture led to a stronger BTAE. Finally, we provided further evidence that motivation, in part, underlies the rising Chinese BTAE. We conclude by discussing the importance of both socioeconomic and cultural perspectives for understanding how and when of self-enhancement in contemporary China and other societies undergoing social change.",47,1,36,52,Trait; Socioeconomic status; Psychology; China; Social change; Chinese people; Self-enhancement; Chinese culture; Social psychology; Operationalization,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/ejsp.2214 https://dro.dur.ac.uk/18787/ https://scholar.dickinson.edu/faculty_publications/451/ https://scholar.dickinson.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1513&context=faculty_publications https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42129792.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/ejsp.2214,,10.1002/ejsp.2214,2471987815,,0,002-525-354-681-144; 002-597-966-013-414; 005-407-359-736-687; 006-681-613-651-362; 011-543-456-328-961; 011-614-660-441-019; 011-736-892-296-944; 012-419-306-168-454; 012-711-607-971-687; 014-911-453-978-286; 015-927-570-151-897; 016-555-885-042-136; 020-435-760-631-576; 020-696-840-914-301; 020-862-850-475-489; 021-585-094-477-270; 022-038-780-395-148; 023-501-583-004-820; 031-079-814-763-031; 031-269-053-619-277; 032-694-750-658-953; 037-222-350-455-416; 039-044-601-310-689; 040-101-192-715-362; 040-408-209-241-957; 042-217-088-321-168; 044-339-521-905-497; 046-406-093-355-678; 048-005-671-363-385; 058-556-476-472-029; 062-700-011-615-593; 065-440-481-084-388; 070-540-666-498-690; 071-279-344-361-966; 072-278-118-039-671; 074-027-787-304-571; 076-776-415-153-013; 078-602-468-774-596; 081-858-765-303-253; 083-338-756-901-837; 085-174-229-726-71X; 091-872-508-396-931; 092-931-956-976-757; 095-293-736-045-323; 097-259-505-627-629; 099-550-693-413-009; 104-084-221-964-48X; 104-596-391-703-361; 107-438-141-973-583; 110-068-946-437-377; 112-550-176-547-585; 116-144-214-174-794; 121-103-989-939-027; 121-149-041-967-73X; 134-851-903-001-771; 136-623-648-368-362; 145-357-497-053-298; 148-955-295-789-52X; 150-772-990-553-404; 156-650-662-656-562; 158-366-648-077-892; 169-343-968-665-367; 170-800-981-851-021; 178-585-481-236-673; 179-615-961-217-819,7

However, there is a possibility that these tendencies are prevalent only in Western cultures. The present paper reports on three studies of comparative self-other judgments conducted with Japanese university students. The results consistently showed that participants tended to focus simply on their own abilities, traits, or the likelihood of experiencing future life events, without paying much attention to their peers. These findings suggest first that there is a consistent tendency for people to place a greater weight on the self than normative standards when considering their comparative position in a group, and that this tendency is independent of the size or direction of comparative biases.",10,4,224,232,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Self; Life events; Normative; Social psychology; Pessimism,,,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1467-839X.2007.00231.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1467-839x.2007.00231.x,,10.1111/j.1467-839x.2007.00231.x,2135853221,,0,002-515-006-696-965; 003-344-211-812-18X; 006-848-251-417-086; 007-778-725-444-103; 008-723-463-031-98X; 011-614-660-441-019; 011-634-281-853-003; 012-419-306-168-454; 012-979-608-410-379; 013-244-335-600-845; 013-476-553-649-690; 022-940-056-786-160; 026-387-449-478-155; 027-919-963-140-641; 030-515-144-789-364; 032-104-735-088-638; 033-214-189-676-558; 044-762-143-820-709; 054-938-373-448-403; 055-188-811-784-201; 056-926-960-371-839; 063-581-732-407-353; 065-541-759-883-380; 072-373-911-510-874; 082-662-120-833-072; 086-630-335-134-411; 096-792-630-788-615; 105-583-418-831-173; 106-201-816-796-473; 107-854-421-865-889; 108-227-936-150-296; 108-351-541-737-461; 114-590-207-496-477; 118-952-603-519-168; 124-656-535-257-223; 138-045-472-021-090; 145-357-497-053-298; 170-800-981-851-021,6

Each scale value of each location is shown in Figure 2. Introduction A sentence describing a spatial relationship includes at least two objects: a located object and a reference object. However, when we indicate a located object with respect to a reference object using a spatial term, the scene usually contains extra objects that may look like the located or reference object in some cases. What role do such extra objects play on the apprehension of spatial terms? In this study, we examined whether the presence of an extra object like a located object changed the overall acceptability distribution of a projective spatial term in a given space. We conducted Experiment 1 with the acceptability-rating judgment similar to the task used in previous studies (Hayward & Tarr, 1995; Logan & Sadler, 1996). Then, Experiment 2 examined whether the presence of the extra object changed the acceptability distribution using the paired comparison method. Figure1: Mean acceptability rating (SD) of ue for each location in Experiment 1. Method In Experiment 1, the stimuli were constructed on a computer. They consisted of a black square (1° × 1° side), a black dot (0.12° × 0.12° diameter), and a white square (11° × 11° side). The black square was the reference object. The black dot was the located object. The white square was the background. The located object could appear in given 45 locations on the white square. The participants were required to judge how applicable the location of the dot was to ue (similar to above in English) in relation to the reference object, using a 9-point rating scale. In Experiment 2, the display was composed of the same kinds of objects used in Experiment 1, but unlike Experiment 1, two black dots were presented. Therefore, in a pair, one was the located object and the other was the extra object, and vice versa. The participants were required to compare the locations of the two dots in relation to the reference object and choose the dot more applicable to ue. Figure 2: Scale values of ue for each location in Experiment 2. The location of the highest value is defined as zero. Results and Discussion To evaluate the difference between the distribution patterns quantitatively, the rating and scale data were normalized to convert the values ranging from 0.0 to 1.0. We paired a rating value with a scale value in each location. Then, Pearson's product-moment correlation, r, was calculated to determine the similarity of pattern between the distributions. There was no similarity, r(45) = .14, p = .36. The distribution patterns in Experiments 1 and 2 differ completely from each other. This shows that judgment of the acceptability of a projective spatial term with regard to a given location will not be so simple when two or more objects are presented. That is, the presence of an extra object could have much effect on the acceptability of a located object to a projective spatial term. From the result of Experiment 1, the mean acceptability rating of ue for each location is shown in Figure 1. The highest values were along the vertical axis of the reference object. The result shows that the region with the highest rating values (near 9) along the vertical axis (the good region) always seems to take priority over other parts of the space, and that the acceptability rating decreases the further the space is from the good region.

Liu; Min Zhao; Qiang Yang,"A central goal of collaborative filtering (CF) is to rank items by their utilities with respect to individual users in order to make personalized recommendations. Traditionally, this is often formulated as a rating prediction problem. However, it is more desirable for CF algorithms to address the ranking problem directly without going through an extra rating prediction step. In this paper, we propose the probabilistic latent preference analysis (pLPA) model for ranking predictions by directly modeling user preferences with respect to a set of items rather than the rating scores on individual items. From a user's observed ratings, we extract his preferences in the form of pairwise comparisons of items which are modeled by a mixture distribution based on Bradley-Terry model. An EM algorithm for fitting the corresponding latent class model as well as a method for predicting the optimal ranking are described. Experimental results on real world data sets demonstrated the superiority of the proposed method over several existing CF algorithms based on rating predictions in terms of ranking performance measure NDCG.",,,759,766,Machine learning; Data mining; Artificial intelligence; Expectation–maximization algorithm; Pairwise comparison; Ranking; Collaborative filtering; Computer science; Probabilistic logic; Mixture distribution; Latent class model; Learning to rank,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/34019098 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1645953.1646050 https://dl.acm.org/ft_gateway.cfm?id=1646050&ftid=693394&dwn=1 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cikm/cikm2009.html#LiuZY09 https://www.cse.cuhk.edu.hk/irwin.king/_media/presentations/plpa_zachary.pdf http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=1645953.1646050 https://doi.org/10.1145/1645953.1646050 https://doi.acm.org/10.1145/1645953.1646050 https://repository.ust.hk/ir/Record/1783.1-18980,http://dx.doi.org/10.1145/1645953.1646050,,10.1145/1645953.1646050,1964758795,,0,003-868-023-351-977; 005-535-108-254-698; 005-795-877-177-376; 011-412-504-669-753; 011-609-498-917-624; 012-367-777-689-406; 014-703-690-282-366; 016-437-402-540-53X; 022-250-992-389-493; 034-837-721-471-856; 035-450-858-449-465; 072-405-510-003-234; 081-370-959-105-221; 083-510-449-816-992; 087-357-995-123-875; 088-185-235-230-617; 107-174-988-729-643; 119-518-606-987-236; 138-729-962-867-512; 153-906-359-466-085; 159-623-688-672-160; 172-858-077-868-372; 177-521-132-361-223,98

Blume,"Operability is a driving requirement for NASA's Ares 1 launch vehicle. Launch site ground operations include several operator tasks to prepare the vehicle for launch or to perform maintenance. Ensuring that components requiring operator interaction at the launch site are designed for optimal human use is a high priority for operability. To support design evaluation, the Ares 1 Upper Stage (US) element Human Factors Engineering (HFE) group developed a survey based on the Universal Design approach. Universal Design is a process to create products that can be used effectively by as many people as possible. Universal Design per se is not a priority for Ares 1 because launch vehicle processing is a specialized skill and not akin to a consumer product that should be used by all people of all abilities. However, applying principles of Universal Design will increase the probability of an error free and efficient design which is a priority for Ares 1. The Design Quality Evaluation Survey centers on the following seven principles: (1) Equitable use, (2) Flexibility in use, (3) Simple and intuitive use, (4) Perceptible information, (5) Tolerance for error, (6) Low physical effort, (7) Size and space for approach and use. Each principle is associated with multiple evaluation criteria which were rated with the degree to which the statement is true. All statements are phrased in the utmost positive, or the design goal so that the degree to which judgments tend toward ""completely agree"" directly reflects the degree to which the design is good. The Design Quality Evaluation Survey was employed for several US analyses. The tool was found to be most useful for comparative judgments as opposed to an assessment of a single design option. It provided a useful piece of additional data when assessing possible operator interfaces or worksites for operability",,,,,Operability; Engineering; Human factors and ergonomics; Crew; Launch vehicle; Support design; Human use; Operations research; Operator (computer programming); Universal design,,,,,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110001605 https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/249191,https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110001605,,,844974212,,0,,0

In contrast, comparative judgement studies suggest that it is possible to assess open ended tasks such as writing with greater reliability. Many previous studies, however, have failed to provide direct comparisons between these approaches as the reliability measures for rubric- and marking-based studies are not comparable with the internal measures of reliability cited by comparative judgement studies. We investigated the classification accuracy and consistency of a rubric-based approach to the grading of writing with a comparative judgement approach. The writing was gathered from 11-year-olds in low stakes settings in England. We present evidence that the comparative judgement approach has twice the classification accuracy as the rubric-based approach and is perfectly viable in terms of its efficiency. We discuss the limitations of the comparisons and consider what a national system for assessing writing based on a comparative judgement approach could look like.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzus4,,10.31235/osf.io/vzus4,,,0,,0

Eggleton,"This study examines comparative judgments of numerical information, specifically accounting information. An earlier study by Rose, Beaver, Becker, and Sorter' concluded that comparative judgments of accounting information reflected a psychophysical law, the Weber-Fechner Law. While the results of the earlier study seem consistent with the law, Rose et al. did not attempt to determine if the process of making comparative judgments of numerical information is similar to a psychophysical process. We organize the discussion of the current study in the following manner. First, we describe the Weber-Fechner Law and its application in the earlier study. Then we provide results from the first of two experiments which indicate that while subjects' data are consistent with the Weber-Fechner Law the data plots of subjects raise serious doubt that an individual's manner of handling data is similar to a psychophysical process. As a result of Experiment 1, we hypothesize that subjects develop decision rules for handling numerical information and tend to apply these decision rules throughout the comparative judgment task. Next we discuss Experiment 2 which describes the replication of the majority of Experiment l's findings and documents the existence of the hypothesized decision rules. Many accounting experiments do not attempt to elicit the types of decision rules subjects use to deal with data. We offer a new tool: a decision tree approach to eliciting decision rules which allows the experimenters to more thoroughly describe subjects' mental processes with respect to the",13,,38,72,Lying; Stimulus (physiology); Econometrics; Psychology; Accounting information system; Cognitive psychology; Decision tree; Decision rule,,,,,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/joares/v13y1975i1p38-72.html https://www.jstor.org/stable/2490648,https://ideas.repec.org/a/bla/joares/v13y1975i1p38-72.html,,,2336616792,,0,060-554-948-059-48X; 084-193-570-203-610,2

However, when there is insufficient time or money to conduct a detailed trial of each proposed innovation, are there other less resource intensive methods that can be used? Here, we present a study conducted with thirty-six learning sciences experts and practitioners who were asked to judge the potential effectiveness of eighty collaborative learning activities using an adaptive comparative judgment (ACJ) approach. The results of the ACJ process show that the most innovative and effective collaborative learning activities are those that are monitored but not formally assessed. In addition, the use of technology and the explicit support of students’ social and problem-solving skills are identified as important features of innovative collaborative learning activities that are likely to be effective. The contribution of this paper is twofold. First, it presents features of innovative collaborative learning practice that are considered to be important for effectiveness by experts. Second, it provides an ‘innovative’ research approach to assess educational practice when teaching is considered as a design science rather than a theoretical science.",,,,,Collaborative learning; Need to know; Design science; Use of technology; Theoretical science; Computer science; Knowledge management; Delphi method; Learning sciences,,,,,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10052956/,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10052956/,,,3018587059,,0,,0

They consider the boundary value of the distribution, for example, that the maximal age a person can reach is 117 years old. Because the given anchor exceeds this value, people can reject it as a viable estimate and end up adjusting their estimate to that boundary. Importantly, in this process, people do not need to rely on their knowledge of the particular target in question (Gandhi). It is only in the next step, when people are asked to provide an absolute number that they access specific knowledge of the target. At this stage they compare target- related knowledge to the domain-maximum value to which they had adjusted and test the hypothesis that the target item’s extension is similar to the domain maximum. This confirmatory testing increases the accessibility of knowledge consistent with the hypothesis (e.g., Gandhi accomplished many things in his life; is often portrayed as an old man) and this knowledge is then used to form the absolute judgment (Mussweiler & Strack, 2000, 2001). This model explains how implausible anchors of different magnitudes can produce equally high estimates (e.g., the anchors 214 and 271 yield comparable estimates for Gandhi’s age; Mussweiler & Strack, 2001). In addition, this model makes an implicit assumption regarding the role of knowledge: Because the internally generated domain- maximum value that people use as a proxy for adjustment is the upper limit of the domain, this value must be the upper bound for estimates. People should therefore not provide estimates higher than that boundary. In this paper, we consider the relative role of knowledge and confidence in mediating the effect of implausible suggestions. Building on the aforementioned framework, we develop an account that explains how the impact of extreme anchors is mediated not only by people’s knowledge, but also by their confidence in that knowledge – i.e., by their meta-cognitive assessment of their own knowledge. A central premise of our account is that people’s confidence in their knowledge of the domain in question can affect their sensitivity to extreme anchors in the context of the comparative judgment. For example, consider two people who think that the maximum age a person can live is 125 years. One person is certain of this assessment, but the other is not. It is reasonable to expect that the first person will effectively adjust to 125 (as in Mussweiler & Strack, 2001), but that the second person will still be influenced by the initial implausible anchor. Confidence in target knowledge We propose a model of why implausible numeric suggestions function as anchors and influence people’s estimates. In two experiments we tested the hypothesis that people’s confidence in their knowledge modulates their susceptibility to implausible suggestions. We found that higher confidence reduces the impact of implausible anchors. A third experiment showed that knowledge, defined as participants’ agreement on a value, weakly affects the impact of a suggestion. These results indicate that theoretical accounts for the impact of implausible suggestions on estimations should consider the role of meta-cognitive information. Keywords: confidence, knowledge; anchoring; suggestions; assimilation Introduction People often make numeric estimations in circumstances of uncertainty. It is well known that in these situations they tend to assimilate their estimates to numeric values suggested to them. This assimilation bias, called anchoring (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974), has been demonstrated in several domains (for a review, see Chapman & Johnson, These suggested values do not have to be reasonable to exert an effect on estimation. For example, people who are asked to estimate Gandhi’s age at death provide higher estimates after being asked whether Gandhi died at the age of 214 than after being asked whether he died at the age of 86 (Mussweiler & Strack, 2001). The fact that even blatantly implausible suggestions can affect estimates is counterintuitive: because people should easily identify the claim Gandhi lived to 214 as false, they should easily discard this suggestion. This suggestion should therefore have little impact on judgment. Why is it then that implausible anchors affect people’s estimates? One possibility is that the influence of these suggestions is mediated by internally generated knowledge (e.g., Mussweiler & Strack, 2001). On this explanation, anchoring occurs as a consequence of two processes: an adjustment process (Tversky & Kahneman, 1974) followed by a selective accessibility process (Mussweiler & Strack, 1999, 2001, Strack & Mussweiler, 1997). Implausible suggestions are typically given by asking people to consider a numeric value via a comparative question, e.g., Was Mahatma Gandhi younger or older than 214 years when he died? When answering this question, people draw on their",31,31,,,Counterintuitive; Proxy (climate); Psychology; Cognition; Anchoring; Premise; Numeric Value; Absolute number; Abstract knowledge; Social psychology,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7735g9nv.pdf http://csjarchive.cogsci.rpi.edu/proceedings/2009/papers/44/paper44.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7735g9nv,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/7735g9nv,,,2626350277,,0,001-541-011-144-041; 058-958-978-790-31X; 069-727-881-724-448; 105-638-537-991-116; 117-150-305-299-565; 124-538-751-952-258; 130-971-600-994-543; 148-223-435-969-407; 163-413-656-134-535,0

These games are played among randomly drawn agents from the population. The agents in our model can be individuals, sports teams, or Wall Street fund managers. Formally, we postulate that the likelihoods of game outcomes are governed by the Bradley-Terry-Luce (or multinomial logit) model, where the probability of an agent beating another is the ratio between its skill level and the pairwise sum of skill levels, and the skill parameters are drawn from an unknown skill density of interest. The problem is, in essence, to learn a distribution from noisy, quantized observations. We propose a simple and tractable algorithm that learns the skill density with near-optimal minimax mean squared error scaling as $n^{-1+\varepsilon}$, for any $\varepsilon>0$, when the density is smooth. Our approach brings together prior work on learning skill parameters from pairwise comparisons with kernel density estimation from non-parametric statistics. Furthermore, we prove minimax lower bounds which establish minimax optimality of the skill parameter estimation technique used in our algorithm. These bounds utilize a continuum version of Fano's method along with a covering argument. We apply our algorithm to various soccer leagues and world cups, cricket world cups, and mutual funds. We find that the entropy of a learnt distribution provides a quantitative measure of skill, which provides rigorous explanations for popular beliefs about perceived qualities of sporting events, e.g., soccer league rankings. Finally, we apply our method to assess the skill distributions of mutual funds. Our results shed light on the abundance of low quality funds prior to the Great Recession of 2008, and the domination of the industry by more skilled funds after the financial crisis.",,,,,Multinomial logistic regression; Mean squared error; Minimax; Econometrics; Estimation theory; Pairwise comparison; Population; Computer science; Entropy (information theory); Kernel density estimation,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/corr/corr2006.html#abs-2006-08189 http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189 https://arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189 https://uk.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08189.pdf https://au.arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08189 https://export.arxiv.org/pdf/2006.08189 https://ru.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189 https://fr.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189 https://au.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2006.08189,,,3034636292,,0,002-978-775-225-739; 007-263-608-946-267; 015-960-815-319-235; 017-472-878-055-134; 021-526-803-476-474; 024-292-907-262-753; 031-830-169-787-740; 035-776-610-863-582; 047-307-839-107-965; 050-943-988-713-681; 054-477-181-455-722; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-310-338-398-932; 061-136-891-169-032; 075-695-797-470-645; 077-867-993-013-848; 079-367-665-908-927; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 093-840-610-421-917; 093-972-912-631-527; 094-086-462-600-570; 105-197-803-566-972; 120-424-874-837-080; 125-667-490-657-695; 127-441-799-485-44X; 136-510-755-969-787; 137-940-671-974-155; 144-071-446-558-528; 145-069-531-384-730; 155-729-366-689-349; 155-929-047-233-594; 180-320-023-189-230; 182-664-322-815-248,1

Typically, we see examples where air, water, and soil quality are significantly worse in poorer communities, especially poorer communities of color, than in wealthier, white communities. While poor environmental quality is not desirable, severely environmentally impacted communities, and the individuals who inhabit them, often face much worse consequences, in the form of health effects that can often have long-term implications for opportunities and achievements. The project of my dissertation is the creation of a flexible and empirically-informed model for both diagnosing the injustices and guiding policy decisions that will result in a more just distribution of risks, and prevent some of the grossest injustices. John Rawls and Amartya Sen provide the philosophical basis for the claims of injustice, and help to guide the normative conception I develop the latter parts of the work. Ultimately, I argue that we need a conception of environmental justice that will lead both to just institutional and background conditions to prevent harms, as well as providing mechanisms of restorative justice for those who have already faced harms. The Rawlsian project of Justice as Fairness will provide guidance for the institutional framework whose goal is the creation of more perfect justice, while Sen's work will aid in making comparative judgments of the well-being of particular individuals.",,,,,Environmental philosophy; Political science; Injustice; Environmental justice; Restorative justice; Much Worse; Policy decision; Normative; Environmental quality; Social psychology; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4t4657hn.pdf,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/4t4657hn.pdf,,,2717169,,0,001-771-901-558-522; 003-799-698-617-714; 007-069-920-374-137; 017-497-389-271-507; 023-574-904-115-271; 025-646-256-456-192; 027-558-440-139-915; 028-099-996-610-06X; 032-401-122-663-661; 039-003-790-204-840; 039-432-998-602-982; 043-883-123-991-134; 049-128-371-805-555; 052-220-863-072-861; 054-839-600-376-187; 055-807-396-257-315; 070-397-322-092-399; 071-909-144-827-841; 084-197-440-070-344; 086-563-866-424-701; 092-660-597-274-822; 092-694-285-819-358; 105-283-107-938-753; 110-832-006-128-874; 117-168-433-408-354; 117-647-475-198-322; 136-927-028-753-772; 142-394-135-676-598; 146-861-132-082-474; 156-150-479-039-661; 164-088-368-444-846; 168-261-041-163-50X; 171-728-774-468-17X; 185-381-796-100-841,0

Flynn,"Employees at all organizational levels have influence over their subordinates, their colleagues, and even their bosses. But are they aware of this influence? We present evidence suggesting that employees are constrained by cognitive biases that lead them to underestimate their influence over others in the workplace. As a result of this underestimation of influence, employees may be reluctant to spearhead organizational change, discount their own role in subordinates’ performance failures, and fail to speak up in the face of wrongdoing. In addition to reviewing evidence for this bias, we propose five moderators that, when present, may reverse or attenuate the underestimation effect (namely, comparative judgments, the objectification or dehumanization of an influence target, the actual degree of influence any one influencer has, the means of influence, and culture). Finally, we offer some practical solutions to help employees more fully recognize their influence over other members of the organization.",,,,,Psychology; Cognitive bias; Wrongdoing; Objectification; Organizational change; Dehumanization; Social psychology,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2340820 https://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2340820,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2340820,,,3121987469,,0,,0

Across seven experiments we employed the delayed judgment-of-learning (JOL) paradigm with healthy young adults to examine metacognitive monitoring of learning. After studying cue-target word-pairs, participants were presented with the studied cues and predicted their ability to retrieve the target on a subsequent memory test. The key question of interest was the nature of the underlying processes guiding such judgments with a focus on how they relate to memory. The delayed JOL literature has assumed that it is an absolute judgment, based on the ease of access to the target item. Chapters 2 and 3 manipulated target- and cue-related variables and investigated their influence on memory and metamemory. The results showed delayed JOLs are also sensitive to memory for contextual information about the target (Chapter 2) and the level of familiarity with the cue term (Chapter 3). This is strengthened by results from Chapter 4 in which participants provided written justifications of their JOL responses without any experimental manipulations of the learned material. Analysis of these responses confirmed that both cue- and target-related information influences delayed JOLs. Lastly, we showed that delayed JOLs are not sensitive to whether they are predicting recognition or recall (so called theory-based influences) unless participants make a different prediction on each trial (i.e. trial-level design, Chapter 5). Overall, delayed JOLs are shown to vary with variables that fluctuate on a trial level, which can but do not necessarily need to map onto memory. The results suggest that delayed JOLs are primarily comparative judgments, involving the evaluation of the quantity and quality of evidence on any given trial in the context of the task at hand (e.g. by comparison to preceding trials). This is contrary to how it is often treated in the delayed JOL literature but is consistent with other metacognitive paradigms.",,,,,Recall; Metacognition; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Metamemory; Contextual information; Associative learning; Metacognitive awareness; Memory test,,,,,http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16590/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.707037,http://etheses.whiterose.ac.uk/16590/,,,2616378798,,0,000-514-011-740-097; 005-169-402-174-974; 009-760-549-021-407; 010-653-609-575-842; 010-984-852-076-054; 016-197-387-773-174; 016-563-998-205-958; 016-664-789-862-225; 021-108-015-827-032; 024-061-773-989-093; 026-119-065-307-639; 030-127-028-026-904; 035-656-441-404-951; 037-721-662-396-909; 037-877-478-251-292; 038-190-041-244-052; 039-379-366-517-632; 041-343-389-202-921; 045-516-343-240-306; 047-317-588-308-322; 050-788-494-852-203; 051-905-742-573-622; 054-582-943-608-030; 056-270-842-074-172; 057-201-095-850-701; 063-666-519-797-623; 064-171-157-111-031; 066-461-860-099-642; 070-583-119-908-419; 073-568-611-138-552; 074-753-056-820-093; 075-048-003-535-603; 077-567-853-037-149; 080-309-682-801-97X; 083-047-706-121-496; 083-791-170-087-722; 085-042-179-086-229; 085-086-470-410-834; 085-286-144-253-825; 090-537-092-647-340; 101-254-851-247-047; 102-587-934-616-786; 104-098-106-207-122; 105-379-442-656-207; 111-265-079-047-31X; 113-225-920-618-482; 125-672-159-248-513; 128-337-748-163-738; 134-695-429-827-792,0

Media is an instrument of communication, like a newspaper or a radio, so social media would be a social instrument of communication. In Web 2.0 terms, this would be a website that doesn't just give information, but interacts with its users while giving them information. When it comes to online social networking, websites are commonly used. These websites are known as social networking sites. Social networking websites function like an online community of internet users. Depending on the website in question, many of these online community members share common interests in hobbies, religion, or politics. Once you are granted access to a social networking website you can begin to socialize. This socialization may include reading the profile pages of other members and possibly even contacting them.This paper attempts to do study of effectiveness of advertisements in facebook in terms of simplicity, robustness and the ability to incorporate both ‘tangibles’ and ‘intangibles’ into the decision-making process. The AHP proposed in this research is to handle factors and sub-factors of effectiveness of brands links on facebook. The outcome of AHP is the weight of each decision alternative. Three steps are followed for considering decision problems by AHP namely constructing hierarchies, comparative judgment, and synthesis of weights. The objective of the study is to study whether the brand communities on social media sites plays any role in consumers purchase behavior. And also to check how the peer groups influence and word of mouth on social media sites affects the buying behavior of a person. This paper attempts to the study are based on the brand of the products which are based on the brand community trust, brand community affect. Also based on the individuals it is based on the purchase intention towards the brand and also the peer group recommendations that includes positive word of mouth towards the brand.",,,,,Advertising; Peer group; Word of mouth; Psychology; Brand community; Online community; Social web; Social media; Social media optimization; Social network,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2266899 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID2266899_code1902578.pdf?abstractid=2266899&mirid=1&type=2,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2266899,,,2407331408,,0,017-586-581-815-943; 036-784-682-767-502; 084-449-523-044-836; 093-657-789-269-488; 119-810-845-086-409; 181-346-433-081-275,5

By allowing different noise distributions, the proposed HTM model maintains the generality of Thurstone's original framework, and as such, also extends the Bradley-Terry-Luce (BTL) model for pairwise comparisons to heterogeneous populations of users. Under this framework, we also propose a rank aggregation algorithm based on alternating gradient descent to estimate the underlying item scores and accuracy levels of different users simultaneously from noisy pairwise comparisons. We theoretically prove that the proposed algorithm converges linearly up to a statistical error which matches that of the state-of-the-art method for the single-user BTL model. We evaluate the proposed HTM model and algorithm on both synthetic and real data, demonstrating that it outperforms existing methods.</jats:p>",34,4,4353,4360,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5860,,10.1609/aaai.v34i04.5860,,,0,,0

These competences are generally framed within worldwide policy initiatives towards more inclusive learning environments. This study explores how teachers’ beliefs about teaching diverse learners (i.e. teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity; teachers’ growth mindset; and teachers’ beliefs about differentiating the curriculum) affect teachers’ noticing of two aspects of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data for this study was collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (n = 462) in 23 schools. An online survey was administered to measure teachers’ beliefs using standardised scales. A standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument was used to administer teachers’ noticing of PTSI and DI. A multivariate multilevel analytical framework allowed us to assess how teachers’ beliefs simultaneously affect two aspects of teachers noticing, being teachers noticing of PTSI and DI while taking into account both differences between teachers and schools. Findings from the analyses suggest that teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity and teachers’ beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as a filter for noticing both PTSI and DI. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers’ noticing of DI relates to the school a teacher is working in. Findings of our study provide greater insight into teachers’ cognition of inclusive classrooms and have implications for the design of teacher professional development for inclusion.",,,,,Competence (human resources); Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Cognition; Judgement; Mindset; Differentiated instruction; Curriculum; Professional development,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8575561,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8575561,,,2901432727,,0,,0

Hal ini dikarenakan banyak terdapat kriteria yang berperan dalam persoalan tersebut. Apabila terdapat beberapa kriteria penilaian, proses pemilihan kriteria mana yang paling berperan untuk mengoptimalkan tujuan bukanlah suatu hal yang mudah dilakukan. Apalagi pada proses pengambilan keputusan penilaian dilakukan tidak hanya oleh satu orang ahli akan tetapi oleh beberapa pihak yang berkompeten dalam pengambilan keputusan. Dalam skripsi ini, akan dibahas pengambilan keputusan multikriteria dengan menggunakan metode Proses Hirarki Analisis (PHA) dan penerapan metode tersebut untuk mengetahui strategi pemasaran yang tepat untuk meningkatkan permintaan minyak goreng filma dari PT. Intermas Tata Trading. PHA menggunakan model hirarki yang terdiri dari tujuan, kriteria dan beberapa subkriteria serta alternatif untuk masing-masing permasalahan atau keputusan. PHA didasarkan atas empat prinsip dasar yaitu dekomposisi (decomposition), penilaian kriteria dan alternatif (comparative judgements), penentuan prioritas (synthesis of priority) dan konsistensi logis. PHA memperhitungkan pembobotan setiap kriteria secara konsisten sehingga dapat diketahui kriteria mana yang berperan untuk mengoptimalkan tujuan. Pembobotan kriteria pada PHA dilakukan dengan menggunakan matriks perbandingan berpasangan (pairwise comparison). Pembobotan dapat dilakukan dengan syarat matriks perbandingan konsisten. Matriks perbandingan akan konsisten apabila aturan transitivitas dan resiprokal terpenuhi. Strategi pemasaran pada PT. Intermas Tata Trading dianalisis menggunakan PHA. Hasil yang diperoleh dari pembobotan alternatif strategi pemasaran yang ada dengan menggunakan metode PHA dan proses pengolahannya dibantu dengan sofware Expert Choice version 9.0 adalah mengadakan promosi penjualan dengan nilai bobot prioritas terbesar yaitu 0,248 (24,8%) dan urutan program kerja untuk strategi tersebut adalah pemberian bonus sebesar 0,121 (12,1%), pemberian kupon sebesar 0,057 (5,7%), pemberian sampel sebesar 0,045 (4,5%), dan pemberian jaminan produk sebesar 0,025 (2,5%).",,,,,,,,,,http://eprints.uny.ac.id/1821/,http://eprints.uny.ac.id/1821/,,,1538362770,,0,,0

Carrasco, S. Ling, and S. Read (2004) reported that transient visual attentional cues could increase the perceived contrast of Gabor grating targets. We replicated their study using their exact stimuli and procedures. While we were able to reproduce their results, we discovered that the reported attentional effects vanished when we changed the type of decision that subjects performed from a comparative judgment (""which target has higher contrast?"") to an equality judgment (""are the two targets equal in contrast?"") that is resistant to bias. To ensure that the difference between the judgments was not due to a difference in attentional strategies, we also performed a control experiment in which subjects were instructed on a trial-by-trial basis which judgment to perform only after the stimuli had disappeared. In this experiment, the magnitude of attentional effect for the comparative judgment was diminished but still significant and the equality judgment still measured no effect. We conclude that the reported effects of attention upon appearance can be entirely explained by decision bias, and that attention does not alter appearance.",8,15,3.1,10,,,"Adult; Attention/physiology; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Cues; Decision Making; Female; Humans; Illusions/physiology; Male; Models, Neurological; Observer Variation; Photic Stimulation/methods; Reaction Time/physiology",,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19146287,19146287,,,,0,,28

Semantic distances allowed obtaining conceptual mental representations for 5 organizations that suggested a common conceptual representation that embraces at least 7 different leadership constructs. Moreover, two new leadership models emerged from the obtained conceptual organizations that are dynamical and emergent. They suggest an organizational leadership capable of taking antagonist leadership positions (Chung- Yung or middle; positions) and another one that suggests no action as a strategically approach to decision making (Wu-Wei).",,,,,,,,,,https://cd.dgb.uanl.mx/handle/201504211/16776 http://eprints.uanl.mx/4033/,https://cd.dgb.uanl.mx/handle/201504211/16776,,,1524221110,,0,,0
198-306-009-967-350,Applying the Law of Comparative Judement to Target Signature Evaluation,2000-03-01,2000,,,,,,James R. McManamey,"Abstract : The Law of Comparative Judgement (LCJ) is a psychophysical tool that can be used to scale complex phenomena that lack easily identified physical parameters. Target signatures represent such phenomena. In a demonstration exercise, a search difficulty"" value was found using the LCJ. These LCJ scale values were compared to search times and probabilities of detection from a search experiment run in the Netherlands. The scale values were not linearly related to search time and probability of detection, but correlated very well with the logarithm of mean search time (r = 0.936) and the cube of the number of correct responses (r = 0.954). A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test gave 94.6% confidence in the fit of the LCJ scale to the experimental data. While the LCJ results in a scale with no natural zero point and arbitrary units, this tool can be used to construct a standard scale: This paper illustrates how a standard clutter scale might be constructed using the LCJ. The LCJ could be a valuable tool in target signature evaluation either when used in conjunction with scaling equations that permit conversion to familiar quantities such as mean search time and probability of detection, by providing relative ""search difficulty"" values, or by making possible a psychophysically meaningful clutter scale.",,,,,Clutter; Scale factor; Psychophysics; Law; Target acquisition; Mathematics; Logarithm; Image processing; Statistical power; Scaling,,,,,,,,,246635540,,0,,0
199-002-627-009-233,Sustainability assessment of water distillation technologies using multi-criteria decision analysis,,2013,,,,,,Muttucumaru Sivakumar; Mohammad Ramezanianpour,"Seawater desalination is now widely accepted as a suitable response to the increasing demand of fresh water in remote coastal areas. This research aims to compare three water distillation systems and select the most sustainable water treatment option. A theoretical research is performed in this paper by a multi-objective analysis method with employing the realistic information from literature, author's judgement and available equations especially for costs. Due to the water and energy crisis in future and their dependency to each other, the application of renewable energy is considered in the assessment method for all three systems. Solar energy is preferred over wind or other types of sustainable energies as it can provide both electrical and heat energy. The three solar based water distillation systems examined in this study are categorised into solar vacuum membrane distillation (SVMD), solar multi-stage flash distillation (SMSFD) and solar direct contact membrane distillation processes (SDCMD). A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach is developed to identify the most sustainable technology. Specifically, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model is used to evaluate a treatment system against various sustainability criteria. Twelve sustainability indicators under three criteria groups are selected in the AHP model for pairwise comparison. The qualitative and quantitative indicators of environmental, economic, and social criteria have been used as a measure of sustainability for each of the water treatment processes. According to the analysis performed, the SVMD system is selected as the most sustainable system due to its weights obtained in comparative judgement of systems and total weight of indicators.",,,72,,Environmental resource management; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Sustainable design; Engineering; Environmental economics; Multi-stage flash distillation; Renewable energy; Distillation; Solar energy; Sustainability; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=795071439136608;res=IELENG,https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=795071439136608;res=IELENG,,,2293174748,,0,,1
