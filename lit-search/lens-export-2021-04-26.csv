000-201-100-655-524,Low-alloy steels,,1987,book,,,,,Chr. Boller; T. Seeger,"Materials data for cyclic loading are becoming increasingly important as a tool for materials characterization and engineering design. They can serve as the basis for a comparative judgement of a material's mechanical behaviour. Furthermore, knowledge of the stress-strain behaviour during cyclic loading is required more and more frequently in finite element calculations of cyclically loaded structural parts. Finally, such data are a fundamental input for the fatigue life estimation procedure known as the Local Strain Approach or Notch Strain Approach. Materials data for cyclic loading have been published in the scientific literature for many years, but have been collected in quite different ways. This is the first time that such data have been gathered together, evaluated according to uniform approach and methods, and compiled on standardised data sheets. The handbook comprises five volumes containing a collection of some 600 datasets with over 4000 experimental results in total.",,,,,Engineering; Alloy; Scientific literature; Finite element calculations; Cyclic loading; Engineering design process; Structural engineering,,,,,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA01523427,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA01523427,,,605546666,,0,,0

This synthesis is brought about by a dynamisation of classical structuralism, with an abductive inference rule and base generated revisions in the style of Rott (2001). The formalism of prioritised default logic (PDL) serves as the medium of the synthesis. Why seek to integrate the Sneed formalism into belief revision theory? With the hybrid system of the present investigation, a substantial simplification of the ranking information that is necessary to define revisions and contractions uniquely is achieved. This system is, furthermore, expressive enough to capture complex and non-trivial scientific examples. It is thus closely related to a novel research area within belief revision theory which addresses the dynamics of scientific knowledge.",20,2,205,232,Epistemology; Semantics; Belief revision; Defeasible reasoning; Non-monotonic logic; Default logic; Abductive reasoning; Sociology of scientific knowledge; Mathematics; Formalism (philosophy),,,,,https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9580/1/structuralist_theory_submission.pdf https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1969163 http://philsci-archive.pitt.edu/9580/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/jolli/jolli20.html#Andreas11 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/11923529.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3,,10.1007/s10849-010-9128-3,2109565636,,0,012-169-656-547-674; 015-489-641-949-592; 016-010-403-716-426; 016-149-127-818-130; 016-767-183-012-594; 018-374-056-110-760; 022-684-229-427-044; 022-754-452-317-471; 022-921-914-706-750; 026-618-674-853-498; 028-445-394-328-998; 030-834-774-216-948; 030-934-754-845-50X; 032-079-127-973-164; 036-178-901-774-500; 040-030-462-418-793; 047-154-012-405-29X; 048-864-279-505-700; 050-129-694-983-356; 051-780-172-791-081; 053-437-282-659-633; 053-467-600-852-453; 055-522-961-847-096; 059-996-900-937-514; 060-776-007-121-361; 080-770-812-047-65X; 085-455-289-826-182; 089-777-515-684-379; 097-650-179-395-034; 108-949-615-435-260; 110-723-990-997-177; 114-906-979-944-514; 121-960-896-069-92X; 140-601-577-639-803; 152-797-528-041-875; 158-124-631-059-784; 162-960-722-341-10X; 168-904-118-052-397; 178-226-411-455-462; 184-804-601-553-580; 193-914-737-522-349,7

However, risk measures can be viewed as instances of upper (or lower) previsions, thus letting us apply the theory of imprecise previsions to them. After a presentation of some well known risk measures, including Value-at-Risk or VaR, coherent and convex risk measures, we show how their definitions can be generalized and discuss their consistency properties. Thus, for instance, VaR may or may not avoid sure loss, and conditions for this can be derived. This analysis also makes us consider a very large class of imprecise previsions, which we termed convex previsions, generalizing convex risk measures. Shortfall-based measures and Dutch risk measures are also investigated. Further, conditional risks can be measured by introducing conditional convex previsions. Finally, we analyze the role in risk measurement of some important notions in the theory of imprecise probabilities, like the natural extension or the envelope theorems.",49,1,159,174,Statistics; Time consistency; Convex analysis; Imprecise probability; Econometrics; Generalization; Risk analysis (business); Risk management; Mathematics; Financial risk; Value at risk,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/82631279 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=2972364 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijar/ijar49.html#Vicig08a https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1401291 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0888613X07001338 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82631279.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijar.2007.06.009,,10.1016/j.ijar.2007.06.009,1992438271,,0,000-073-231-893-254; 000-217-390-110-173; 006-539-674-203-304; 022-514-907-123-778; 022-819-142-468-404; 027-745-294-420-402; 039-650-162-527-463; 040-692-674-064-248; 046-862-395-031-651; 047-349-419-416-564; 048-128-123-635-087; 054-506-646-981-619; 061-307-214-265-880; 068-926-087-240-142; 071-333-783-733-957; 074-125-162-418-973; 076-599-593-366-017; 078-368-076-079-583; 088-940-866-381-557; 095-248-429-329-403; 114-179-845-018-453; 120-875-606-655-347; 121-933-599-254-981; 135-767-102-249-763; 137-746-258-971-883; 148-184-674-526-137; 181-741-629-157-93X; 188-464-353-939-712; 196-393-219-430-629,19

The academic environment – where there is a tacit consensus on the interdisciplinary character of such an approach, on the perpetual relevance within the various (sub)disciplines, and on the somewhat exhaustion of the subordinated debates – remains subtly divided on a series of theoretical delimitations or historical evidence. This article aims to highlight a (sub)domain of the comparative analysis regarding the economic systems in which the literature is not as polarized as it is rarefied: what roots and reverberations does “social responsibility” have within the main economic systems and where and how its “ecological sustainability” component manifests itself?

This paper reviews existing research on this controversy and attempts to unify the evidence within a framework where expertise is utilised in the form of comparative judgement. Initially, the paper introduces a mathematical model for the way in which comparative judgement may operate. Data from existing studies of comparative judgement are then used to estimate suitable parameters for this model. Having derived a working mathematical model for the operation of expert judgement, the paper will then demonstrate that this model provides results that are broadly consistent with existing research, including both studies that are critical and studies that are supportive of the use of expert judgement. The model will then be applied to examine the required scale and design of expert-driven approaches to standard maintaining in order for the...",31,3,352,376,Statistical model; Psychology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Secondary education; Statistical analysis; Expert judgement; Management science; Mathematical model,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1099334 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,,10.1080/02671522.2015.1027723,2008316232,,0,001-776-625-574-472; 005-302-356-483-011; 006-459-131-027-623; 006-809-268-879-517; 007-381-818-286-903; 012-834-407-111-308; 017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-969-129-433-746; 043-208-094-772-83X; 045-347-578-027-687; 046-885-708-774-897; 056-004-643-676-048; 065-049-495-011-823; 066-718-263-808-78X; 074-502-843-992-015; 076-050-960-166-845; 087-991-691-200-809; 110-976-899-414-79X; 129-560-099-381-900; 145-779-409-320-756,2

Teachers' justice, whether distributive or procedural, predicts teachers' legitimacy.; ; Aims; What is still do be found, and constitutes the goal of this paper, is whether unjust treatment by a teacher affects the legitimacy of the teacher differently when the student knows that the teacher was fair to a peer (comparative judgement) or when the student does not have that information (autonomous judgement).; ; Samples; A total of 79 high school students participated in Study 1; 75 high school students participated in Study 2.; ; Methods; Two experimental studies with a 2 justice valence (just, unjust) × 2 social comparison processes (autonomous judgements, comparative judgements) between-participants design were conducted. Study 1 addressed distributive justice and Study 2 addressed procedural justice. The dependent variable was teachers' legitimacy.; ; Results; In both studies, situations perceived as just led to higher teachers' legitimacy than situations perceived as unjust. For the distributive injustice conditions, teachers' legitimacy was equally lower for autonomous judgement and comparative judgement conditions. For procedural injustice, teachers' legitimacy was lower when the peer was treated justly and the participant was treated unfairly, compared with the condition when the participants did not know how the teacher treated the peer.; ; Conclusions; We conclude that teachers' injustice affects teachers' legitimacy, but it does it differently according to the social comparisons involved and the type of justice involved. Moreover, these results highlight that social comparisons are an important psychological process and, therefore, they should be taken into account in models of justice.",87,1,1,15,Peer group; Social influence; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Pedagogy; Judgement; Injustice; Procedural justice; Distributive justice; Legitimacy; Social psychology,adolescence; justice; legitimation of authority; social comparison; teachers' legitimacy,Adolescent; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Peer Group; School Teachers/psychology; Social Justice/psychology; Social Perception; Students/psychology,,Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27743388 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5855776 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/bjep.12131 https://repositorio.ul.pt/bitstream/10451/25465/1/ICS_JVala_Teachers_ARI.pdf http://repositorio.ul.pt/handle/10451/25465 https://core.ac.uk/display/70656393 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1128885 https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjep.12131 https://ciencia.iscte-iul.pt/publications/teachers-legitimacy-effects-of-justice-perception-and-social-comparison-processes/30507,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjep.12131,27743388,10.1111/bjep.12131,2530063838,,0,000-793-522-021-320; 001-143-194-765-292; 004-258-141-622-035; 005-495-093-612-996; 005-749-412-532-166; 006-168-557-774-087; 006-351-367-205-583; 007-349-845-017-637; 008-368-152-891-401; 009-551-798-170-04X; 011-645-336-376-667; 012-253-763-505-500; 013-201-303-507-62X; 017-422-857-884-157; 017-517-491-290-822; 018-345-367-783-679; 019-067-922-399-510; 019-303-532-604-20X; 021-202-166-519-193; 022-410-613-342-653; 024-416-992-972-670; 024-850-329-245-487; 026-984-194-598-512; 028-885-818-303-882; 033-128-703-756-585; 034-520-222-312-601; 044-631-342-934-063; 046-060-368-161-907; 047-631-509-012-976; 048-982-260-032-314; 049-782-249-125-237; 050-233-705-923-00X; 055-286-802-666-413; 055-774-681-121-478; 056-262-231-756-713; 056-818-612-584-40X; 061-379-690-842-370; 063-748-507-673-219; 063-884-128-799-395; 069-461-689-880-613; 080-432-271-897-595; 082-352-175-716-849; 084-533-544-849-66X; 086-352-532-245-092; 094-547-037-831-06X; 104-609-012-649-220; 105-902-036-518-531; 110-190-366-395-317; 113-458-224-648-431; 113-863-321-246-45X; 115-496-105-545-923; 116-891-442-169-072; 122-285-331-503-303; 139-665-368-466-165; 141-156-952-462-602; 143-931-965-777-838; 145-580-394-010-991; 148-147-612-350-364; 151-988-446-443-26X; 152-956-494-176-469; 156-732-183-617-506; 159-465-812-137-384; 164-525-151-718-693; 164-548-615-185-955; 176-528-745-666-885; 179-286-899-946-791; 194-036-893-402-904,4

Brooker; Jeanette A. Lawrence,"Scholarly investigations of the first year experience identify various difficulties for students, yet few studies investigate how those difficulties relate to each other or how students’ appraisals help to overcome them. We asked two cohorts of first-year students (109 in 2013, and 98 in 2014) about their experiences with 11 commonly-cited difficulties. They used concept maps to make comparative judgements about their difficulties, appraised their biggest difficulty, and rated how they engaged with that difficulty. The students experienced multiple difficulties at a time. Time management, work load and others’ expectations were the most prevalent and biggest difficulties. Students who appraised their difficulties as challenging or benign were happier with how they addressed their difficulty than those who appraised difficulties as harmful or threatening. Implications include the benefits of addressing more prevalent issues, understanding that students face multiple difficulties, and helping students change their perspectives of their difficulties.",8,1,49,62,Psychology; Time management; Concept map; Perception; Medical education,,,,,https://www.mendeley.com/catalogue/ff972229-ff69-3557-bb64-b86ea40f7ad2/ https://doaj.org/article/bdb434acc83e4f5483144565872b4fda https://core.ac.uk/display/90848187 https://studentsuccessjournal.org/article/download/352/385,http://dx.doi.org/10.5204/ssj.v8i1.352,,10.5204/ssj.v8i1.352,2600801136,,0,013-955-781-913-308; 022-903-777-256-140; 025-932-387-062-289; 035-818-438-804-195; 048-214-999-047-029; 057-767-571-506-366; 097-177-365-192-811; 147-074-871-495-444,5

When these internally generated perturbations are sufficiently large, the behaviour of the system is not solely driven by the external stimulus but also by its own spontaneous variability. Behavioural internal noise can be quantified, provided it is expressed in relative units of the noise source externally applied by the stimulus. In humans performing sensory tasks at near threshold performance, the size of internal noise is roughly equivalent to the size of the response fluctuations induced by the external noise source. It is not known how the human estimate compares with other animals, because behavioural internal noise has never been measured in other species. We have adapted the methodology used with humans to the zebrafish, a small teleost that displays robust visually-guided behaviour. Our measurements demonstrate that, under some conditions, it is possible to obtain viable estimates of internal noise in this vertebrate species; the estimates generally fall within the human range, suggesting that the properties of internal noise may reflect general constraints on stimulus-response coupling that apply across animal systems with substantially different characteristics.",127,,104,114,Sensory threshold; Detection theory; Stimulus (physiology); Perturbation (astronomy); Visual perception; Instrumental and intrinsic value; Biological system; Zebrafish; Computer science; Communication; Sensory system,Behavioural inconsistency; Fish cognition; Intraindividual variability; Shoaling; Signal detection theory,"Animals; Behavior, Animal/physiology; Contrast Sensitivity/physiology; Models, Biological; Photic Stimulation/methods; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Signal Detection, Psychological/physiology; Visual Perception/physiology; Zebrafish/physiology",,Medical Research Council United Kingdom,https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/quantitative-assessment-of-intrinsic-noise-for-visually-guided-be http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/handle/2164/9125 http://audition.ens.fr/lsp/publis/bibtexbrowser.php?key=SpiliotiVargessonNeri2016&bib=publis_lsp.bib https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27491704 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698916300773 http://aura.abdn.ac.uk/bitstream/2164/9125/1/VR_15_230R1_1_.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698916300773 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27491704 https://core.ac.uk/display/77051651 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/131024391.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2016.07.004,27491704,10.1016/j.visres.2016.07.004,2516456640,,0,000-780-747-391-063; 002-179-276-158-788; 003-962-445-879-262; 004-449-360-245-032; 008-146-405-737-506; 013-814-875-435-176; 014-817-682-912-220; 016-176-258-618-343; 017-489-521-345-447; 020-507-686-448-510; 026-733-584-540-424; 028-076-095-893-54X; 029-327-694-011-043; 029-866-300-055-936; 031-221-219-999-992; 034-569-883-239-701; 037-666-478-940-346; 041-004-018-893-341; 042-059-104-578-318; 042-063-017-985-750; 051-140-761-924-916; 057-801-820-507-711; 066-514-418-237-498; 078-841-805-417-53X; 081-417-707-561-357; 087-472-070-435-547; 089-776-381-537-079; 090-489-598-566-800; 098-218-528-135-892; 102-563-060-160-493; 110-739-854-294-027; 136-532-913-760-020; 199-055-961-488-187,1

Typically there are two core types discussed within the pertinent literature; criterion and norm referenced assessment. However another form, ipsative assessment, refers to the comparison between current and previous performance within a course of learning. This paper gives an overview of an ipsative approach to assessment that serves to facilitate an opportunity for students to develop personal constructs of capability and to provide a capacity to track competence based gains both normatively and ipsatively. The study cohort (n = 128) consisted of undergraduate students in a Design and Communication Graphics module of an Initial Technology Teacher Education programme. Four consecutive design assignments were designed to elicit core graphical skills and knowledge. An adaptive comparative judgment method was employed to rank responses to each assignment which were subsequently analysed from an ipsative perspective. The paper highlights the potential of this approach in developing students’ epistemological understanding of graphical and technological education. Significantly, this approach demonstrates the capacity of ACJ to track performance over time and explores this relative to student ability levels in the context of conceptual design.",29,4,701,715,Competence (human resources); Design education; Mathematics education; Psychology; Educational technology; Norm-referenced test; Educational assessment; Adaptive comparative judgement; Technology education; Ipsative,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1226416 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs10798-018-9468-x.pdf http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1253264 https://ulir.ul.ie/handle/10344/7281 https://paperity.org/p/163021850/integrating-learners-into-the-assessment-process-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x,,10.1007/s10798-018-9468-x,2895625638,,0,001-602-934-365-877; 001-617-068-953-753; 003-019-903-218-043; 004-050-431-221-43X; 007-702-163-095-94X; 009-631-573-859-890; 010-842-784-742-516; 012-266-132-871-064; 014-241-046-842-349; 015-817-184-183-607; 018-038-526-594-681; 019-287-416-093-054; 022-733-495-955-948; 026-054-301-619-278; 027-032-207-723-393; 030-197-391-074-111; 030-375-075-778-212; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-839-824-768-13X; 035-991-030-021-460; 036-351-305-383-067; 036-497-875-075-084; 043-128-207-906-620; 043-333-362-919-74X; 043-438-378-373-391; 044-774-292-104-86X; 048-091-210-665-560; 050-280-479-496-83X; 051-913-507-216-545; 055-247-734-603-784; 066-456-556-577-391; 072-849-297-804-522; 083-934-915-116-715; 089-236-550-620-512; 093-534-400-662-274; 102-955-514-174-383; 105-060-972-080-52X; 107-096-746-639-636; 113-184-615-486-147; 120-836-425-113-053; 123-212-204-814-685; 126-686-530-645-374; 130-572-675-668-023; 131-341-345-187-68X; 138-111-878-359-49X; 140-317-325-310-325; 149-208-961-050-864; 163-921-650-292-293; 163-938-197-264-411; 165-468-169-541-10X; 165-708-633-922-222; 168-704-895-296-891,3

To determine if spatial structure was observable at detection threshold contrasts, we simultaneously measured contrast detection and orientation–identification thresholds of flickering gratings. We then measured the apparent size of flickering grating bars at sub-threshold to supra-threshold contrast levels using two matching criteria: (1) by adjusting the spatial frequency of a stationary comparison grating and (2) by adjusting the distance between two parallel thin lines. For all subjects, contrast detection and orientation–identification thresholds were similar, indicating that sufficient spatial structure is observable at detection threshold to make judgements of local spatially defined features. With increasing flicker rate, the apparent periodicity of low (0.25 and 0.50 cpd) spatial frequency test gratings increased. At detection threshold contrast levels and below, all observers reported difficulty in performing the match and results were variable. Size matches using stationary gratings were consistently smaller than those made using the line targets, which is suggestive of distortion in perceived spatial structure at the nodal region of flickering gratings.",47,13,1732,1744,Spatial frequency; Sensory threshold; Distortion; Optics; Flicker; Frequency-doubling illusion; Grating; Apparent Size; Poison control,,"Adult; Contrast Sensitivity; Form Perception; Humans; Illusions; Orientation; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds; Time Factors",,,http://pubmed.cn/17481693 https://core.ac.uk/display/81104937 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Andrew_Metha/publication/6349094_Spatial_structure_of_the_frequency_doubling_illusion/links/0c960528daad31f8d1000000.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698907001034 https://findanexpert.unimelb.edu.au/scholarlywork/297367-spatial-structure-of-the-frequency-doubling-illusion http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17481693 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81104937.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2007.03.013,17481693,10.1016/j.visres.2007.03.013,1985542009,,0,002-362-677-281-82X; 003-854-939-793-153; 004-171-362-609-772; 005-001-376-168-992; 006-182-921-845-082; 009-863-224-755-121; 010-225-321-126-756; 011-904-904-143-698; 011-968-098-818-744; 012-717-610-873-743; 017-829-990-035-538; 019-715-295-889-344; 027-372-503-647-306; 030-957-394-406-942; 033-545-480-454-439; 034-685-070-423-091; 036-330-287-394-324; 038-727-677-768-465; 040-836-628-884-405; 053-893-560-716-650; 056-353-221-414-377; 060-537-911-465-893; 065-542-676-261-089; 076-000-066-055-571; 080-058-521-909-804; 098-925-152-069-980; 099-850-902-437-555; 107-758-455-605-33X; 113-887-021-044-422; 141-191-472-432-002; 142-793-174-042-588; 185-200-260-254-046; 188-178-083-685-072,6

Raath; D. Norman; I. McGregor; Richard Dashwood; Darren J. Hughes,"Press-hardened boron steel has been utilized in anti-intrusion systems in automobiles, providing high strength and weight-saving potential through gage reduction. Boron steel spot welds exhibit a soft heat-affected zone which is surrounded by a hard nugget and outlying base material. This soft zone reduces the strength of the weld and makes it susceptible to failure. Additionally, different welding regimes lead to significantly different hardness distributions, making failure prediction difficult. Boron steel sheets, welded with fixed and adaptive schedules, were characterized. These are the first experimentally determined residual stress distributions for boron steel resistance spot welds which have been reported. Residual strains were measured using neutron diffraction, and the hardness distributions were measured on the same welds. Additionally, similar measurements were performed on spot welded DP600 steel as a reference material. A correspondence between residual stress and hardness profiles was observed for all welds. A significant difference in material properties was observed between the fixed schedule and adaptively welded boron steel samples, which could potentially lead to a difference in failure loads between the two boron steel welds.",48,6,2900,2914,Spot welding; Residual; Metallurgy; Materials science; Welding; Significant difference; Material properties; Residual stress; Boron; Neutron diffraction,,,,,https://paperity.org/p/79553115/effect-of-weld-schedule-on-the-residual-stress-distribution-of-boron-steel-spot-welds http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MMTA...48.2900R/abstract https://pureportal.coventry.ac.uk/en/publications/effect-of-weld-schedule-on-the-residual-stress-distribution-of-bo https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs11661-017-4079-9.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/81920318 http://wrap.warwick.ac.uk/88030/ https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81920318.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9,,10.1007/s11661-017-4079-9,2597858579,,0,003-599-203-542-233; 006-580-663-504-034; 009-568-240-047-342; 009-962-146-867-913; 015-208-598-760-044; 019-966-643-516-971; 023-407-633-563-25X; 029-957-314-850-205; 040-701-666-895-641; 044-719-426-526-303; 047-773-796-991-743; 050-888-254-620-997; 056-975-423-369-419; 057-548-910-727-922; 062-575-562-329-067; 084-992-952-524-357; 090-006-510-330-889; 097-729-408-724-746; 102-792-696-415-657; 106-981-564-922-882; 107-120-627-880-31X; 111-428-782-725-219; 120-570-723-942-372; 124-373-969-562-241; 136-673-280-450-370; 142-263-466-225-361; 148-482-536-887-669; 148-817-624-193-466; 160-379-085-701-827; 161-001-730-168-650; 176-733-334-872-476; 182-570-153-714-376; 182-813-876-392-722; 184-671-405-260-071,2

The basic problem is how the game should be evaluated: it has no expectation and hence no well-defined value. Easwaran (2008) has shown that the Pasadena game does have a weak expectation, raising the possibility that we can eliminate the value gap by requiring agents to value gambles at their weak expectations (where they exist). In this paper, I first prove a negative result: there are gambles like the Pasadena game that do not even have a weak expectation. Hence, problematic value gaps remain even if decision theory is extended to take in weak expectations. There is a further challenge: the existence of a ‘value gap’ in the Pasadena game seems to make decision theory inapplicable in a number of cases where the right choice is obvious. The positive contribution of the paper is a theory of ‘relative utilities’, an extension of decision theory that lets us make comparative judgements even among gambles that have no well-defined value.",125,499,799,827,Epistemology; Mathematical economics; Economics; Decision theory,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/BARMDW https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5649904 https://mind.oxfordjournals.org/content/125/499/799.abstract https://academic.oup.com/mind/article/125/499/799/2563363,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/mind/fzv152,,10.1093/mind/fzv152,2478576108,,0,003-215-574-891-955; 003-704-208-147-496; 004-253-147-368-282; 006-840-861-065-448; 010-020-267-730-645; 010-306-032-161-306; 016-764-603-940-212; 024-754-228-568-308; 027-151-445-156-912; 031-430-499-046-053; 047-862-315-771-85X; 062-508-677-263-897; 064-004-591-528-00X; 090-721-258-243-734; 100-092-259-619-002; 104-466-984-919-787; 105-688-345-312-903; 143-829-935-168-942; 148-408-593-620-682; 164-980-227-057-006; 177-162-865-921-863; 182-664-322-815-248; 193-515-011-759-787,7

The purpose of this paper is to investigate the effects of this intervention and explain how this intervention succeeded in establishing a professional learning community.,A mixed method design was used to answer the research questions. Quantitative analysis of comparative judgement data provided insight into the effects of the intervention. More specifically was analysed whether examiners judged more in line after the intervention. Qualitative analysis of the conversations within the intervention served to examine how interdependent examiners behaved in the professionalisation exercises and to gain insight into how a professional learning community was established.,The analysis showed that the intervention of the Flemish Examination Centre facilitated the formation of a professional learning community. This was visible in the quantitative analysis.

In the human neuroimaging literature, two signatures of bi-dimensional cognitive maps have been reported: the grid-like code and the distance-dependent code. While these kinds of representation were previously observed during spatial navigation and, more recently, during processing of perceptual stimuli, it is still an open question whether they also underlie the representation of the most basic items of language: words. Here we taught human participants the meaning of novel words as arbitrary labels for a set of audiovisual objects varying orthogonally in size and sound. The novel words were therefore conceivable as points in a navigable 2D map of meaning. While subjects performed a word comparison task, we recorded their brain activity using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). By applying a combination of representational similarity and fMRI-adaptation analyses, we found evidence of (i) a grid-like code, in the right postero-medial entorhinal cortex, representing the relative angular positions of words in the word space, and (ii) a distance-dependent code, in medial prefrontal, orbitofrontal, and mid-cingulate cortices, representing the Euclidean distance between words. Additionally, we found evidence that the brain also separately represents the single dimensions of word meaning: their implied size, encoded in visual areas, and their implied sound, in Heschl's gyrus/Insula. These results support the idea that the meaning of words, when they are organized along two dimensions, is represented in the human brain across multiple maps of different dimensionality. Significant statement How do we represent the meaning of words and perform comparative judgements on them in our brain? According to influential theories, concepts are conceivable as points of an internal map (where distance represents similarity) that, as the physical space, can be mentally navigated. Here we use fMRI to show that when humans compare newly learnt words, they recruit a grid-like and a distance code, the same types of neural codes that, in mammals, represent relations between locations in the environment and support physical navigation between them.",232,,117876,,Insula; Euclidean distance; Brain activity and meditation; Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Cognitive map; Natural language processing; Perception; Functional magnetic resonance imaging; Computer science; Spatial memory,Distance code; Entorhinal cortex; Grid-like code; Navigation; Words; vmPFC,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1053811921001531,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,33636346,10.1016/j.neuroimage.2021.117876,3130613096,,0,002-361-179-653-833; 003-028-967-630-066; 004-478-535-703-270; 006-613-053-767-871; 006-692-383-377-268; 007-132-867-143-709; 011-538-156-264-314; 013-165-492-805-03X; 013-213-970-419-250; 014-024-068-398-452; 014-210-555-069-030; 016-414-813-050-875; 021-736-694-082-286; 024-189-717-981-292; 031-293-580-765-647; 033-287-870-710-726; 033-442-984-511-466; 034-024-375-481-50X; 034-874-174-893-488; 036-735-214-067-934; 039-248-614-176-559; 040-543-839-617-519; 041-222-456-792-220; 041-294-666-539-760; 042-966-784-480-742; 043-890-715-351-494; 044-264-243-301-461; 049-940-851-911-477; 051-281-955-014-071; 054-630-926-268-365; 056-105-599-056-361; 056-576-148-142-317; 063-433-869-352-088; 065-077-486-249-213; 067-879-125-389-808; 068-910-911-949-197; 070-297-699-153-640; 073-008-629-758-949; 074-792-812-248-435; 076-045-489-927-422; 076-529-940-900-699; 082-244-347-583-942; 082-541-909-852-077; 092-923-598-568-103; 113-973-431-964-847; 116-599-876-467-271; 121-943-242-529-339; 132-577-677-705-698; 139-614-088-148-146; 154-068-214-565-994; 154-541-474-697-636; 160-414-603-840-810; 170-359-567-943-583,0

Yet in today's Europe it risks being marginalised amidst the actions and rhetoric of emergency – a norm to be waived in a state of exception, leaving decisions of lasting consequence shielded from public debate. A German constitutional theorist once famously defined as sovereign the one who has the power to declare the state of exception, and linked this power closely to executive suspensions of the law. The European setting invites a different understanding of an emergency regime: one that is manifest in the contravention of norms which may or may not be legally codified, and which is collectively produced by multiple actors. The persistence of politics in the emergency register indicates precisely the weakness of political authority. The article goes on to examine how exceptional this exceptionalism is. Is Europe's emergency politics a recent phenomenon, or has it been one of the currents of European integration from the beginning",63,2,300,318,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16672692.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/1467-9248.12072,,10.1111/1467-9248.12072,,,0,000-374-554-384-250; 003-248-594-846-407; 004-651-428-567-10X; 011-555-082-343-777; 014-521-753-796-536; 014-673-643-711-266; 016-100-769-932-755; 019-683-078-582-22X; 023-832-312-441-208; 024-619-228-222-145; 025-289-306-867-975; 030-552-064-801-223; 030-887-766-120-419; 036-684-170-567-875; 039-549-301-210-25X; 047-641-038-550-231; 055-750-486-685-01X; 057-325-880-313-412; 059-256-070-737-156; 063-551-035-048-693; 063-655-059-000-201; 071-115-973-247-663; 077-092-195-330-960; 080-066-923-417-183; 091-035-073-296-81X; 105-803-216-418-278; 109-246-047-050-535; 109-936-059-976-931; 127-156-159-060-408; 128-562-789-856-996; 130-093-948-027-822; 136-945-970-382-914; 153-574-792-145-479; 163-657-196-952-49X; 169-805-817-610-805; 174-603-965-941-097; 183-918-739-708-521,88

This raises the possibility that the inferred stimulus-driven regulation of lateralized motor reactivity described by SIA, which was against the one expected on the basis of a valence-specific lateral bias, was entirely due to attentional capture from motivational significance (beyond numerical cognition). In order to establish the relevance of numerical cognition on the regulation of attentional capture we ran two complementary experiments. These involved the same direct comparison task on stimulus pairs that were fully comparable in terms of their analog representation of intensity but with different representational domain and motivational significance: symbolic magnitudes with low motivational significance in experiment 1 vs. emotions with rather high motivational significance in experiment 2. The results reveal a general SIA and point to a general mechanism regulating comparative judgements. This is based on the way spatial attention is captured toward locations that contain the stimulus which is closest in term of relative intensity to the extremal values of the series, regardless from its representational domain being it symbolic or emotional.",,,1,20,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Face perception; Cognitive psychology; Psychological research; Facial expression; Judgement; Relative intensity; Numerical cognition; Magnitude (mathematics),,,,Università degli Studi di Trieste (RESRIC-FANTONI2018),https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32166368 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/19181 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3 https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2964357,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3,32166368,10.1007/s00426-020-01306-3,3010538513,,0,000-455-372-559-296; 000-554-668-882-790; 001-736-503-518-484; 001-995-708-037-242; 003-086-472-590-707; 003-683-845-316-328; 003-846-053-882-35X; 004-381-286-146-379; 004-451-533-015-01X; 004-731-567-191-050; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-402-735-113-601; 008-192-712-366-191; 008-323-657-407-735; 009-638-275-134-279; 009-804-637-120-597; 010-176-051-981-120; 010-187-743-570-895; 012-627-787-071-501; 012-765-147-718-763; 013-621-028-229-557; 013-783-022-449-657; 014-347-760-732-628; 014-477-778-845-298; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-264-055-000-686; 015-334-468-316-778; 015-803-870-149-321; 016-000-197-860-064; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-286-539-418-329; 016-374-298-162-237; 016-585-695-878-191; 017-029-116-133-38X; 017-096-212-135-705; 017-797-479-052-054; 018-765-388-536-256; 018-781-528-222-92X; 019-131-039-088-768; 021-566-111-190-893; 022-396-094-696-709; 025-703-813-430-701; 025-957-847-646-05X; 025-971-418-331-624; 027-012-971-940-520; 029-915-293-337-721; 032-049-177-406-929; 035-229-209-474-238; 035-522-074-408-50X; 036-459-179-538-121; 038-395-026-012-885; 039-762-466-320-740; 039-941-560-998-113; 046-522-618-604-832; 047-527-075-662-356; 048-939-869-477-889; 049-863-149-640-914; 050-728-327-300-677; 051-066-076-538-547; 053-591-751-927-115; 054-100-154-295-161; 054-649-302-531-591; 056-170-806-678-309; 057-183-336-446-253; 058-175-340-486-49X; 061-215-565-452-575; 061-556-739-571-730; 063-223-495-189-224; 066-608-905-207-154; 067-036-764-376-645; 067-715-519-706-692; 068-090-664-463-999; 073-811-902-344-708; 074-268-500-538-942; 077-955-155-009-954; 078-120-813-645-612; 078-649-785-249-179; 081-260-990-315-81X; 087-228-473-950-231; 087-300-622-382-439; 090-473-073-536-194; 097-118-699-603-908; 100-668-664-094-130; 101-033-639-064-930; 105-942-707-129-817; 106-197-189-659-701; 107-103-350-803-295; 114-992-167-812-755; 117-754-333-941-321; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-791-951-129-93X; 123-478-664-171-99X; 123-593-345-103-90X; 125-126-582-214-822; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 139-708-795-933-36X; 141-730-925-182-377; 149-229-185-800-505; 167-388-826-583-987; 175-397-495-157-485; 177-015-691-281-199; 196-022-041-043-935,1

According to Sen transcendental theories of justice are unnecessary. What we aim at is to justify a series of comparative judgements about two or more states of affairs.We do not strive, unlike Rawls, to form a complete system of moral principles that backs an «ideal just society». I try to show that Sen’s «comparative» account is weak. First of all, Sen does not offer a fair interpretation of Rawls’ theory. In particular, he is wrong when he depicts Rawls’ justice as fairness as a complete and transcendental moral doctrine. Secondly, Sen overlooks the fact that in order to justify comparative evaluations of states of affairs we must assume as valid a particular moral doctrine. Finally I try to solve the problem about the contrast between transcendental and comparative account by offering a transcendental outlook to questions of justice that is, at the same time, pluralist and incomplete.",0,42,183,197,Epistemology; Philosophy; Transcendental number; Pluralism (political theory); Doctrine; Moral particularism; Just society; Political philosophy,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Francesco_Biondo/publication/49614526_Qu_podemos_pedir_a_una_teora_de_la_justicia_Algunas_consideraciones_acerca_de_un_debate_entre_Amartya_Sen_y_John_Rawls/links/00b4952b863182117f000000.pdf https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=3308841 http://isegoria.revistas.csic.es/index.php/isegoria/article/view/690 http://www.acuedi.org/ddata/11248.pdf https://doaj.org/article/4b981ec1f2134c5e8e79b3e1ec926587 http://isegoria.revistas.csic.es/index.php/isegoria/article/viewFile/690/692,http://dx.doi.org/10.3989/isegoria.2010.i42.690,,10.3989/isegoria.2010.i42.690,2090090139,,0,,1

Lötter,"In this article I respond to the thoughtful criticisms of my book articulated by Gillian Brock, Thaddeus Metz, and Darrel Moellendorf. Their critical questioning offers me an opportunity to reformulate aspects of the book so that I more accurately say exactly what I had in mind when writing the book. The first section contains a reworking of my definition of poverty to eliminate any ambiguity and demonstrate what kind of comparative judgements the definition allows us to make. The second section looks anew at the multiple moral sources for our obligation to eradicate poverty. In the third section I focus on issues that could hinder attempts at eradicating poverty. One is the lack of accessible knowledge that might be too demanding to acquire. The other is the possibility that all attempts to eradicate poverty might have to be put on hold until oppressive capitalist development has prepared the circumstances for a more socialist distribution of resources. I argue that neither of these concerns should hinder the eradication of poverty.",22,3,343,361,Political strategy; Sociology; Culture of poverty; Poverty; Law and economics; Law; Moral obligation; Obligation; Ambiguity; Socialism; Political philosophy,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11158-016-9319-0 https://philpapers.org/rec/LTTPEA,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s11158-016-9319-0,,10.1007/s11158-016-9319-0,2428456417,,0,001-693-778-961-664; 003-678-843-665-843; 005-707-110-338-960; 015-255-233-265-843; 019-501-932-259-203; 019-787-096-946-150; 027-373-898-385-594; 028-057-436-911-475; 031-932-599-343-40X; 034-989-779-509-565; 037-188-432-160-615; 043-596-645-193-066; 052-032-766-046-495; 057-769-755-943-543; 060-729-334-082-257; 063-593-689-310-991; 089-883-878-301-479; 091-052-060-622-895; 093-348-717-142-200; 102-192-055-355-843; 111-726-061-359-752; 117-601-700-444-259; 126-733-179-162-656; 131-847-119-748-360; 136-001-333-455-940; 149-870-096-763-89X; 153-395-694-996-241; 154-642-333-826-10X; 191-051-891-012-538; 194-011-188-196-964,3

Dzhafarov,"We develop a mathematical theory for comparative sorites, considered in terms of a system mapping pairs of stimuli into a binary response characteristic whose values supervene on stimulus pairs and are interpretable as the complementary relations ‘are the same’ and ‘are not the same’ (overall or in some respect). Comparative sorites is about hypothetical sequences of stimuli in which every two successive elements are mapped into the relation ‘are the same’, while the pair comprised of the first and the last elements of the sequence is mapped into ‘are not the same’. Although soritical sequences of this kind are logically possible, we argue that their existence is grounded in no empirical evidence and show that it is excluded by a certain psychophysical principle proposed for human comparative judgements in a context unrelated to soritical issues.

Many healthcare systems wish to foster transparency and accountability in the decisions they make by incorporating the public in decision-making processes. This paper presents a unique conceptual approach exploring the public’s preferences for health service innovations by viewing healthcare innovations as ‘bundles’ of characteristics. This decompositional approach allows policy-makers to compare numerous competing health service innovations without repeatedly administering surveys for specific innovation choices. Methods: A Discrete Choice Experiment (DCE) was used to elicit preferences. Individuals chose from presented innovation options that they believe the UK National Health Service (NHS) should invest the most in. Innovations differed according to: (i) target population; (ii) target age; (iii) implementation time; (iv) uncertainty associated with their likely effects; (v) potential health benefits; and, (vi) cost to a taxpayer. This approach fosters multidimensional decision-making, rather than imposing a single decision criterion (e.g., cost, target age) in prioritisation. Choice data was then analysed using scale-adjusted Latent Class models to investigate variability in preferences and scale and valuations amongst respondents. Results: Three latent classes with considerable heterogeneity in the preferences were present. Each latent class is composed of two consumer subgroups varying in the level of certainty in their choices. All groups preferred scientifically proven innovations, those with potential health benefits that cost less. There were, however, some important differences in their preferences for innovation investment choices: Class-1 (54%) prefers innovations benefitting adults and young people and does not prefer innovations targeting people with ‘drug addiction’ and ‘obesity’. Class- 2 (34%) prefers innovations targeting ‘cancer’ patients only and has negative preferences for innovations targeting elderly, and Class-3 (12%) prefers spending on elderly and cancer patients the most. Conclusions: DCE can help policy-makers incorporate public preferences for health service innovation investment choices into decision making. The findings provide useful information on the public’s valuation and acceptability of potential health service innovations. Such information can be used to guide innovation prioritisation decisions by comparing competing innovation options.

Vibrotactile perception was assessed using sinusoidal amplitude-modulated vibratory stimuli of constant energy level (r.m.s. acceleration, 0.41 m/s2) having a carrier frequency of 26 Hz (i.e. engine firing frequency) and modulation frequency of 6.5 Hz (half-order engine harmonic). Evaluations of seven levels of modulation depth parameter m(0.0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, and 1.0) were performed in order to define the growth function of human perceived disturbance as a function of amplitude modulation depth. Two semantic descriptors were used (unpleasantness and roughness) and two test methods (the Thurstone paired-comparison method and the Borg CR-10 direct evaluation scale) for a total of four tests. Each test was performed using an independent group of 25 individuals. The results suggest that there is a critical value of modulation depth m = ...",219,4,499,510,Acceleration; Frequency modulation; Harmonic; Idle; Vibration; Amplitude modulation; Acoustics; Steering wheel; Diesel engine; Mathematics; Simulation,,,,,https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/bitstream/2438/10109/4/Fulltext.pdf https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1243/095440705x11167 https://bura.brunel.ac.uk/handle/2438/10109,http://dx.doi.org/10.1243/095440705x11167,,10.1243/095440705x11167,2071924341,,0,017-065-763-368-87X; 018-080-976-195-572; 030-968-470-245-372; 031-002-904-217-75X; 032-804-552-835-634; 033-928-291-284-547; 037-438-844-942-540; 038-011-943-725-502; 039-210-125-011-856; 039-628-185-013-763; 047-340-031-579-462; 057-541-461-565-54X; 058-443-847-087-250; 058-531-954-531-310; 060-256-246-533-970; 071-757-670-268-664; 071-838-735-842-79X; 087-160-537-421-518; 090-948-927-470-333; 091-420-983-350-417; 101-594-304-901-514; 120-452-742-727-152; 128-790-217-313-78X; 138-811-758-865-301; 152-671-577-558-252; 158-206-115-597-809; 159-388-686-613-936; 176-117-558-209-180,10

There have been significant changes in the approaches to teaching and learning in higher education with the advent of MOOCs, flipped classroom approaches, the introduction of informal learning spaces, the gamification of learning and the expectation of more flexible modes of delivery. We have not seen as much activity in the assessment area to align these changes in teaching with how we use assessment (Guardia, in press). Technology has promoted changes in our understanding of how curricula might be designed and delivered but new approaches to assessment are still needed. Usercentred approaches to assessment involving authentic assessment tasks are now being discussed more often (Mora, Sancho-Bru, Iserte, & Sanchez, 2012; Mueller, 2014). This special edition captures some of the recent investigations in e-assessment that move us beyond the traditional selected response formats of multiple-choice tests, short answer, fill-in-the-blanks, true-false, and matching. Higher-level cognitive and affective skills cannot readily be assessed using traditional selected response formats and more authentic e-assessments are being proposed (Kuh, Jankowski, Ikenberry, & Kinzie 2014). The paper by James explores the outcomes of a trial of an online final examination in a first year distance education psychology course invigilated via webcam. The study argued for the need to deliver better high stakes assessment to distance education students in a way that aimed to enhance convenience for students while maintaining the validity of the testing process. In this study about one quarter of students in the trial were initially enthusiastic however it was not until they had completed a practice online invigilated exam that the majority of these elected to decline the online approach to their final examination. The paper summarises the process and the concerns of students with this type of assessment. The findings demonstrated the importance of complex contextual matters such as technology compatibility, network reliability, clear communication, logistics and support available for students when implementing new computerised approaches to high stakes assessment. The paper by Gil-Jaurena and Kucina outlines the TALOE (Time to Assess Learning Outcomes in E-learning) project that developed a web tool for teachers so that they could make informed choices on how to assess online courses.

In a case study concerning food quality attributes of chicken breast filets, we find evidence of ordering effects in a sequence of 16 choice sets, where the last 8 choice sets are identical to the first 8. The overall preference structure is found to differ significantly between the two identical sequences of choice sets, and significant increases in marginal WTP are found for two out of four attributes. We find a reduction in the error variance for the last 8 choice sets relative to the first 8 choice sets. In particular, this difference is ascribed to the first choice set obtaining a significantly higher error variance than all succeeding choice sets, suggesting institutional learning rather than preference learning effects underlying the observed ordering effect. This is further supported by the fact that the differences in WTP become insignificant when removing the first choice set from the analysis. We find no evidence of fatigue, and we argue that our findings cannot be explained by starting point or strategic behavior effects.",5,2,19,37,Econometrics; Economics; Choice set; Preference learning; Error variance; Strategic behavior; Institutional learning; Chicken breast,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514 https://gupea.ub.gu.se/bitstream/2077/23769/1/gupea_2077_23769_1.pdf http://www.icmconference.org.uk/index.php/icmc/ICMC2011/paper/view/281 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700514 https://gupea.ub.gu.se/handle/2077/23769 https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/66841 https://www.forskningsdatabasen.dk/catalog/2549747243 https://portal.findresearcher.sdu.dk/da/publications/the-first-time-is-the-hardest-a-test-of-ordering-effects-in-choic https://www.economics.handels.gu.se/digitalAssets/1445/1445644_jcm-2012.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82375966.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70051-4,,10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70051-4,1504476705,,0,000-473-076-666-811; 002-182-787-085-215; 006-339-706-723-472; 007-882-134-399-654; 010-221-964-938-581; 011-533-127-161-292; 012-033-003-071-864; 017-111-352-560-976; 019-792-526-204-891; 021-694-571-951-135; 022-454-770-002-120; 023-188-069-993-218; 028-864-828-247-228; 031-810-415-073-770; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-778-764-795-063; 039-458-058-680-804; 042-998-017-618-583; 044-386-297-822-639; 046-292-238-288-021; 046-522-033-816-151; 056-306-008-250-391; 057-657-809-679-383; 060-375-428-941-483; 061-441-838-070-43X; 062-345-124-074-46X; 063-745-188-026-319; 064-235-859-755-296; 069-584-139-587-21X; 073-125-290-693-818; 074-071-861-181-580; 074-236-575-939-517; 081-567-835-944-997; 084-620-154-173-76X; 088-902-572-148-592; 100-440-892-234-712; 103-027-645-446-531; 107-781-135-837-372; 107-937-677-557-525; 109-978-804-265-036; 110-918-754-580-61X; 112-258-103-767-706; 112-822-906-532-331; 113-059-561-380-183; 115-678-995-328-02X; 120-856-193-188-774; 132-914-230-472-749; 137-700-671-939-277; 150-691-699-172-556; 154-369-567-201-976; 164-260-106-908-120; 184-039-891-540-554; 188-592-643-972-920; 193-466-601-325-93X; 197-061-894-348-472,82

Yet, valid and reliable measures of proof comprehension remain rare. In this article, we present a study investigating proof comprehension via students’ summaries of a given proof. These summaries were evaluated by expert judges making pairwise comparisons, which were used to generate a score for each summary. This approach, known as comparative judgement, has been demonstrated to generate reliable and valid scores when assessing other mathematical constructs. Our findings suggest that comparative judgement can produce valid and reliable assessments of the quality of student-produced proof summaries. We also explored which features of students’ proof summaries were most valued by the expert judges, and found that high-scoring summaries referenced a proof’s logical structure and the mechanism by which it reached a contradiction.",105,2,181,197,Artificial intelligence; Pairwise comparison; Structure (mathematical logic); Natural language processing; Judgement; Contradiction; Comprehension,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Comparative_judgement_proof_summaries_and_proof_comprehension/12936137 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x,,10.1007/s10649-020-09984-x,3091030379,,0,005-534-847-537-136; 005-946-820-946-248; 016-279-152-792-986; 018-269-445-638-29X; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-886-709-886-069; 026-318-747-461-037; 035-375-011-253-259; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-550-015-414-716; 040-241-846-826-833; 045-673-327-913-653; 047-410-827-372-679; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 052-556-386-273-247; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-022-905-420-746; 069-370-358-754-90X; 073-116-065-897-65X; 076-163-610-880-070; 078-719-290-790-749; 080-111-772-128-72X; 080-193-587-992-227; 087-814-704-580-867; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-790-299-676-96X; 090-794-868-877-416; 095-339-879-052-599; 098-742-019-688-692; 100-403-081-167-218; 104-581-513-132-471; 117-467-871-744-796; 120-249-326-102-774; 122-448-167-938-324; 126-454-221-798-016; 128-903-523-677-504; 149-433-841-504-551; 163-379-589-157-078; 166-315-357-513-375; 174-885-774-292-15X; 176-786-786-040-880; 183-648-179-920-825; 194-531-401-693-345,1

Even after great effort there is a small chance independent raters would agree on their mutual ratings which undermines the reliability of the rating. Several assessment methods and their merits are described in literature, among them the use of rubrics and the use of comparative judgement (CJ). In this study we investigate which of the two methods is more efficient in obtaining reliable outcomes when used for assessing texts. The same 12 texts are assessed in both a rubric and CJ condition by the same 6 raters. Results show an inter-rater reliability of .30 for the rubric condition and an inter-rater reliability of .84 in the CJ condition after the same amount of time invested in the respective methods. Therefore we conclude that CJ is far more efficient in obtaining high reliabilities when used to asses texts.

009-845-548-351-730,Private technical and vocational education and training (TVET) and national development : The South African reality,2008-12-01,2008,dissertation,,,,,Salim Akoojee,"This thesis examines the extent to which the private Technical and Vocational Education and Training (TVET) Sector in South Africa is responsive to national development. National development is understood as associated with a range of socioeconomic imperatives which include challenges of poverty, unemployment, inequality, the ravages of the HIV/AIDS pandemic and its associated impacts. In addition to these, the educational component of national development is to ensure access, redress and equity, which are necessary to undo the impacts of an apartheid-related skills regime. Skills development is considered a crucial means to respond to these challenges. Without skills for formal and informal labour markets, as well as productive self-employment, South Africa’s capacity to respond to the new globalised era is likely to be considerably stunted and will negatively affect its developmental trajectory. The methodology used in this study included a mix of quantitative and qualitative strategies to obtain the size, shape and nature of provision. The quantitative component, undertaken in the course of 2002, was supplemented by randomly chosen qualitative case studies. Together, they provided the basis for unravelling a sector distinct in nature, form and content. Developing a comprehensive typology provides important insight into responsiveness of a sector characterised by wide-ranging provision forms. The typology of provider type based on profitability and form, i.e. ‘for-profit’, ‘non-profit’ and ‘in-house’ providers, was replaced with a multi-dimensional model. Learner type, as a primary typological category, includes the ‘pre-employed’, ‘unemployed’, the employed ‘selffunded employee’ and the ‘corporate client’. Provider types responding to these learner types are distinguished on the basis of location, delivery patterns and programming. The various provider forms include ‘multi-providers’, ‘specialist providers’, ‘consultants’, ‘in-house’ and ‘non-profit’ providers. Provider purposes include those responding to employment, either formal labour market or selfemployment, and self-development, including leisure-related skilling and lifelong learning. Learner types and training purpose determine the manner, form and characteristics of provision. This understanding of a widely divergent and heterogeneous sector provides the context for assessing its contribution to national development in South Africa. The notions of responsiveness and receptiveness are used as conceptual devices to assess the role of the sector. Responsiveness describes specific labour market purpose, while receptiveness refers to the social development and educational imperatives of access, redress and equity. The sheer size of the sector suggests an important demand-led element of provision and represents an important measure of receptiveness to national development prerogatives. The conservative estimate of 706 884 learners, located at 4178 sites for 864 providers that pre-registered with the Department of Education in 2001, provide the basis for serious consideration of the sector. The sector adequately responds to the immediate short-term needs of employers. Programmes offered for corporate providers respond more deliberately to their immediate short-term skill requirements and which has made it possible for them to outsource a considerable proportion of their training. In addition, there is no other education and training form flexible enough to provide for the training needs of employees, and sometimes the customers of corporate concerns, as in product upgrading and support, at times and locations suitable to their requirements. Private providers did not necessarily have more linkages with the formal labour market than do public providers and are not necessarily able to secure more effectively employment opportunities for their preand unemployed learners With respect to receptiveness, the sector comprises learner patterns consistent with national demographics. The sector is associated with an older, employed learner type, typically enrolled in shorter-term courses. This demonstrates the sector’s accessibility. In comparison with their public counterparts, costs were not prohibitive and programme structure allowed adequate flexibility to enable learners to weave in and out of the system. Variable admission requirements also allowed learners to slot into appropriate levels. The absence of data makes comparative judgements of throughput, and quality, with public institutions difficult to make. The current need to regulate all providers equally may not be the most efficient way of dealing with the sector. In light of the national development prerogative to protect those most vulnerable from the risk of market failure, there is need to grant support to those providers most responsive to this group in this instance, those ‘full time’ providers responding to the preand unemployed learner set. The market adequately regulates providers responding to the employed and corporate client groups.",,,,,Lifelong learning; Higher education; Comparative education; Marketing; Political science; Market failure; Further education; Full-time; Medical education; Vocational education; Education policy,,,,,http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/10539/5855/1/Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf http://www.lmip.org.za/sites/default/files/documentfiles//Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/5855/Akoojee%20Thesis%20-%20Final%20-%20070926.pdf?sequence=1 http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/5855 http://wiredspace.wits.ac.za/bitstream/handle/10539/5855/Thesis%20Abstract%20-%20Akoojee%20-%20Private%20TVET%20in%20South%20Africa%20-%20070925.pdf?sequence=2,http://mobile.wiredspace.wits.ac.za/handle/10539/5855,,,161485479,,0,003-248-749-057-50X; 003-803-083-053-309; 005-238-254-302-028; 005-842-010-761-931; 007-075-755-402-763; 007-424-165-576-90X; 007-760-651-139-150; 008-568-541-949-263; 009-556-825-348-644; 010-027-967-887-346; 010-835-000-813-211; 011-400-374-092-934; 011-720-031-328-928; 012-898-575-910-427; 012-934-742-034-766; 013-098-346-613-219; 013-531-207-839-917; 013-532-095-802-259; 014-015-335-346-303; 014-458-119-298-565; 015-328-778-235-139; 016-832-453-582-131; 019-175-648-768-552; 019-625-357-734-868; 020-884-523-153-420; 022-098-013-428-433; 022-837-775-020-609; 023-489-770-028-28X; 023-846-976-381-356; 024-403-493-304-077; 024-771-845-884-511; 024-781-812-756-555; 025-534-896-497-818; 026-061-422-094-928; 026-069-188-943-894; 026-108-196-216-143; 026-550-711-985-935; 027-610-501-516-151; 027-805-988-872-309; 029-633-599-758-320; 030-506-989-758-952; 030-988-749-595-247; 031-053-000-227-883; 032-323-918-734-014; 033-077-701-739-952; 035-836-484-283-115; 036-415-520-040-489; 037-207-192-092-481; 037-795-985-384-058; 037-925-340-936-073; 038-206-569-175-730; 044-900-626-955-176; 046-699-951-199-264; 046-704-908-225-82X; 047-297-779-929-521; 048-390-030-542-07X; 049-522-829-827-066; 049-940-818-221-968; 050-882-428-673-929; 055-498-815-134-39X; 056-999-656-921-83X; 057-426-773-373-922; 057-902-590-156-620; 059-056-207-712-050; 059-404-026-983-407; 059-528-247-337-243; 060-224-640-529-383; 060-602-217-718-705; 063-102-656-135-016; 065-601-835-403-628; 069-423-915-534-392; 070-365-824-959-398; 071-837-551-305-725; 072-383-696-023-828; 072-606-577-555-878; 072-966-930-008-082; 073-456-592-782-433; 075-721-244-547-709; 077-304-473-075-763; 077-319-547-848-602; 077-424-712-197-132; 078-092-385-115-141; 079-044-108-102-385; 079-301-735-154-779; 083-330-782-905-51X; 083-416-194-421-09X; 083-876-259-634-350; 085-985-560-943-705; 086-939-296-774-437; 086-998-976-774-246; 087-361-238-973-663; 088-158-357-054-072; 088-737-814-154-615; 089-275-894-774-998; 089-438-882-469-295; 090-093-093-993-750; 091-461-418-513-253; 091-917-040-798-180; 092-243-611-241-086; 092-595-071-557-037; 095-430-098-687-732; 095-747-067-487-557; 096-004-694-181-468; 096-483-223-507-936; 097-649-685-266-085; 098-542-838-860-066; 099-574-517-934-100; 099-953-330-898-859; 100-020-968-222-62X; 100-767-382-538-470; 101-956-860-174-755; 105-185-008-792-200; 108-300-923-259-418; 108-551-892-616-975; 109-486-136-864-373; 110-015-055-680-841; 110-655-919-945-196; 111-611-261-421-813; 113-756-265-658-05X; 115-362-694-789-411; 115-830-728-532-142; 115-962-520-020-636; 117-595-144-173-807; 117-988-761-272-189; 120-743-615-928-349; 121-692-780-793-846; 123-413-478-565-429; 124-229-501-413-383; 125-752-607-193-924; 127-207-783-508-023; 127-453-406-774-151; 129-031-891-944-89X; 130-876-592-820-264; 131-201-234-130-563; 133-062-025-614-647; 134-330-632-476-201; 137-417-499-050-869; 137-537-032-167-154; 138-155-384-325-219; 140-003-432-827-301; 140-947-679-897-406; 141-779-615-430-061; 141-901-222-242-592; 142-558-363-458-259; 143-152-433-421-184; 146-149-601-808-92X; 148-963-699-927-474; 153-007-468-551-706; 155-615-432-207-956; 156-987-810-060-757; 157-165-666-735-791; 157-562-281-143-911; 160-100-417-919-961; 162-603-698-743-727; 164-509-199-251-893; 165-504-597-351-359; 165-828-850-738-030; 165-841-199-671-741; 166-355-657-666-45X; 166-398-070-908-368; 167-660-998-729-049; 169-269-951-035-278; 172-573-079-472-196; 172-999-637-082-271; 173-103-353-695-908; 173-893-282-179-736; 176-667-723-051-951; 176-925-051-081-371; 177-049-087-928-203; 177-173-383-232-09X; 177-347-886-422-503; 178-928-591-197-435; 182-615-753-599-187; 183-664-216-574-934; 185-122-868-787-982; 185-148-560-931-082; 187-986-177-650-232; 190-032-872-808-100; 191-380-857-200-911; 191-519-140-458-791; 192-465-811-777-351; 192-965-728-846-396; 193-342-284-685-047; 193-920-033-952-376; 194-355-556-837-243; 194-711-988-215-075; 195-269-139-186-377; 195-655-868-973-202; 196-817-158-774-095; 198-108-818-551-526,5

It challenges an implicit assumption in much psychological theory and research that creativity exists as an ‘objective’ feature of persons or products, universally recognised and independent of social agreement and cultural systems of norms and beliefs. Focusing on everyday life creative outcomes, the article includes both theoretical accounts and empirical examples from a research exploring creativity evaluations in the context of folk art. In the end, a multi-layered perspective of creativity assessment emerges, integrating dimensions such as newness and originality, value and usefulness, subjective reception and cultural reception of creative products.

The application deals with the design of shop window displays where products should be arranged by teams of vocational students according to aesthetic principles (attributes). </jats:p><jats:p> The photos of the students’ window displays at time 1 (before feedback) and at time 2 (after feedback) were compared by judging each attribute as to whether it was fulfilled better at time 1 or at time 2. An advantage of this PC approach over an alternative of a scoring system is the possibility to assess even subtle changes of various aspects of attractiveness, which cannot easily be measured using a score. To analyse these data, we used earlier work which developed both a multivariate PC pattern model for multi-attribute data and a PC model over time and defined a multivariate PC model of changes (MPCC). The model can be fitted as a non-standard Poisson log-linear model and provides estimates of change for the three attributes for time 2 and we were able to check for possible interaction effects between these attributes. </jats:p>",,,1471082X2199567,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1471082x21995675,,10.1177/1471082x21995675,,,0,000-502-098-255-116; 003-167-463-947-22X; 008-459-485-036-837; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-884-540-656-351; 027-659-055-354-785; 031-057-896-393-179; 041-706-379-743-767; 044-543-500-382-496; 065-660-082-837-308; 077-723-942-563-345; 086-243-451-818-087; 122-376-674-983-517,0

Moloney; Hervé Juin; K. Meteau; Nigel D. Scollan; Ian Richardson; Jean-François Hocquette,"Eating quality of the same meat samples from different animal types cooked at two end-point cooking temperatures (55°C and 74°C) was evaluated by trained panels in France and the United Kingdom. Tenderness and juiciness scores were greater at 55°C than at 74°C, irrespective of the animal type and location of the panel. The UK panel, independently of animal type, gave greater scores for beef flavour (+7 to +24%, P<0.001) but lower scores for abnormal flavour (-10 to -17%, P<0.001) at 74°C. Abnormal flavour score by the French panel was higher at 74°C than at 55°C (+26%, P<0.001). Irrespective of the data set, tenderness was correlated with juiciness and beef flavour. Overall, this study found that cooking beef at a lower temperature increased tenderness and juiciness, irrespective of the location of the panel. In contrast, cooking beef at higher temperatures increased beef flavour and decreased abnormal flavour for the UK panelists but increased abnormal flavour for the French panel.",122,,90,96,Flavour; Red meat; Tenderness; Inter-laboratory; End point; Food handling; Lower temperature; Food science; Medicine,Beef; End-point cooking temperature; Meat sensory qualities; Sensory protocol,Animals; Cattle; Cooking/methods; Female; Food Handling; Food Preferences; France; Humans; Male; Red Meat/analysis; Sensation; Taste; Temperature; United Kingdom,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/160106386 https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/publications/inter-laboratory-assessment-by-trained-panelists-from-france-and- https://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2160/43912 https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/138599126/FranceQuality.pdf https://pure.qub.ac.uk/en/publications/inter-laboratory-assessment-by-trained-panelists-from-france-and- http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016302455 http://research-information.bristol.ac.uk/files/87903160/Revised_Paper_Gagaoua_MEATSCI.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27501233 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0309174016302455 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/72001542.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.07.026,27501233,10.1016/j.meatsci.2016.07.026,2489516506,,0,000-070-360-855-349; 001-936-067-143-888; 002-101-337-944-10X; 002-633-852-786-801; 002-892-200-414-689; 003-358-956-198-476; 003-427-218-567-993; 004-645-203-424-828; 008-854-536-921-183; 013-175-024-768-724; 015-642-721-782-743; 017-008-357-805-930; 019-497-506-701-899; 019-906-797-934-012; 021-232-218-398-782; 023-880-688-651-701; 024-239-743-118-065; 026-313-348-619-033; 027-425-178-927-772; 029-378-081-124-205; 031-184-080-698-043; 033-202-898-508-073; 034-418-444-027-346; 036-078-028-967-165; 037-171-276-258-491; 037-447-082-427-490; 039-025-402-975-035; 041-237-494-993-471; 041-480-064-991-417; 042-340-123-057-133; 043-035-110-451-137; 046-369-437-243-777; 050-162-774-958-171; 050-543-876-353-551; 054-182-799-859-595; 055-028-633-922-030; 057-068-638-436-540; 059-344-241-946-690; 060-977-853-140-28X; 061-342-329-165-218; 062-498-246-071-678; 063-523-161-784-634; 069-779-215-217-801; 070-101-591-821-427; 071-719-529-948-161; 074-330-277-890-592; 077-179-757-482-715; 077-971-300-393-076; 081-532-912-606-36X; 082-589-964-013-922; 083-556-345-149-80X; 085-317-394-317-421; 085-878-345-888-789; 092-690-540-998-595; 097-446-686-307-467; 097-912-294-231-075; 103-949-710-619-744; 109-476-908-419-263; 115-675-751-590-503; 124-847-680-635-982; 129-189-934-321-044; 137-726-816-936-583; 171-478-896-801-189,24

In these experiments, discrimination sensitivity depends on the temporal order of these stimuli (Type B effect) and is usually higher when the standard precedes rather than follows the comparison. Here, we outline how two models of stimulus discrimination can account for the Type B effect, namely the weighted difference model (or basic Sensation Weighting model) and the Internal Reference Model. For both models, the predicted psychometric functions for comparative judgements as well as for equality judgements, in which participants indicate whether they perceived the two stimuli to be equal or not equal, are derived and it is shown that the models also predict a Type B effect for equality judgements. In the empirical part, the models' predictions are evaluated.

(Scripts are typically uploaded to the CompareAssess interface as pdf files and are presented side-by-side.) Repeated comparisons and application of the sorting algorithm leads to scripts sorted in order of merit. Boundaries are determined by separate review of scripts.; A small pilot of ACJ in the fourth year of the Manchester Pharmacy programme is described. Twelve judges used ACJ to mark 64 scripts previously marked conventionally. 50 students peer-marked their own mock examination question using ACJ.; Peer-marking was successful with students learning from the process, and delivering both marks and feedback within two weeks. There was very good consistency among the students acting as judges, and accuracy (as defined by Pollitt, 2012) of 0.94.; Staff were similarly consistent, but the agreement with marks obtained by conventional marking was disappointing. While some discrepancies could be attributed to conventional marking failing under the stress of marking during teaching term, the worst discrepancies appeared to originate from inadequate judging criteria.  ; We conclude that ACJ is a very promising method, especially for peer assessment, but that judging criteria require very careful consideration.",11,1,94,100,Sorting algorithm; Summative assessment; Adaptive comparative judgement; Value judgment; Alternative assessment; Student learning; Computer science; Peer assessment; Scripting language; Applied psychology,,,,,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/download/465/583 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1180133.pdf https://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/465 http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1180133.pdf https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1180133,https://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/465,,,2891993228,,0,,1

Yamanaka; Tadamasa Takemura; K. Nin; Hiroyuki Yoshihara,"Objective: Development of a clinical sensor network system that automatically collects vital sign and its supplemental data, and evaluation the effect of automatic vital sensor value assignment to patients based on locations of sensors. Methods: The sensor network estimates the data-source, a target patient, from the position of a vital sign sensor obtained from a newly developed proximity sensing system. The proximity sensing system estimates the positions of the devices using a Bluetooth inquiry process. Using Bluetooth access points and the positioning system newly developed in this project, the sensor network collects vital sign and its 4W (who, where, what, and when) supplemental data from any Bluetooth ready vital sign sensors such as Continua-ready devices. The prototype was evaluated in a pseudo clinical setting at Kyoto University Hospital using a cyclic paired comparison and statistical analysis. Results: The result of the cyclic paired analysis shows the subjects evaluated the proposed system is more effective and safer than POCS as well as paper-based operation. It halves the times for vital signs input and eliminates input errors. On the other hand, the prototype failed in its position estimation for 12.6% of all attempts, and the nurses overlooked half of the errors. A detailed investigation clears that an advanced interface to show the system’s “confidence”, i.e. the probability of estimation error, must be effective to reduce the oversights. Conclusions: This paper proposed a clinical sensor network system that relieves nurses from vital signs input tasks. The result clearly shows that the proposed system increases the efficiency and safety of the nursing process both subjectively and objectively. It is a step toward new generation of point of nursing care systems where sensors take over the tasks of data input from the nurses.",52,3,239,249,Automation; Ubiquitous computing; Wireless sensor network; Vital signs; Positioning system; Context awareness; Nursing care; Computer science; Simulation; Bluetooth; Real-time computing,,"Automation/instrumentation; Efficiency, Organizational; Humans; Japan; Monitoring, Physiologic/instrumentation; Nursing Staff, Hospital; Point-of-Care Systems; Vital Signs; Wireless Technology",,,http://www.thieme-connect.de/DOI/DOI?10.3414/ME12-01-0096 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23591822 http://ci.nii.ac.jp/naid/120005477215 https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/pdf/10.3414/ME12-01-0096.pdf http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/189859/1/ME12-01-0096.pdf https://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/handle/2433/189859 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23591822 https://www.thieme-connect.com/products/ejournals/abstract/10.3414/ME12-01-0096 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39314561.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3414/me12-01-0096,23591822,10.3414/me12-01-0096,1661588915,,0,004-774-480-663-545; 006-330-962-678-286; 010-533-602-736-408; 010-991-853-279-510; 014-344-842-620-765; 014-373-513-256-723; 020-456-571-561-671; 020-595-656-415-737; 022-675-338-039-61X; 026-051-520-730-87X; 027-653-962-720-323; 028-347-973-571-23X; 028-848-657-978-930; 033-871-091-417-670; 035-425-069-901-231; 044-779-897-229-182; 046-827-946-359-298; 048-929-612-030-775; 054-111-796-698-185; 058-164-183-569-545; 059-428-557-033-968; 062-805-543-471-018; 063-200-348-257-985; 067-408-399-083-725; 075-520-582-980-993; 080-279-645-436-323; 082-470-678-297-903; 085-183-637-234-25X; 087-461-693-537-423; 087-719-502-382-322; 093-011-280-078-07X; 100-283-012-193-021; 104-421-312-543-706; 117-797-680-918-097; 119-926-010-652-673; 125-288-271-223-969; 133-953-261-212-18X; 142-518-590-650-906; 164-602-897-089-842; 164-616-488-345-777; 168-036-345-097-619; 183-072-639-458-434; 183-921-178-227-660; 187-362-786-592-140,15

B. Skelly,"In previous investigations we have shown that judgements of duration are dependent on the corresponding distances with which the intervals of time are associated. This interdependence occurs in visual, auditory and tactile situations, and also when passengers in a vehicle on the road estimate the duration, distance and speed of their journey. The present experiments were designed to determine whether there is a similar interdependence in the estimates made by drivers themselves. Expert drivers drove an experimental vehicle on a motorway. During the journey a signal was given at a predetermined point in time or distance. The subjects estimated, at the end of each journey, the pre- and post-signal durations, distances and speeds. The results suggest that comparative judgements of the duration of a journey are clearly influenced by distance and speed. The results are also consistent with the converse effect of duration and speed on apparent distance, but inconclusive for the effect of duration and distance on subjective speed. Of the three variables studied speed seems to be judged most accurately. Duration seems to be over-stated by comparison with joint estimates of distance and speed, while the latter appear to be understated by comparison with the two corresponding pairs of estimates.",17,3,279,289,Statistics; Angular distance; Accident prevention; Poison control; Injury control; Simulation,,,,,https://www.jstor.org/stable/3006559 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1057/jors.1966.55.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1057%2Fjors.1966.55,http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/jors.1966.55,,10.1057/jors.1966.55,1963735027,,0,015-528-838-672-215; 018-239-818-720-257; 037-303-728-421-379; 038-038-250-398-529; 044-451-087-503-048; 081-101-321-346-661; 087-480-331-914-192; 118-352-949-446-489,1

Components of the gains known to the agents and acted on by them may not be known by the observing economist. Such models are called correlated random coefficient models. Sorting on unobserved components of gains complicates the interpretation of what IV estimates. This paper examines testable implications of the hypothesis that agents do not sort into treatment based on gains. In it, we develop new tests to gauge the empirical relevance of the correlated random coefficient model to examine whether the additional complications associated with it are required. We examine the power of the proposed tests. We derive a new representation of the variance of the instrumental variable estimator for the correlated random coefficient model. We apply the methods in this paper to the prototypical empirical problem of estimating the return to schooling and find evidence of sorting into schooling based on unobserved components of games",,,,,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39383759.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1920/wp.cem.2010.1010,,10.1920/wp.cem.2010.1010,,,0,,0

F. Casparie; Christiaan J. Lako,"qn this study, we have looked for differences between medical specialists and patients with chronic diseases (COPD, rheumatoid arthritis and diabetes mellitus) in preferences of aspects of care in relation to the quality of care, Firstly, to enumerate relevant aspects for chronic diseases, open interviews and a concept mapping were conducted among patients with a chronic disease, and medical specialists treating them. Here. the respondents have been asked to evaluate statements in relation to the quality of care. Secondly, a final questionnaire, including statements on nine relevant aspects of care, was presented to patients and medical specialists. The response rate among patients was 96% (N = 260) and among medical specialists 67'% (N = 340). Both study populations ranked 'effectiveness of care' the highest. However, the difference m opinion between the two populations was significant, mainly due to the patient's giving a higher ranking to 'continuity of care' and a lower ranking to 'efficiency'. Significant differences were also found between the three patient groups on the aspects 'knowledge' and ""waiting time for treatment'. Patients with rheumatoid arthritis ranked ""knowledge' higher and 'waiting time for treatment"" lower than did the other two patient groups. A lower level of education, having state-regulated health insurance and being older were associated with a higher preference for 'continuity'. Between the three groups of the medical specialists, no significant differences were found regarding to the profession, age and sex. In conclusion: the patients and medical specialists researched did not show wide differences of opinion on preferences of care in relation to quality. The only exception to this concerned 'continuity of care' which was ranked higher by paticms.",42,5,643,649,Public health; Nursing; Ranking; Specialty; Response rate (survey); Disease; Continuity of care; Quality of care; Age and sex; Family medicine; Medicine,,"Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Arthritis, Rheumatoid/psychology; Attitude of Health Personnel; Chronic Disease/psychology; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2/psychology; Female; Humans; Lung Diseases, Obstructive/psychology; Male; Medicine; Middle Aged; Patient Education as Topic; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Health Care; Sick Role; Specialization; Treatment Outcome",,,https://repub.eur.nl/pub/64621 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/186241 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8685732 http://bdsp-ehesp.inist.fr/vibad/index.php?action=getRecordDetail&idt=118035 https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai:repub.eur.nl:64621 https://repub.eur.nl/pub/64621/1-s2.0-0277953695002006-main.pdf https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/socmed/v42y1996i5p643-649.html https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0277953695002006 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0277953695002006 https://core.ac.uk/display/43315821 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/43315821.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0277-9536(95)00200-6,8685732,10.1016/0277-9536(95)00200-6,2066128149,,0,004-328-886-546-891; 017-379-108-658-848; 025-804-872-727-188; 026-363-879-651-740; 045-627-738-023-711; 066-727-097-941-992; 070-724-659-564-81X; 072-247-559-430-092; 075-013-242-658-58X; 088-527-987-817-311; 115-282-279-745-93X; 140-725-847-725-141; 198-754-631-432-902,51

Reid; Paul Anthony Scuffham,"Background ; Beyond examining their overall cost-effectiveness and mechanisms of effect, it is important to understand patient preferences for the delivery of different modes of chronic heart failure management programs (CHF-MPs). We elicited patient preferences around the characteristics and willingness-to-pay (WTP) for a clinic or home-based CHF-MP.; ; ; Methodology/Principal Findings ; A Discrete Choice Experiment was completed by a sub-set of patients (n = 91) enrolled in the WHICH? trial comparing home versus clinic-based CHF-MP. Participants provided 5 choices between hypothetical clinic and home-based programs varying by frequency of nurse consultations, nurse continuity, patient costs, and availability of telephone or education support. Participants (aged 71±13 yrs, 72.5% male, 25.3% NYHA class III/IV) displayed two distinct preference classes. A latent class model of the choice data indicated 56% of participants preferred clinic delivery, access to group CHF education classes, and lower cost programs (p<0.05). The remainder preferred home-based CHF-MPs, monthly rather than weekly visits, and access to a phone advice service (p<0.05). Continuity of nurse contact was consistently important. No significant association was observed between program preference and participant allocation in the parent trial. WTP was estimated from the model and a dichotomous bidding technique. For those preferring clinic, estimated WTP was ≈AU$9-20 per visit; however for those preferring home-based programs, WTP varied widely (AU$15-105).; ; ; Conclusions/Significance ; Patient preferences for CHF-MPs were dichotomised between a home-based model which is more likely to suit older patients, those who live alone, and those with a lower household income; and a clinic-based model which is more likely to suit those who are more socially active and wealthier. To optimise the delivery of CHF-MPs, health care services should consider their patients’ preferences when designing CHF-MPs.",8,3,1,8,Cost–benefit analysis; Health care; Alternative medicine; Willingness to pay; Health services research; Household income; Family medicine; Health economics; Latent class model; Medicine; Gerontology,,"Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choice Behavior; Chronic Disease; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Disease Management; Female; Heart Failure/psychology; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Preference; Socioeconomic Factors",,,https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0058347 https://minerva-access.unimelb.edu.au/handle/11343/261577 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/19895 http://ecite.utas.edu.au/85502/1/85502%20Journal%20Article.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3591337 https://researchbank.acu.edu.au/fhs_pub/1755/ http://ecite.utas.edu.au/85502 https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:325320 https://paperity.org/p/61030420/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-based-program-of-chronic https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/2440/79532/2/hdl_79532.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/16518950 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013PLoSO...858347W/abstract https://digital.library.adelaide.edu.au/dspace/handle/2440/79532 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3591337/ http://eprints.victorchang.edu.au/146/ https://opus.lib.uts.edu.au/handle/10453/30631 https://jhu.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b-3 https://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058347 http://www98.griffith.edu.au/dspace/bitstream/handle/10072/54736/86577_1.pdf;sequence=1 https://research.torrens.edu.au/en/publications/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-b https://acuresearchbank.acu.edu.au/item/89531/patient-preferences-and-willingness-to-pay-for-a-home-or-clinic-based-program-of-chronic-heart-failure-management-findings-from-the-which-trial https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/54736 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58428/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/16518950.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0058347,23505491,10.1371/journal.pone.0058347,1996218086,PMC3591337,0,004-645-624-737-312; 004-903-227-535-281; 007-848-404-294-790; 007-918-607-348-614; 010-195-457-296-442; 013-813-279-154-883; 016-082-810-469-277; 019-733-899-604-476; 024-188-264-101-592; 026-146-102-140-668; 030-843-431-654-094; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-860-260-967-736; 041-672-649-119-516; 047-772-517-797-741; 052-097-839-766-248; 056-105-887-550-815; 056-874-654-501-138; 063-966-043-082-538; 065-011-766-727-839; 071-674-642-056-169; 093-149-980-450-604; 093-472-739-539-696; 095-720-759-868-465; 116-411-055-251-767; 131-098-763-329-081; 139-433-096-843-007; 142-102-784-505-222; 158-469-764-622-896; 160-441-821-953-411,55

Here, two theories of these errors are considered. For the wave theory of discrimination, constant errors directly originate from discrimination operations. For the inferential theory, the same errors are due to probabilistic inferences drawn after discrimination. Previous studies suggest that the second of two successively compared stimuli has more influence on the comparative response. The results of the present experiment, in which successive lines as comparison stimuli were used, confirm this suggestion. The wave theory does not explain these results, while the inferential theory explains them in terms of probabilistic inferences. Analysis of response frequencies and response times indicates that there was a response bias in favour of the “longer” response. Interfering lines appearing before the first comparison line significantly affected response frequency, response time, and discriminability, whereas interpolated lines significantly affected only response frequency and response time. The inferential theory does not explain these effects on response time, while the wave theory explains them as due to modifications of response bias. These results suggest the possibility that the two theories describe independent sources of constant errors.",58,1,10,18,Stimulus (physiology); Response bias; Interference (wave propagation); Cognitive psychology; Response time; Judgement; Response Frequency; Mathematics; Probabilistic logic; Social psychology,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00447085,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00447085,,,101238075,,0,005-759-420-394-604; 012-617-146-419-177; 015-850-737-875-422; 024-088-126-816-356; 033-642-786-691-538; 034-641-945-645-064; 045-887-070-367-776; 052-702-144-002-922; 056-128-533-365-606; 056-619-448-208-67X; 058-465-268-253-776; 062-825-383-480-975; 063-238-127-718-374; 063-626-432-670-404; 064-326-295-715-03X; 083-411-762-122-782; 084-545-573-771-708; 085-942-243-360-610; 107-117-083-026-31X; 111-860-109-740-18X; 121-057-693-330-891; 126-813-289-086-121; 127-930-296-287-932; 135-162-029-487-041; 141-116-690-555-609; 160-780-928-376-198; 178-535-113-631-236,5

However, there are difficulties in the valid and reliable assessment of features of quality within designerly outputs. In light of recent educational reforms in Ireland, which see the introduction of classroom based assessments centring on design in the technology subjects, it is paramount that the implementation of design assessment is critically considered. An exploratory study was conducted with a 1st year cohort of initial technology teacher education students (N = 126) which involved them completing a design assignment and subsequent assessment process through the use of adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ). In considering the use of ACJ as a potential tool for design assessment at post-primary level, data analysis focused on criteria used for assessment. Results indicate that quantitative variables, i.e., the amount of work done, can significantly predict performance (R2 = .333, p &amp;lt;.001), however qualitative findings suggest that quantity may simply align with quality. Further results illustrate a significant yet practically meaningless bias may exist in the judgement of work through ACJ (φ = .082, p &amp;lt;.01) and that there was need to use varying criteria in the assessment of design outputs.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/ys9eg,,10.31235/osf.io/ys9eg,,,0,,0

Vaak worden de taken van studenten een per een van feedback voorzien middels opmerkingen in de tekst (= klassieke feedback). Recentelijk is echter een alternatieve methode van beoordelen geintroduceerd: paarsgewijze vergelijking (Comparative Judgement, CJ). In CJ wordt aan meerdere beoordelaars gevraagd het werk van studenten per twee te vergelijken en aan te geven welke het beste is (Pollitt, 2012). Op basis van deze vergelijkingen kan een ranking worden opgesteld van goede naar minder goede schrijftaak. Het principe dat beoordelaars makkelijker kwaliteit kunnen duiden in een vergelijking ligt ten grondslag aan deze methode (Thurstone (1927). Huidig onderzoek laat de summatieve voordelen van CJ inzake betrouwbaarheid en validiteit zien (Pollitt, 2012). Dit onderzoek exploreert de formatieve mogelijkheden van CJ door het met de klassieke methode te vergelijken.; ; Feedback kan getypeerd worden op twee dimensies (Walker, 2009). De eerste dimensie onderscheidt de motiverende feedback van de feedback die aangeeft wat beter kan. De tweede dimensie onderscheidt productgericht (aangeven wat goed/niet goed is) van leergerichte feedback (uitleg waarom iets goed/niet goed is). Daarnaast kan feedback geanalyseerd worden naar de inhoudelijke elementen waar het betrekking op heeft. Hyland (2001) geeft aan dat in haar onderzoek opmerkingen over de structuur en organisatie van de essays door studenten als meest bruikbaar benoemd worden. Zij vonden feedback op spelling en interpunctie minder nuttig. Zowel Hyland (2001) als Walker (2009) richtten zich op de klassieke methode.; ; Tot nu hebben enkel [Auteurs (2015)] onderzoek gedaan naar CJ-gebaseerde feedback. Hieruit blijkt dat studenten deze eerlijk, relevant en betrouwbaar vinden. Er is echter geen zicht op of CJ formatieve voordelen biedt voor de beoordelaars en of de inhoud van de feedback verschilt van de klassieke methode.; ; Om inzicht te krijgen in de formatieve mogelijkheden van CJ worden de volgende vragen gesteld:; 1. Welke methode leent zich volgens beoordelaars beter tot het geven van feedback: CJ of de klassieke methode? 2.

014-011-752-837-973,How in-store educational and entertaining events influence shopper satisfaction,,2015,journal article,Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services,09696989,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Sean Sands; Harmen Oppewal; Michael B. Beverland,"While recent years have seen an increased use of educational and entertaining events within the store environment, little seems known about how consumers value such events. This study investigates how the staging of education and entertainment-focused in-store events impacts on consumers’ value perceptions, arousal levels and store satisfaction. It is hypothesized that such events have a positive effect on store satisfaction but that their effects are moderated by a shopper’s motivational orientation. Findings from a scenario-based experiment among 786 shoppers from two retail categories (hardware and computer stores) provide support for this. The findings show that task-oriented consumers derive more value and satisfaction from an education-focused event than from an entertainment-focused event, while recreation-oriented consumers appreciate either type of event. The study findings imply that providing education themed events is a safer option for retailers than providing entertainment-focused events because education satisfies a wider range of shopper needs. Shoppers overall derive pleasure from entertainment but task-oriented shoppers tend to also see it as a hindrance to the convenience of shopping, with the result that for these shoppers the hosting of entertainment-focused events may result in reduced store satisfaction levels.",23,,9,20,Advertising; Business; Marketing; Perception; SAFER; Pleasure; Entertainment,,,,Australian Research Council,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0969698914001647 https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/how-in-store-educational-and-entertaining-events-influence-shoppe http://opus.bath.ac.uk/43322/ https://research.monash.edu/en/publications/how-in-store-educational-and-entertaining-events-influence-shoppe https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/joreco/v23y2015icp9-20.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/38145638.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jretconser.2014.11.004,,10.1016/j.jretconser.2014.11.004,2018695380,,0,000-201-137-552-369; 003-140-732-125-401; 005-805-453-463-041; 007-854-482-510-648; 007-964-360-049-977; 008-745-725-231-357; 008-781-154-400-468; 009-654-701-895-098; 009-660-310-368-080; 015-352-058-145-645; 021-291-831-006-396; 021-509-034-781-225; 022-014-783-792-118; 022-550-699-411-326; 022-738-560-755-25X; 024-590-112-768-385; 024-987-970-387-779; 025-724-556-647-792; 031-435-333-872-040; 032-836-393-727-80X; 037-182-375-780-06X; 037-961-038-553-803; 039-509-402-080-005; 040-105-697-406-299; 043-605-963-780-196; 044-871-194-437-438; 047-344-438-668-289; 049-660-750-407-427; 050-990-830-807-807; 052-870-760-945-978; 054-396-638-063-063; 055-690-424-934-672; 057-291-391-588-041; 064-682-467-305-522; 070-371-526-233-178; 071-108-508-815-500; 074-183-102-061-103; 074-302-411-610-574; 075-018-831-496-091; 076-108-758-116-907; 080-704-095-964-360; 084-128-479-124-398; 085-065-381-644-265; 088-297-250-020-315; 090-937-029-701-095; 091-967-938-887-169; 093-068-966-014-086; 093-776-900-484-728; 095-025-581-845-420; 098-745-061-538-27X; 104-921-910-226-066; 105-693-812-746-257; 112-669-526-477-352; 113-565-849-458-391; 120-620-795-116-97X; 122-046-490-794-277; 124-078-512-127-213; 124-997-949-036-098; 125-142-571-566-486; 131-651-986-799-153; 132-036-228-529-148; 134-530-538-554-839; 143-900-293-611-306; 146-429-317-292-299; 147-012-047-702-018; 148-760-101-987-81X; 151-581-866-638-448; 151-724-363-481-667; 154-445-350-994-401; 154-864-825-745-633; 156-797-365-377-416; 166-041-022-341-019; 169-794-449-204-481; 171-452-483-413-801; 173-048-998-587-905; 173-316-897-160-45X; 190-434-311-500-968; 192-196-957-352-548,17

Doward; Diane Whalley; Stephen P. McKenna; David Meads; Sharon A. Cook; PC Langley,"OBJECTIVE: The Recurrent Genital Herpes Quality of Life questionnaire (RGHQoL) is a needs-based quality of life (QoL) instrument specifically for use with recurrent genital herpes (RGH). It has been shown to have excellent psychometric properties. However, it cannot currently be used in the calculation of utility for economic analyses. Existing utility instruments cover symptoms and functioning, rather than QoL. Concern has been expressed over their relevance for RGH and, consequently, their ability to show differences between interventions. The aim of this project is to explore the potential for using the RGHQoL to produce meaningful utility scores. The first stage was to investigate whether a preference elicitation exercise was required or whether RGHQoL responses could be incorporated directly into utility analyses. This paper presents findings from the first stage.; ; METHODS: Structured interviews were conducted with 100 RGH patients. Patients undertook preference exercises (paired comparison and ranking) with six RGHQoL items and completed the RGHQoL. Thurstone’s law of comparative judgement was used to calculate item preference weights. These were compared with item severity weights derived via application of the Rasch model to RGHQoL responses.; ; RESULTS: Item ordering of severity was: B-E-D-C-A-F (paired comparisons), B-C-D-E-A-F (ranking) and F-A-DC-E-B (Rasch severity). The paired comparisons and ranking exercises resulted in different ordering of some items, even though the methods are considered direct alternatives for eliciting preference information. The Rasch severity and preference weights provided very different orderings. For example, the most severe item according to patients’ responses to the RGHQoL was judged the least severe in the paired comparison and ranking situations.; ; CONCLUSIONS: The results suggest that individuals’ ratings of what would have the most impact on them are very different from what actually has an impact. RGHQoL responses cannot be used directly in place of preference elicitation.",4,6,447,,Rasch model; Quality of life; Structured interview; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Ranking; Operations management; Psychological intervention; Judgement; Preference elicitation; Clinical psychology,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1098301511716023 http://clok.uclan.ac.uk/12203/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82017002.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1098-3015(11)71602-3,,10.1016/s1098-3015(11)71602-3,2087037206,,0,,0

One of the critical steps in this endeavour is the selection of an offshore supplier among many potential alternatives. Therefore, the offshore supplier selection decision has emerged as an important aspect of strategic alliance formation. Given the multi-criteria nature of the offshore supplier selection decision, this article proposed a comprehensive problem definition hierarchy highlighting the key elements criteria at its various levels based on a thorough study and analysis of the existing literature on IT outsourcing ITO industry. A data collection instrument is designed to capture comparative judgements from Indian practitioners on relative importance of each element in the hierarchy. Analytic hierarchy process AHP is applied to synthesise the captured data to get the normalised weights of these criteria. Lowest level criteria are eventually used to rank three suppliers to test the veracity of the proposed hierarchy. At the end a sensitivity analysis is conducted to verify the stability of the outcome.",20,2,238,269,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Service provider; Business requirements; Marketing; Process management; Strategic alliance; Hierarchy; Computer science; Business model; Outsourcing; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1504/IJBIS.2015.071541 https://ideas.repec.org/a/ids/ijbisy/v20y2015i2p238-269.html https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ijbis/ijbis20.html#MukherjeeM15 https://www.inderscienceonline.com/doi/abs/10.1504/IJBIS.2015.071541,http://dx.doi.org/10.1504/ijbis.2015.071541,,10.1504/ijbis.2015.071541,2191643445,,0,000-454-989-315-705; 002-360-860-581-952; 002-940-083-775-146; 004-514-149-115-089; 005-198-603-690-820; 006-157-055-509-458; 006-438-093-717-689; 007-254-359-760-909; 010-974-696-578-335; 013-611-750-839-871; 013-640-734-196-207; 013-939-644-426-511; 015-931-722-282-83X; 018-857-616-088-538; 019-533-953-750-137; 023-456-379-748-152; 032-291-176-872-712; 033-777-414-252-831; 038-767-279-016-176; 039-360-281-212-784; 039-872-566-277-206; 041-569-151-171-75X; 042-252-461-352-098; 043-362-437-537-061; 049-516-261-203-419; 050-050-157-801-041; 070-220-938-767-506; 070-637-343-796-512; 070-935-005-752-82X; 071-723-970-730-94X; 072-978-672-799-552; 073-968-270-182-290; 078-687-097-246-684; 078-736-043-740-538; 083-791-521-464-084; 090-125-136-491-149; 090-781-333-707-477; 106-185-715-526-653; 109-727-266-333-807; 113-992-768-645-036; 128-258-722-708-271; 129-932-503-927-253; 134-503-360-305-806; 139-958-837-881-96X; 140-888-153-100-207; 145-745-479-561-074; 147-029-065-111-001; 147-144-757-282-69X; 163-089-618-870-29X; 163-122-260-668-119; 167-086-299-282-459; 169-614-189-242-690; 180-433-455-974-516; 194-171-525-697-077,2

In each experiment, subjects were to store serial orders of objects on a size dimension. Memory was tested after a brief retention interval by a comparative judgement task, in which subjects were presented with two elements of an order and had to point to the formerly larger one. Regarding the response times, we hypothesized that modality variations affect speed of stimulus identification and code access processes. We further hypothesized that distance variations and end-term variations affect processing components that are independent of the component affected by the modality variation. Finally, we assumed that end-term and distance effects interact in a predictable way, because they mirror competing response selection strategies. The latency data clearly support these hypotheses. As regards the accuracy data, we argued that modality and end-term effects, if they show up within the accuracy data, very likely have a different basis than the effects within the latency data. Again, the data support this assumption showing clear dissociations of accuracy and latency data. With respect to the stimulus modality variation, the whole data pattern shows that explanations which rely on modality-specific codings are not justifiable.

Or more effective? Or just better? And if many judges agree that the same one is better, isn’t that the best evidence for validity we could ask for? This paper describes progress in applying comparative judgement (first reported to IAEA in 2004) to the assessment of holistic traits like overall achievement, including effectivenes, quality and creativity. Marking was invented (in Cambridge) during the 18th century enlightment, not in pursuit of validity or even reliability but to overcome serious problems of bias and prejudice in the examinations of the day. Its unintended consequence has been a most serious loss of validity in most of our formal assessments. Some progress has been made in abolishing marksism in UK assessment. A web-based system has been developed for presenting pairs of ‘scripts’ and collecting judgements, and the estimation procedure has been shown to be remarkably robust with the extremely sparse data ‘matrices’ that result. A simple initiation algorithm has been used developed. Some technical aspects of the procedure are described, and a procedure for qualitative description of the scalel for public use id described.",,,,,Prejudice (legal term); Creativity; Cognitive psychology; Public use; Judgement; Best evidence; Computer science; Scripting language; Ask price,,,,,http://www.iaea.info/documents/paper_4d527d4e.pdf,http://www.iaea.info/documents/paper_4d527d4e.pdf,,,2183239037,,0,007-329-931-054-508; 029-742-013-802-885; 062-761-581-145-860; 081-706-627-783-516; 091-666-780-893-50X; 132-949-076-350-478; 135-138-028-187-899; 182-352-858-647-024; 196-395-556-771-386,2

A contributory factor to this situation is the need for student work to be marked reliably by a large number of markers of varied experience and competence. We report a study that tested an alternative approach to assessment, called comparative judgement, which may represent a superior method for assessing open-ended questions that encourage a range of unpredictable responses. An innovative problem solving examination paper was specially designed by examiners, evaluated by mathematics teachers, and administered to 750 secondary school students of varied mathematical achievement. The students’ work was then assessed by mathematics education experts using comparative judgement as well as a specially designed, resource-intensive marking procedure. We report two main findings from the research. First, the examination paper writers, when freed from the traditional constraint of producing a mark scheme, designed questions that were less structured and more problem-based than is typical in current school mathematics examination papers. Second, the comparative judgement approach to assessing the student work proved successful by our measures of inter-rater reliability and validity. These findings open new avenues for how school mathematics, and indeed other areas of the curriculum, might be assessed in the future.",89,3,337,355,Competence (human resources); Grading (education); Mathematics education; Psychology; Judgement; Alternative assessment; Mathematical achievement; Contributory factor; Curriculum; Inter-rater reliability,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/The_problem_of_assessing_problem_solving_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9368165 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1063770 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10649-015-9607-1 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1 https://core.ac.uk/display/42481600 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42481600.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1,,10.1007/s10649-015-9607-1,847524857,,0,009-040-865-972-962; 009-486-832-701-513; 011-160-890-327-445; 014-392-940-528-758; 015-610-828-146-943; 017-792-980-099-478; 018-682-624-707-990; 020-705-299-726-856; 026-164-384-416-667; 028-156-191-431-484; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-359-405-244-950; 044-803-196-956-309; 047-593-198-756-593; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 048-799-681-315-43X; 051-333-856-176-237; 051-426-516-197-907; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 070-361-353-936-043; 073-315-773-701-875; 079-541-121-124-826; 082-657-515-340-970; 088-812-912-022-656; 090-072-397-423-703; 099-957-854-253-785; 100-687-607-260-140; 102-955-514-174-383; 103-363-666-097-871; 106-532-502-155-602; 107-790-959-417-375; 121-019-778-501-955; 130-423-056-479-881; 131-849-599-517-076; 142-199-023-707-579; 146-286-866-668-740; 149-611-039-927-337; 154-724-624-625-585; 155-651-604-500-728; 159-833-656-458-528; 164-086-224-126-233; 168-390-137-537-685; 168-704-895-296-891; 172-081-104-965-398; 173-524-720-434-335; 175-755-079-554-999; 176-786-786-040-880; 179-726-268-053-176; 182-789-160-159-32X; 187-070-003-592-896,19

Not only does the difficulty apply to the actual negotiation part, but it also extends to the written assignments that typically accompany a simulation. For one thing, if different raters are involved, it is important to assure that differences in severity do not affect the grades. Recently, comparative judgement (CJ) has been introduced as a method allowing for a team-based grading. This chapter discusses in particular the potential of comparative judgement for assessing briefing papers from 84 students. Four assessors completed 622 comparisons in the Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) tool. Results indicate a reliability level of 0.71 for the final rank order, which had demanded a time investment around 10.5 h from the team of assessors. Next to this, there was no evidence of bias towards the most important roles in the simulation game. The study also details how the obtained rank orders were translated into grades, ranging from 11 to 17 out of 20. These elements showcase CJ’s advantage in reaching adequate reliability levels for briefing papers in an efficient manner.",,,93,108,Competence (human resources); Engineering management; Grading (education); Ranking; Negotiation; Judgement; Computer science,,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:197002,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8,,10.1007/978-3-319-74147-5_8,2789394434,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 043-993-488-611-488; 045-320-167-026-428; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 066-908-670-161-319; 068-124-584-046-362; 074-693-792-478-319; 077-950-549-589-039; 101-970-162-694-164; 107-790-959-417-375; 130-140-615-234-208; 141-811-530-730-484; 145-410-732-577-674; 165-389-321-547-720; 177-072-688-486-223,1

Previous attempts of wide implementation of other theories of imprecise probabilities in reliability analyses have not succeeded. The recent theory of coherent imprecise previsions appeared to be a promising tool for reliability and risk assessments and to be devoid of the drawbacks of its predecessors. This paper describes an approach to how the coherent imprecise reliabilities of series and parallel systems can be calculated. A set of theorems is proven to allow the calculation of the imprecise reliability of a system of an arbitrary structure, in particular with fault trees.

Figures used in Exp. I, Exp. II and Exp. IV are shown in Fig. 2, Fig. 7 and Fig. 10 respectively. The general procedure was the same as Kohler's and Wirt's “Vollreihen Mothode” was used to measure the amount of after-effect. The course of the declination of after-effects. The course of the declination of after-effects was caught every five seconds by subjects' judgement. The length of the inspection period were 1, 5, 15, 30, 60, 120 and 240 sec.The test for the declining process of figural after-effects in Exp. III under the same arrangement of figures as Exp. I was performed by Hammers' second method which eliminated the factor of successive induction. Exp. V was the test-experiment performed under the condition shown in Eig. 13 which was considered to be the test situation of Exp. IV.Results 1) Under the same conditions of experiments, the Kohler-effect and the Gibson-effect were demonstrated to be identical process.2) The amount of after-effects (including Gibson's negativre after-effects) depends upon the size and arrangement of figures. If the size and arrangement of figures are kept constant, the amount of after-effects percieved immediately after the inspection of I. F. remains constant irrespective of the length of the inspection period.On the contrary as regards colour-effects, the longer the inspection time is, the more conspicuous are the effects.3) The amount of after-effects is maximum immediately after inspection, at first it diminishes quickly, then later gradually. When the inspection time is shorter, the gradient of the decay-curve is sharper. The decay-curves of after-effects strictly agree with Muller's formula.4) The so-called growth-curves of the after-effects that have been determined by Hammer etc. are shown to be nothing more than thecurve of after-effects considered as a function of the inspection time under the condition of several seconds after the inspection of I. F. Therefore, these curves reveal only the limited case of the growing process of after-effects.5) The gradient of the decay-curve of after-effects that in the decay-curve under the condition of the larger I. F. (see Fig. 2) is slower than that of the smaller I. F. (see Fig. 7). The longer the inspection time is, the more prominent is the defference of the gradient in decay-curves.6) Although in determining the decay-process of after-effects the method of successive judgement is a very convenient procedure as Hammer has pointed out, there is a significant difference between the results by the method of successive judgement (Hammer's first method) and those by the method of white-paper-insertion (Hammer's second method) in our experiments. In order to get the correct data, it is neccessry to modify the data obtained by the method of successive judgement.7) Gibson-effects are influensed more or less by the direction of the curved-line. This fact may be explained by the factor of “Zentrishe Schrumpfung des Sehraumes” (Obonai's theory) and by the factor of the potential-illusion in comparative judgement of parallel curved-line (V. F. and T. F.)8) In experiment on figural after-effects, especially in studying temporal factors, we must take into consideration the judgement mechanism of the subjects.",24,1,59,66,Statistics; Declination; Hammer; Psychology; Judgement; Inspection time; Significant difference; Qualitative analysis,,,,,https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/jjpsy1926/24/1/24_1_59/_pdf http://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/jjpsy1926/24.59?from=CrossRef,http://dx.doi.org/10.4992/jjpsy.24.59,,10.4992/jjpsy.24.59,2335140965,,0,,10

By far most of the study has been based on a single view. Selecting Confucius Temple-Qinhuai River Scenic Area in Nanjing as the typical case of urban traditional and cultural tourism destination, this paper made an empirical analysis of the characteristics and law of the coupling between the landscape pattern and landscape aesthetic by using the landscape pattern index as the criterion of ecological beauty as well as the Balanced Incomplete Block-Law of Comparative Judgement as the criterion of landscape beauty. The results displayed: 1) The overall landscape fragmentation of the studied area was rather high, but different parts of landscape were influenced differently by artificial factors. The diversity and heterogeneity of landscape patches were moderate, but there were structural differences of the area of patch, spatial distribution and spatial agglomeration degree. 2) The tourists and local residents had good perception of landscape aesthetic of the scenic area, however, they had preference forthe historical architecture and cultural landscape with abundant elements of city memory. 3) As a whole, the relationship between the landscape pattern and landscape aesthetic was coupled and complementary. Confucius Temple-Qinhuai River Scenic Area had profound history and culture, however, under the background of the rapid development of urbanization, cultural characteristics were missing constantly and the process of delocalization was speeded up. Hence, it would be a long way to go to protect city memory and inherit local culture for the scenic area, which is an important traditional and cultural tourism destination of the city.",,,,,Environmental resource management; Landscape design; Architecture; Cultural landscape; Landscape archaeology; Geography; Judgement; Cultural tourism; Beauty; Urbanization; Cartography,,,,,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-RDDD201506018.htm,https://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTotal-RDDD201506018.htm,,,2361661726,,0,,0

Since the Dutch DCE was carried out right after the 2006 health reform, which made citizens explicitly choose a health insurance contract, two research questions naturally arise. First, are the preferences with regard to contract attributes (such as Managed Care-type restrictions of physician choice), incentives (such as bonus options for no claims, deductibles, and a bonus for preventive behavior), and extra services provided by the health insurer (such as patient counseling) similar between the two countries? Second, was the requirement to explicitly choose imposed by the Dutch government in the context of the reform effective in reducing status quo bias with respect to future reforms?",4,1,22,22,Public economics; Status quo bias; Public health; Government; Actuarial science; Economics; Public finance; Willingness to pay; Health services research; Incentive; Health economics,Discrete choice experiments; Germany; Health insurance; Health reform; Netherlands; Preference measurement,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6 https://paperity.org/p/49481156/preferences-for-health-insurance-in-germany-and-the-netherlands-a-tale-of-two-countries https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51786/ https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/76181 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4209455/ http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4209455 https://healtheconomicsreview.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6 https://www.zora.uzh.ch/id/eprint/51786/1/wp1002.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6/fulltext.html https://core.ac.uk/display/81285811 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80046872.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6,25386387,10.1186/s13561-014-0022-6,2151348462,PMC4209455,0,002-043-987-338-109; 004-895-319-909-247; 005-290-905-754-326; 005-329-717-933-787; 005-773-562-974-074; 007-484-909-003-94X; 010-195-457-296-442; 012-277-806-980-851; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-141-612-502-359; 044-511-676-188-586; 048-851-838-521-65X; 057-657-809-679-383; 062-783-280-287-096; 071-235-999-619-556; 089-468-883-189-639; 098-376-587-660-420; 102-325-899-749-961; 114-258-605-734-050; 123-840-986-289-076; 143-009-584-641-131; 160-441-821-953-411; 179-729-699-068-218; 186-963-949-309-408,16

(2) The assumption that sentence meanings are basically carried by nouns produces anomalies in the comparative judgement of passages with large amounts of noun repetition and minimal verb repetition and passages with large amounts of verb repetition and minimal noun repetition. It is suggested that for much moderately redundant English the index seems to work because it co-varies with other aspects of sentence complexity.

Results from a discrete choice experiment in screening for colorectal cancer.,2008-07-24,2008,journal article,Value in health : the journal of the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research,15244733; 10983015,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Kirsten Howard; Glenn Salkeld,"Abstract Objective Recent reviews of discrete choice methodology identified methodological issues warranting further exploration, including the issue of ""framing."" The objective of this study was to conduct a methodological exploration of the effect of attribute framing on marginal rates of substitution (MRS), including willingness to pay (WTP) from a discrete choice experiment (DCE), within the context of colorectal cancer screening preferences. Methods The survey, a fractional factorial design of a two-alternative, unlabeled experiment, was mailed to a sample of 1920 subjects in NSW, Australia. Participants were randomized to one of four alternative ""frames"" of information. Attributes included: accuracy of the test for finding cancers, accuracy of the test for finding large polyps, how good the test is at saying you don't have cancer, cost, dietary and medication restrictions and sample collection. A mixed logit model was used to estimate preferences; MRS between attributes, including WTP, was calculated. Results A total of 1157 surveys from 1920 (60.2%) were returned. Accuracy of the test for finding cancer was most likely to influence choice of test, followed by accuracy of the test for finding large polyps. Under some circumstances, framing of the attributes (e.g., cancers found vs. cancers missed) influenced the relative importance of attributes.

We investigated the personal understanding of ‘Sustainable Development’ of scholars involved in teacher training programs and in the academic field of Education for Sustainable Development. To this purpose, an on-line survey was conducted based on the principle of comparative judgement. After careful selection, 249 academics were found to fit the specific profile for inclusion into the study. All of them were invited and56 of them participated. The instrument consisted of 16 statements built specifically to reflect different interpretations of sustainable development: fragmented, separated, holistic and integrated perspectives. Each participant compared 12 pairs of statements and were asked to decide which one better represented their interpretation of the concept of Sustainable Development in the context of Education for Sustainable Development. Using the D-PAC methodology for comparative judgement, our results show that the statements that were most often chosen prioritized an understanding of Sustainable Development according to which two or three of the dimensions of the concept (environment, society, economy) are seen as separated to each other and less often in an integrated way. The scale reliability was equal to 0.79, indicating good quality of the measurement. The results show that academics in the field of Education for Sustainable Development do not conceive of the concept of Sustainable Development holistically. There is also a tendency towards social and economic aspects of Sustainable Development.

In Experiment 1 we used 1/f filtered grayscale images as well as their thresholded (black and white) and edges only counterparts. Separate groups of observers viewed different types of images varying in slope of their amplitude spectra. Although with each image type, the groups exhibited the “universal” pattern of preference for intermediate amplitude spectrum slopes, we identified 4 distinct sub-groups in each case. Sub-group 1 exhibited a typical peak preference for intermediate amplitude spectrum slopes (‘intermediate’; approx. 50%); sub-group 2 exhibited a linear increase in preference with increasing amplitude spectrum slope (“smooth”; approx. 20%), while sub-group 3 exhibited a linear decrease in preference as a function of the amplitude spectrum slope (“sharp”; approx. 20%). Sub-group 4 revealed no significant preference (“other”; approx. 10%). In Experiment 2, we extended the range of different image types and investigated preferences within the same observers. We replicate the results of our first experiment and show that individual participants exhibit stable patterns of preference across a wide range of image types. In both experiments, Q-mode factor analysis identified two principal factors that were able to explain more than 80% of inter individual variations in preference across all types of images, suggesting a highly similar dimensional structure of inter individual variations in preference for fractal-like scaling characteristics.",10,,350,350,Statistics; Frequency spectrum; Amplitude; Approx; Replicate; Fractal pattern; Mathematics; Fractal; Social psychology; Grayscale; Scaling,aesthetics; fractals; individual differences; individual variability; visual preference,,,Australian Research Council,http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27458365 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4937063 https://core.ac.uk/display/82854035 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82854035.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350,27458365,10.3389/fnhum.2016.00350,2469402787,PMC4937063,0,000-128-261-521-190; 001-211-147-613-925; 002-661-886-502-828; 003-824-045-896-463; 003-959-456-375-10X; 005-077-663-744-498; 007-680-062-502-548; 010-034-760-108-136; 011-215-627-956-928; 013-901-094-038-405; 016-807-326-825-159; 021-833-060-736-756; 024-487-050-604-231; 026-522-767-947-577; 026-697-184-672-246; 028-909-435-621-641; 029-291-085-676-195; 030-106-413-511-735; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-749-371-633-87X; 038-806-201-427-687; 042-329-006-864-369; 043-311-834-368-521; 043-968-325-175-314; 044-398-804-481-25X; 045-877-232-534-487; 046-893-819-712-314; 059-859-454-431-546; 063-259-257-507-199; 065-239-547-848-682; 070-288-762-588-459; 071-894-179-083-409; 072-603-939-753-887; 078-003-375-336-760; 083-056-154-487-047; 089-270-300-626-793; 094-159-592-916-885; 095-881-581-669-414; 097-582-727-442-590; 110-969-517-377-159; 123-113-541-328-801; 134-805-430-204-693; 141-816-682-274-53X; 145-132-276-594-878,35

Yet despite its prominence, little so far is known about its impact on those centrally involved in its implementations: senior management. This paper will investigate the ways in which senior management within one of the major privatised industries, the Water Industry, have sought to give effect to the strategic change involved in the transformation of a public sector Water Authority into a private sector Water plc. Although the monopoly character of the supply of Water services has remained intact, managers in the new Water plcs have had to respond to new expectations and assessments of corporate performance from shareholders, investors and financial analysts; from customers; and from a new economic regulatory regime operated by the Director General of the Office of Water Services. The Director General, in addition to operating price controls, is committed to developing lyardstickr competition which will provide the opportunity to make comparative judgements about performance levels achieved by each of the new Water plcs. In pursuit of improvements in efficiency and profitability, senior managers have engineered a variety of restructurings of corporate organisation to give more focus to achieving new business objectives, and to move away from a public sector bureaucratic management style with its traditional tall-pyramid structure to flatter and less hierarchical management structures. Although many of the changes have been justified in terms of empowerment and providing more autonomy for local managers, the paper argues that the experience of change for these managers has largely consisted of being subjected to much greater accountability for their performance through greater emphasis on the achievement of financial targets, more systematic monitoring of performance, the introduction of individual performance appraisal, and performance-related pay. Central to this intensification of the scrutiny of performance have been changes in accounting information systems and how they are used. In examining how these changes have functioned in their organisational context, the paper seeks to contribute to an understanding of the role of accounting in processes of organisational change",10,1,91,124,Private sector; Accounting; Public sector; Economics; Accounting information system; Accountability; Performance appraisal; Senior management; Monopoly; Water industry,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1045235498902003,http://dx.doi.org/10.1006/cpac.1998.0200,,10.1006/cpac.1998.0200,1993040776,,0,,60

This paper applies a novel approach to facilitating novice feedback: making use of students’ inherent ability to compare. The ComPAIR application discussed in this article scaffolds peer feedback through comparisons, asking students to choose the “better” of two answers in a series of pairings offered in an engaging online context. In contrast to other peer-feedback approaches that seek to train novices to be able to provide expert feedback (such as calibrated peer review) or to crowdsource grading, ComPAIR focuses upon the benefits to be gained from the critical process of comparison and ranking. The tool design is based on the longstanding psychological principle of comparative judgement, by which novices who may not yet have the compass to assess others’ work confidently can still rank content as “better” with accuracy. Data from 168 students in pilot studies in English, Physics and Math courses at the University of British Columbia are reviewed. Though the use of ComPAIR required little classroom time, students perceived this approach to increase their facility with course content, their ability assess their own work, and their capacity to provide feedback on the work of others in a collaborative learning environment.",5,2,89,113,Collaborative learning; Grading (education); Mathematics education; Body of knowledge; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Computer science; Peer feedback; Cooperative learning; Knowledge management; Teaching method,,,,,https://jmss.org/index.php/TLI/article/view/57484 https://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1156350.pdf http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ1156350.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/87752274 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1156350 http://tlijournal.com/tli/index.php/TLI/article/view/156,http://dx.doi.org/10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.2.8,,10.20343/teachlearninqu.5.2.8,2756771427,,0,007-480-370-853-992; 007-702-163-095-94X; 019-556-884-590-37X; 042-436-932-221-374; 075-245-815-139-991; 080-170-730-910-326,8

Sanbonmatsu; Sam Vanous; Christine Hook; Steven S. Posavac; Frank R. Kardes,"Judgements of the value or likelihood of a focal object or outcome have been shown to vary dramatically as a function of whether judgement is based on selective or comparative processing. This article explores the question of when selective versus comparative processing is likely, and demonstrates that as motivation and opportunity to process information carefully (operationalised as accountability and time pressure, respectively) decrease, the likelihood of selective processing increases. Moreover, we document how individuals manage to render judgements when in selective processing mode by relying on categorical knowledge.",17,4,367,386,Psychology; Accountability; Judgement; Time pressure; Process information; Categorical variable; Social psychology,,,,,https://philpapers.org/rec/SANWTA https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546783.2011.625659,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13546783.2011.625659,,10.1080/13546783.2011.625659,2117801570,,0,005-485-876-843-169; 011-294-229-633-750; 013-544-463-064-180; 013-745-435-865-213; 013-783-550-643-429; 014-180-901-417-241; 014-308-665-117-027; 016-137-262-831-356; 021-778-775-202-433; 021-952-839-399-302; 022-436-842-602-143; 023-128-881-912-285; 023-163-327-843-255; 027-039-491-355-998; 031-878-002-743-319; 034-211-272-440-012; 041-202-184-970-389; 045-084-339-663-73X; 046-228-912-740-280; 050-397-057-022-908; 052-542-309-265-668; 052-709-433-159-880; 064-800-795-739-535; 065-705-302-068-19X; 073-835-937-651-43X; 075-012-371-852-739; 088-800-594-748-591; 090-023-370-872-145; 091-848-201-207-788; 110-279-588-133-911; 113-030-426-538-874; 116-762-136-028-844; 119-554-004-984-677; 121-833-225-038-653; 124-475-767-674-277; 127-896-895-458-725; 137-593-538-517-285; 140-090-749-158-466; 141-022-843-692-421; 143-015-464-819-987; 148-659-199-067-58X; 168-933-907-555-395; 176-225-682-058-568; 177-531-429-833-147; 188-994-374-837-764; 190-086-181-064-265; 191-389-458-760-496,11

Results from three experiments on complete-facial expressions (happy/angry) and mixed-facial expressions (neutral/happy-or-angry) pairs viewed with (Experiment 1 and 3) or without (Experiment 2) foveation and performed in conditions in which valence was either task relevant (Experiment 1 and 2) or task irrelevant (Experiment 3), show that comparative judgements of emotions are stimulus driven. Judgements' speed increased as the target absolute emotion intensity grew larger together with the average emotion of the pair, irrespective of the compatibility between the valence and the side of motor response: a semantic congruency effect in the domain of emotion. This result undermines previous interpretation of results in the context of comparative judgements based on the lateralization of emotions (e.g., SNARC-like instructional flexibility), and is fully consistent with our formalization of emotional semantic congruency: the direct Speed-Intensity Association model.",190,,20,41,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Facial expression; Everyday life; Association model; Emotion intensity; Expression (mathematics); Lateralization of brain function,Emotion; Facial expressions; SNARC effect; Semantic congruency; Spatial attention; Spatial representation,Adolescent; Adult; Emotions; Facial Expression; Facial Recognition; Female; Humans; Judgment; Male; Reaction Time; Semantics; Young Adult,,Regione Autonoma Friuli Venezia Giulia; Università degli Studi di Trieste,https://arts.units.it/handle/11368/2946481 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/31022649 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0010027719300988 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/17719,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.014,31022649,10.1016/j.cognition.2019.04.014,2938536385,,0,001-180-593-948-224; 001-309-649-467-687; 001-736-503-518-484; 001-995-708-037-242; 002-244-821-401-703; 003-086-472-590-707; 003-683-845-316-328; 004-347-722-689-662; 004-731-567-191-050; 004-986-612-800-738; 005-411-361-675-678; 005-848-485-027-260; 006-335-327-688-066; 006-688-443-167-296; 007-101-878-246-410; 008-323-657-407-735; 009-007-905-689-025; 009-351-777-389-759; 009-638-275-134-279; 009-804-637-120-597; 010-234-048-802-227; 012-765-147-718-763; 013-465-817-942-505; 014-196-575-179-503; 014-347-760-732-628; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-803-870-149-321; 016-000-197-860-064; 016-171-393-111-323; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-286-539-418-329; 016-943-586-292-076; 017-411-204-124-990; 017-709-793-678-757; 017-797-479-052-054; 018-765-388-536-256; 018-781-528-222-92X; 019-905-723-784-862; 022-256-358-084-69X; 025-000-409-955-652; 025-498-067-077-896; 025-703-813-430-701; 025-971-418-331-624; 026-380-955-565-508; 027-012-971-940-520; 028-421-417-276-988; 029-915-293-337-721; 030-687-213-835-004; 032-237-252-273-598; 033-527-001-452-462; 035-211-639-161-455; 035-229-209-474-238; 035-522-074-408-50X; 035-845-186-028-970; 036-459-179-538-121; 036-786-901-847-684; 037-046-955-586-195; 037-954-908-422-335; 038-642-909-156-167; 038-672-801-676-993; 043-603-131-662-278; 043-712-703-777-381; 045-614-713-034-892; 046-522-618-604-832; 046-787-115-596-360; 047-449-480-741-911; 047-791-541-584-58X; 048-889-201-158-674; 048-939-869-477-889; 049-092-751-377-693; 049-863-149-640-914; 051-066-076-538-547; 051-390-659-369-102; 051-466-119-337-423; 051-472-129-782-759; 051-812-097-931-69X; 052-496-408-784-733; 053-972-825-127-532; 054-100-154-295-161; 054-649-302-531-591; 054-722-084-317-703; 057-183-336-446-253; 058-175-340-486-49X; 059-972-740-229-626; 061-215-565-452-575; 063-223-495-189-224; 063-600-110-576-241; 063-605-503-678-532; 064-938-778-968-688; 066-608-905-207-154; 066-877-300-844-287; 067-852-505-761-499; 073-851-694-732-402; 076-581-189-154-711; 076-975-705-961-977; 077-955-155-009-954; 078-649-785-249-179; 079-082-211-428-444; 080-496-777-408-835; 081-260-990-315-81X; 082-479-245-913-353; 082-927-142-328-510; 084-837-414-058-221; 085-756-973-622-409; 086-011-582-380-107; 086-214-041-467-250; 087-173-196-464-44X; 087-300-622-382-439; 088-540-204-090-045; 089-363-620-591-465; 090-473-073-536-194; 096-974-841-889-042; 097-118-699-603-908; 100-207-668-556-96X; 100-668-664-094-130; 101-033-639-064-930; 102-141-448-781-894; 105-173-140-212-64X; 105-942-707-129-817; 106-197-189-659-701; 109-190-390-581-587; 109-226-228-744-589; 112-410-962-878-600; 114-992-167-812-755; 115-169-209-648-291; 115-972-804-337-028; 116-953-283-915-381; 118-581-038-700-756; 120-076-869-929-345; 123-478-664-171-99X; 123-588-598-381-661; 125-126-582-214-822; 128-887-777-838-374; 128-909-793-351-309; 131-863-163-235-044; 141-730-925-182-377; 142-970-748-022-995; 149-229-185-800-505; 168-043-103-603-780; 177-913-457-382-682; 196-022-041-043-935,4

To maximise reliability and validity, the literature recommends adopting various design principles including the use of explicit assessment criteria. Counter to this literature, we report a peer assessment exercise in which criteria were deliberately avoided yet acceptable reliability and validity were achieved. Based on this finding, we make two arguments. First, the comparative judgement approach adopted can be applied successfully in different contexts, including higher education and secondary school. Second, the success was due to this approach; an alternative technique based on absolute judgement yielded poor reliability and validity. We conclude that sound outcomes are achievable without assessment criteria, but success depends on how the peer assessment activity is designed.",47,,93,101,Higher education; Psychology; Judgement; Design elements and principles; Peer assessment; Validity; Applied psychology; Social psychology,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/42483594 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Peer_assessment_using_comparative_and_absolute_judgement/9369011 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/19666/1/SEE2015_pre.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191491X15000620 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42483594.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2015.09.004,,10.1016/j.stueduc.2015.09.004,2179650432,,0,004-289-607-809-929; 005-820-117-517-536; 010-680-422-351-332; 011-652-189-202-784; 017-210-364-775-070; 018-269-445-638-29X; 019-177-767-833-539; 020-492-282-615-504; 021-130-293-777-777; 025-448-910-847-271; 026-140-166-599-34X; 026-491-868-974-081; 030-356-908-454-981; 031-914-885-994-589; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-969-129-433-746; 042-538-077-940-518; 045-227-038-372-344; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 051-426-516-197-907; 062-867-221-522-859; 066-397-748-755-431; 070-759-410-602-681; 081-095-585-695-285; 082-633-701-507-010; 084-828-616-966-733; 085-008-427-439-371; 085-782-124-158-049; 087-098-910-782-246; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-920-267-543-941; 101-256-528-118-682; 105-937-076-512-724; 107-543-694-208-595; 107-745-018-119-285; 113-736-958-212-757; 130-423-056-479-881; 145-591-602-199-471; 168-704-895-296-891; 169-608-253-789-308; 170-391-077-299-959; 177-072-688-486-223,18

Wise,"Abstract Subjects made paired comparison judgements about the relative probabilities of pairs of nine hypothetical probabilities statements. Afterwards, the same subjects made subjective probability estimates for the statements. Then the estimates were used to generate pseudo paired comparison judgements, i.e., what the subjects would have said if their estimated subjective probabilities actually determined their paired comparison judgements. Subjective probability scales were derived from both kinds of data using Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgement. Both derived scales closely corresponded to the estimates and to each other. It was concluded that both the paired comparison judgements and the estimates reflected subjects' underlying subjective probabilities for the statements but that estimates are a more efficient measure than are judgements.",5,1,85,92,Statistics; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Judgement; Paired comparison; Mathematics,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0030507370900061,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0030-5073(70)90006-1,,10.1016/0030-5073(70)90006-1,2012561268,,0,003-103-431-474-664; 006-256-394-981-902; 007-053-596-956-779; 013-177-363-094-428; 035-046-423-499-899; 039-518-992-171-963; 090-156-346-450-822; 136-188-341-950-354,6

While the most widely used method is the eigenvector method, the row geometric mean approach has gained popularity due to its mathematical properties and its ease of implementation. In this paper, we discuss a spanning tree method and prove the mathematical equivalence of its preference vector to that of the row geometric mean approach. This is an important finding due to the fact that it identifies an approach for generating a preference vector which has the mathematical properties of the row geometric mean preference vector, and yet, in its entirety, the spanning tree method has more to offer than the row geometric mean method, in that, it is inherently applicable to incomplete sets of pairwise comparison judgements, and also facilitates the use of statistical and visual techniques to gain insights into inconsistency in the DM’s judgements.",257,1,197,208,Algorithm; Discrete mathematics; Eigenvalues and eigenvectors; Equivalence (measure theory); Pairwise comparison; Decision analysis; Preference analysis; Mathematics; Geometric mean; Spanning tree; Graph theory,,,,,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/ejores/v257y2017i1p197-208.html https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/the-mathematical-equivalence-of-the-spanning-tree-and-row-geometric-mean-preference-vectors-and-its-implications-for-preference-analysis(97b20ba8-d9cc-44f7-8535-310839cf7b3c).html http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/102699/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0377221716305975 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/5001410/GRECO_The_mathematical_equivalence_of_the_spanning_tree_and_row_geometric_mean_preference_vectors_and_its_implications_for_preference_analysis.pdf http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0377221716305975 https://core.ac.uk/display/77049218 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/eor/eor257.html#LundySG17,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042,,10.1016/j.ejor.2016.07.042,2490314309,,0,003-354-918-233-842; 003-895-320-956-909; 006-020-375-701-986; 007-631-450-649-532; 009-881-393-198-900; 011-837-366-431-74X; 015-050-303-686-75X; 020-742-339-077-241; 021-004-860-280-453; 021-444-151-543-58X; 026-358-629-546-378; 027-976-997-688-454; 028-461-975-568-965; 032-988-626-764-349; 034-298-311-251-930; 043-847-158-555-238; 044-016-504-410-808; 047-108-373-485-451; 048-291-955-168-581; 052-115-966-839-821; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-718-392-672-185; 060-974-072-936-96X; 061-703-176-018-76X; 067-143-980-711-210; 067-297-975-089-254; 068-133-038-272-957; 069-378-081-758-372; 071-102-883-546-413; 078-500-602-804-841; 086-993-701-614-697; 091-996-940-963-047; 098-880-905-772-456; 106-967-560-410-264; 116-317-784-317-788; 150-330-303-457-122,27

A study among French traffic regulation offenders,,2014,journal article,Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour,13698478,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Cécile Martha; Patricia Delhomme,"Abstract A few studies have shown that road users can express realistic risk judgements, in the sense that they perceive higher risk when their behavior is in fact riskier. Our aim was to examine whether the realism of absolute and comparative judgements about speeding risks could be found among an at-risk driver population made of 539 French traffic regulation offenders taking a driving licence points recovery course. The results showed that course takers’ absolute judgements regarding speeding-ticket risk were realistic: the more course-takers had the intention to drive fast and reported driving-related sensation-seeking (DRSS), the more they evaluated themselves as being at risk of having a speeding-ticket. The realism was also observed when considering comparative judgements regarding speeding-ticket risk, but only among the more than 25 years old participants. Moreover, the realism was not observed when considering course takers’ absolute and comparative judgements regarding speeding-induced crash risk. Hence, it is important to increase communication about the dangerousness of speeding among specific groups such as traffic regulation offenders, above all among young course takers who reported high speeds and DRSS.",26,,126,137,Engineering; Human factors and ergonomics; Occupational safety and health; Injury prevention; Population; Traffic regulation; Poison control; Suicide prevention; Realism; Social psychology,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847814000874 https://trid.trb.org/view/1325304 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847814000874,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trf.2014.06.013,,10.1016/j.trf.2014.06.013,1973768921,,0,000-401-633-250-390; 000-823-132-288-614; 000-999-951-820-28X; 001-539-529-845-798; 003-498-762-032-886; 004-949-838-366-871; 005-144-613-482-837; 005-877-301-064-706; 007-613-518-980-709; 011-229-516-651-416; 011-381-212-740-627; 011-397-141-989-21X; 013-193-621-934-101; 014-954-259-079-367; 015-230-677-876-783; 017-672-929-943-884; 022-909-146-372-273; 024-838-013-412-523; 028-054-628-087-376; 030-615-666-969-205; 031-996-190-068-361; 032-305-380-733-87X; 032-825-855-562-840; 035-118-730-307-332; 038-840-802-711-607; 040-269-259-341-705; 041-860-680-626-354; 053-631-545-301-764; 054-838-615-271-826; 057-506-397-116-307; 057-761-715-276-049; 058-792-998-449-306; 062-333-668-983-145; 062-616-914-957-859; 064-751-787-047-012; 069-129-502-119-839; 072-627-007-404-35X; 072-850-977-359-272; 074-331-217-488-467; 074-912-140-708-016; 079-096-954-600-943; 079-556-927-686-475; 080-239-236-802-672; 081-831-605-583-508; 087-208-348-924-212; 088-869-229-566-701; 090-506-396-354-334; 090-730-952-095-457; 095-904-683-660-006; 097-247-171-152-329; 107-854-421-865-889; 130-650-268-245-489; 136-212-907-362-920; 137-662-770-635-40X; 142-165-678-190-624; 145-067-363-239-702; 150-007-348-151-864; 152-633-318-433-765; 153-385-948-209-094; 158-444-232-588-710; 161-266-888-079-125; 194-340-079-194-828,4

Elimination of fuel subsidy scheme in Indonesia is a perfect example of such occurrence. The subsidy has been implementing to commodity as opposed to households, thus individuals may not necessarily realized that they have been enjoying the subsidy when they buy fuel. In this case people may feel as if they are endowed by the values from the provision of the policy. The elimination of the subsidy consequently may be perceived as a loss - as opposed to a foregone gain. ; This study aims to obtain the most acceptable exit strategy to eliminate the subsidy from the perspective of households by conducting a laboratory-based survey. The alternative exit strategies include methods of elimination of the subsidy and of reallocation of resources saved from eliminating the subsidy. The policy options have been derived using insight from behavioral economics ranging from endowment effect, status quo bias, to present biasness. ; The survey includes 335 subjects, who come from four different backgrounds: 1) households with no motor vehicle; 2) households with only motorcycle(s); (3) households with one car and; 4) households with one luxurious car or more than one car. Each subject faces 55 paired-wise policy alternatives and the method proposed by Dunn-Rankin (1983) has been used to derive the ordering of preferences.; The result shows that gradual elimination of fuel subsidy and reallocation to earmarked programs were the most acceptable policy elements of the exit strategy. The survey, indirectly, showed that subjects’ valuation of losses is greater for direct elimination strategies than that of the equivalent gradual elimination strategies. The results also show that respondents chose “to pay” later at a smaller amount than “to pay” immediately of the equivalent total value. The reallocation of resources saved to earmarked programs is more acceptable than the reallocation to non-earmarked programs. In particular, respondents opted for a more immediate compensation from the elimination or reduction of the subsidy.",,,,,Public economics; Exit strategy; Behavioral economics; Endowment effect; Status quo bias; Economics; Valuation (finance); Experimental economics; Commodity; Subsidy,,,,,https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40045/1/MPRA_paper_40045.pdf https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2104997 http://core.ac.uk/display/12033176 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/40045/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12033176.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2104997,,10.2139/ssrn.2104997,1675257918,,0,002-383-975-295-878; 002-767-093-889-714; 005-107-894-544-949; 010-307-139-240-199; 017-489-838-067-043; 018-184-644-441-091; 022-355-357-537-144; 023-323-051-017-701; 026-763-178-093-099; 027-821-784-030-02X; 028-100-796-321-760; 028-482-117-809-681; 033-503-033-878-71X; 037-279-607-973-129; 038-523-104-433-065; 038-804-995-114-092; 040-596-934-801-698; 041-659-281-349-623; 050-016-939-840-628; 053-433-470-569-266; 057-708-501-650-100; 059-177-051-703-465; 068-538-131-068-665; 072-494-331-322-114; 075-145-567-875-237; 078-124-937-782-473; 082-478-016-809-785; 090-816-968-876-853; 093-539-423-650-420; 095-051-386-724-315; 097-609-628-961-317; 099-585-208-740-461; 101-859-588-779-696; 106-877-914-796-741; 108-626-252-296-372; 113-278-954-446-219; 116-275-534-296-096; 120-546-493-195-69X; 126-156-499-602-473; 142-111-815-120-945; 154-138-819-397-090; 154-700-258-521-973; 154-922-169-620-359; 170-333-764-950-656; 171-164-551-946-030; 173-523-486-683-725; 180-193-083-905-316; 182-999-715-795-182; 192-078-021-601-677,3

We aimed to demonstrate how this type of analysis can be used in medical decision making to assess whether psychiatrists were influenced in their treatment recommendations by information on the genotype of a patient, despite knowing the patient's response to treatment as measured by the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale. A patient's genetic information may be used to predict their response to therapy; such information, however, becomes redundant, and should not influence decisions, once a clinician knows the patient's actual response to treatment. Methods Sixty-seven psychiatrists were presented with patients' pre- or post-treatment scores on the Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale for two hypothetical treatments for schizophrenia. Psychiatrists were also informed whether the patient possessed a genotype linked to hyper-responsiveness to one of the treatments, and were asked to recommend one of these two treatments. Attribute nonattendance assessed whether the information on genotype influenced psychiatrists' treatment recommendations. Results Years of experience predicted whether psychiatrists were influenced by the genetic information. Psychiatrists with 1 year or less of experience had a 46% probability of considering genetic information, whereas psychiatrists with at least 15 years of experience had a lower probability (7%).

However, statistical tools for analyzing LCJ data are not widely available, have until now only had command- line interfaces, and require extensive interaction with the analyst. This prompted the Army to produce a new computer program that combines the functionality of several older command-line programs and has a more convenient windows interface. Exercising normal caution with new computer code, it is necessary to verify the new program to ensure that it correctly performs the desired tasks. This process requires a number of test cases: examples of each different class of results to be expected. Additionally, some of the changes in the program are expected to affect the precision of values for LCJ scales. Thus, since the values obtained with the new program are expected to be different than those obtained with the old one, it is necessary to verify that the results are equivalent. This paper describes the nature of the changes, the validation process, the nature of the validation data, and the results of the validation effort. The conclusion states that the new program does give results that are very similar to those obtained with the old programs.",,,,,Data mining; Test case; Psychophysics; Law of comparative judgment; Judgement; Computer program; Law enforcement; Statistical analysis; Computer science; Source code,,,,,,,,,48842467,,0,,0

Slot; Evelyn H. Kroesbergen; Jaccoline E. van ’t Noordende; Paul P.M. Leseman,"The present study compared eye movements and performance of a nine-year-old girl with Developmental Dyscalculia (DD) on a series of number line tasks to those of a group of typically developing (TD) children (n = 10), in order to answer the question whether eye-tracking data from number line estimation tasks can be a useful tool to discriminate between TD children and children with a number processing deficit. Quantitative results indicated that the child with dyscalculia performed worse on all symbolic number line tasks compared to the control group, indicated by a low linear fit (R2) and a low accuracy measured by mean percent absolute error. In contrast to the control group, her magnitude representations seemed to be better represented by a logarithmic than a linear fit. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on the data of the child with dyscalculia revealed more unidentifiable fixation patterns in the processing of multi-digit numbers and more dysfunctional estimation strategy use in one third of the estimation trials as opposed to approximately 10% in the control group. In line with her dyscalculia diagnosis, these results confirm the difficulties with spatially representing and manipulating numerosities on a number line, resulting in inflexible and inadequate estimation or processing strategies. It can be concluded from this case study that eye-tracking data can be used to discern different number processing and estimation strategies in TD children and children with a number processing deficit. Hence, eye-tracking data in combination with number line estimation tasks might be a valuable and promising addition to current diagnostic measures.",4,679,679,679,Statistics; Eye movement; Artificial intelligence; Number sense; Dyscalculia; Developmental Dyscalculia; Logarithm; Computer science; Linear regression; Eye tracking; Number line,diagnostic procedures; dyscalculia; eye-tracking; mapping; number line; number sense,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/26619666 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679/abstract https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Adspace.library.uu.nl%3A1874%2F286852 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/1874/286852/1/fpsyg-04-00679.pdf https://dspace.library.uu.nl/bitstream/handle/1874/286852/fpsyg-04-00679.pdf;sequence=1 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3787405 https://dspace.library.uu.nl/handle/1874/286852 https://repository.ubn.ru.nl/handle/2066/215946 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24098294 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82882457.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679,24098294,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00679,2139968699,PMC3787405,0,002-953-676-947-858; 003-626-441-665-213; 003-649-624-849-586; 004-030-636-268-081; 007-793-097-779-118; 007-859-644-103-125; 009-107-548-631-500; 010-294-410-265-319; 012-388-407-909-857; 015-456-782-384-125; 017-085-978-465-253; 019-562-955-392-946; 021-671-283-817-095; 021-901-356-850-672; 034-555-714-030-846; 037-404-408-305-152; 047-440-067-968-409; 048-238-179-561-256; 052-617-534-049-850; 065-794-300-944-51X; 069-062-026-178-120; 077-801-593-495-321; 078-936-746-314-363; 083-408-184-903-503; 083-735-110-745-424; 084-525-058-359-286; 085-710-808-170-767; 086-214-041-467-250; 089-957-068-429-39X; 096-075-148-761-076; 101-247-346-974-870; 108-396-581-453-18X; 109-356-419-856-140; 113-985-328-659-252; 115-198-196-801-586; 129-827-356-327-594; 143-234-910-364-952; 159-202-961-604-420,28

In this chapter, I seek answers to these questions in a perhaps unlikely place: the television series The Wire. Known for its unflinching realism, the crime drama narrates the intertwined lives of police, criminals, politicians, teachers and journalists in drug-plagued urban Baltimore. Yet even in the thick and quick of institutional dysfunction the drama portrays, human virtue springs forth and institutions (despite themselves) sometimes perform their roles. I begin this exploration of The Wire by drawing on Montesquieu and other political theorists to evaluate the problems facing state institutions – problems of diversity and principle as much as selfishness and power-mongering. I then turn to the prospects for virtue within modern institutions, developing and applying the system of Alasdair MacIntyre and paying particular attention to the role of narrative in cementing and integrating virtue.",11,,51,80,Political science; Narrative; Narrative ethics; Virtue; Social science; Professional ethics; Criminal justice ethics; Drama; Realism; Politics; Environmental ethics,,,,,https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/bitstream/10072/67256/1/98014_1.pdf https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/S1529-209620140000011003/full/html https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/67256 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/143853239.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/s1529-209620140000011003,,10.1108/s1529-209620140000011003,1000539161,,0,021-360-635-546-316; 045-505-856-206-281; 056-493-325-541-666; 060-538-602-287-469; 061-362-576-015-725; 066-396-973-780-620; 067-879-999-500-239; 073-981-815-903-454; 086-341-268-012-025; 089-472-901-622-785; 089-882-560-206-370; 103-184-153-448-417; 125-568-022-593-703; 140-469-055-509-379; 144-179-787-087-757; 169-303-482-162-78X,2

C. Van Den Honert,"The REMBRANDT system for multicriteria decision analysis consists of both the multiplicative variant of the AHP (which employs a method of pairwise comparative judgements by a decision maker to arrive at final impact scores for the alternatives under consideration) and SMART, the simple multiattribute rating technique (which utilizes direct rating of alternatives to achieve final impact scores). This paper examines the effect of imprecision or uncertainty in the decision maker's pairwise judgements or ratings of alternatives by expressing each pairwise judgement or rating as a probability distribution, and the structure of REMBRANDT's component models is exploited to derive interval judgements or interval ratings of the alternatives’ final impact scores. These interval judgements or interval ratings can be used to determine the probability of rank reversal amongst alternatives, i.e. to assess the stability of the final impact score vector. © 1998 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.",7,2,87,97,Statistics; Probability distribution; Pairwise comparison; Judgement; Decision maker; Impact score; Rank reversals in decision-making; Computer science; Multiplicative function; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1099-1360(199803)7:2<87::AID-MCDA175>3.0.CO;2-3/pdf https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1002%2F(SICI)1099-1360(199803)7:2%3C87::AID-MCDA175%3E3.0.CO;2-3 http://doi.wiley.com/10.1002/%28SICI%291099-1360%28199803%297%3A2%3C87%3A%3AAID-MCDA175%3E3.0.CO%3B2-3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/(sici)1099-1360(199803)7:2<87::aid-mcda175>3.0.co;2-3,,10.1002/(sici)1099-1360(199803)7:2<87::aid-mcda175>3.0.co;2-3,1999843088,,0,,5

Experiment 1 used the method of estimation and Experiment 2 the method of comparative judgement to assess the remembered duration of the interval. In both experiments the events were sentences which, depending on the provision of thematic information, could be organized either into a meaningful whole or as a sequence of semantically unrelated sentences. While the experimental manipulation affected memory and comprehension measures there was no effect on judgements of duration.

The performance of each observer was described by Thurstone’s discriminative processes and Bernoulli trial models which described empirical psychometric functions equally well. Although formally it was impossible to discriminate between these two models, treating observer as a counting device which measures a randomly selected subsample of all available motion elements had certain advantages. According to the Bernoulli trial model decisions about the global motion direction in a range of 12–800 elements were based on taking into account about 4 ± 2 random moving dot elements. This small number is not due to cancellation of the opposite motion vectors since the motion direction recognition performance did not improve after the compared motion directions were made orthogonal.

The present review summarizes and discusses evidence for language influences on the acquisition of the highly transparent structuring principles of digital-Arabic digits by means of its moderation through the transparency of the respective language’s number word system. In particular, the so-called inversion property (i.e., 24 named as ‘four and twenty’ instead of ‘twenty four’) was found to influence number processing in children not only in verbal but also in non-verbal numerical tasks. Additionally, there is first evidence suggesting that inversion-related difficulties may influence numerical processing longitudinally. Generally, language-specific influences in children’s numerical development are most pronounced for multi-digit numbers. Yet, there is currently only one study on three-digit number processing for German-speaking children. A direct comparison of additional new data from Italian-speaking children further corroborates the Whorfian claim that language impacts on all types of cognitive (number) processing as inversion-related interference was found most pronounced for German-speaking children. In sum, we conclude that numerical development may not be language-specific but seems to be moderated by language.",4,,480,480,Artificial intelligence; Cognition; Natural language processing; Structuring; Digit number; Computer science; Transparency (graphic); Inversion (meteorology); Arabic numerals; Moderation,inversion effects; language-moderated effects; multi-digit number comparison; number processing; numerical development,,,,http://core.ac.uk/display/25875644 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/pdf https://www.psycharchives.org/handle/20.500.12034/497 https://core.ac.uk/display/25875644 https://publikationen.uni-tuebingen.de/xmlui/handle/10900/41889 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/full http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23935585 https://www.psycharchives.org/bitstream/20.500.12034/497/1/1_fpsyg-04-00480.pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3733006/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82881500.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480,23935585,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00480,2071849949,PMC3733006,0,001-748-233-366-772; 006-969-591-574-820; 011-100-905-938-026; 018-314-977-284-103; 019-935-740-500-195; 025-402-033-432-459; 027-797-536-732-199; 028-950-609-255-958; 033-846-649-025-947; 035-452-245-818-650; 050-226-266-734-956; 051-686-139-649-760; 052-282-457-923-273; 055-735-581-155-767; 056-584-935-475-778; 064-745-429-405-288; 066-304-520-554-064; 066-943-557-532-951; 067-185-839-037-47X; 075-801-056-667-527; 076-198-381-713-008; 083-351-004-762-543; 083-408-184-903-503; 084-525-058-359-286; 086-908-853-487-093; 089-318-935-543-107; 116-975-634-585-183; 128-887-777-838-374; 133-092-718-573-072; 140-400-662-583-719; 148-696-185-975-512; 157-943-855-831-393; 170-052-077-415-28X,25

This metric that fits the psycho-visual data obtained by an experiment analyzes the perceived distortions produced by demosaicing algorithms. The demosaicing operation consists of a combination of color interpolation (CI) and anti-aliasing (AA) algorithms and converts a raw image acquired with a single sensor array, overlaid with a color filter array, into a full-color image. The most prominent artifact generated by demosaicing algorithms is called zipper. The zipper artifact is characterized by segments (zips) with an On–Off pattern. We perform psycho-visual experiments on a dataset of images that covers nine different degrees of distortions, obtained using three CI algorithms combined with two AA algorithms. We then propose our no-reference metric based on measures of blurriness, chromatic and achromatic distortions to fit the psycho-visual data. With this metric demosaicing algorithms could be evaluated and compared.",2012,1,123,,Zipper; Achromatic lens; Artificial intelligence; Color filter array; Chromatic scale; Demosaicing; No reference; Computer vision; Mathematics; Image quality; Sensor array,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81611330 http://www.asp.eurasipjournals.com/content/2012/1/123 https://boa.unimib.it/handle/10281/41839 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://paperity.org/p/4186377/a-no-reference-metric-for-demosaicing-artifacts-that-fits-psycho-visual-experiments https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/ejasp/ejasp2012.html#GaspariniMSG12 https://asp-eurasipjournals.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123 https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012EJASP2012..123G/abstract https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81611330.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123,,10.1186/1687-6180-2012-123,2103582296,,0,000-737-046-616-756; 004-965-530-533-346; 005-540-618-248-657; 007-013-754-270-777; 012-399-040-381-403; 017-292-361-222-51X; 020-238-704-091-197; 021-767-144-368-900; 023-520-642-563-715; 034-432-871-717-465; 034-714-588-288-533; 034-942-857-698-480; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-013-153-822-566; 046-830-941-464-010; 052-092-245-209-652; 056-411-353-738-94X; 062-221-140-574-750; 064-271-659-902-376; 064-941-440-539-584; 089-268-782-898-325; 090-919-377-086-982; 102-534-640-692-020; 106-371-503-655-997; 109-124-136-340-862; 109-903-837-162-782; 118-137-478-537-701; 148-278-836-260-544; 148-597-206-982-890; 173-018-515-976-299; 188-736-996-129-955,3

Callan; Ana I. Gheorghiu; William Matthews,"Across five studies, we found consistent evidence for the idea that personal relative deprivation (PRD), which refers to resentment stemming from the belief that one is deprived of deserved outcomes compared to others, uniquely contributes to materialism. In Study 1, self-reports of PRD positively predicted materialistic values over and above socioeconomic status, personal power, self-esteem, and emotional uncertainty. The experience of PRD starts with social comparison, and Studies 2 and 3 found that PRD mediated the positive relation between a tendency to make social comparisons of abilities and materialism. In Study 4, participants who learned that they had less (vs. similar) discretionary income than people like them reported a stronger desire for more money relative to donating more to charity. In Study 5, during a windfall-spending task, participants higher in PRD spent more on things they wanted relative to other spending categories (e.g., paying off debts).",56,2,373,392,Debt; Social status; Materialism; Socioeconomic status; Psychology; Social comparison theory; Consumer behaviour; Relative deprivation; Resentment; Social psychology,consumer behaviour; materialism; personal relative deprivation; social comparison; social status,"Adult; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Motivation; Personal Satisfaction; Power, Psychological; Self Concept; Social Class; Uncertainty; Young Adult",,Leverhulme Trust; Economic and Social Research Council,https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/11215279/Social_comparison_personal_relative_deprivation.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27878836 https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12176 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/social-comparison-personal-relative-deprivation-and-materialism(08b28788-430f-4756-9baf-5c5a5f1b8911).html https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/social-comparison-personal-relative-deprivation-and-materialism https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjso.12176 http://repository.essex.ac.uk/18214/ http://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/262090 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/bjso.12176 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27878836 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdf/10.1111/bjso.12176 https://cyberleninka.org/article/n/694601 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/74375062.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/bjso.12176,27878836,10.1111/bjso.12176,2551498008,PMC5484278,0,000-360-514-408-29X; 000-517-343-381-928; 001-383-131-749-503; 001-400-042-277-606; 004-853-761-708-602; 005-062-928-856-814; 006-086-152-011-293; 008-099-367-741-969; 008-628-647-679-259; 010-249-618-179-070; 011-587-706-238-913; 011-670-060-593-55X; 015-526-346-623-469; 015-636-956-947-919; 015-927-570-151-897; 017-161-738-125-868; 018-057-489-952-681; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-036-216-509-253; 023-251-704-202-593; 024-652-274-818-85X; 025-724-556-647-792; 027-633-256-532-036; 028-522-914-914-349; 029-053-023-130-054; 031-107-770-345-73X; 032-025-006-709-574; 032-115-532-650-719; 034-736-994-010-809; 036-893-381-358-37X; 038-937-808-224-704; 039-862-360-031-914; 047-024-487-891-169; 052-053-960-162-740; 052-684-034-162-590; 060-577-386-644-004; 060-787-744-628-035; 065-358-145-514-884; 067-273-911-484-101; 071-946-997-805-217; 072-927-335-796-502; 073-262-296-322-170; 076-170-356-078-589; 079-108-871-882-776; 079-554-517-641-187; 080-877-444-998-725; 086-215-959-595-920; 088-361-442-798-969; 102-255-932-276-035; 104-081-095-630-388; 108-058-094-921-36X; 114-615-906-848-062; 116-326-989-111-446; 125-715-569-537-446; 126-454-480-733-794; 128-705-101-271-89X; 132-578-094-443-168; 140-772-753-830-217; 150-372-244-980-17X; 151-324-787-046-842; 152-283-351-756-956; 164-348-466-925-780; 168-012-337-457-243; 185-126-281-331-802; 186-136-796-884-030,24

This paper explores a quite different method of assessment using ‘Adaptive Comparative Judgement’ (ACJ) that was developed within a research project at Goldsmiths University of London between 2004 and 2010. The method was developed into a tool that enabled judges to distinguish better/worse performances not by allocating numbers through mark schemes, but rather by direct, holistic, judgement. The tool was successfully deployed through a series of national and international research and development exercises. But game-changing innovations are never flaw-less first time out (Golley, Jet: Frank Whittle and the Invention of the Jet Engine, Datum Publishing, Liphook Hampshire, 2009; Dyson, Against the odds: an autobiography, Texere Publishing, Knutsford Cheshire, 2001) and a series of careful investigations resulted in a problem being identified within the workings of ACJ (Bramley, Investigating the reliability of Adaptive Comparative Judgment, Cambridge Assessment Research Report, UK, Cambridge, 2015). The issue was with the ‘adaptive’ component of the algorithm that, under certain conditions, appeared to exaggerate the reliability statistic. The problem was ‘worked’ by the software company running ACJ and a solution found. This paper reports the whole sequence of events—from the original innovation, through deployment, the emergent problem, and the resulting solution that was published at an international conference (Rangel Smith and Lynch in: PATT36 International Conference. Research & Practice in Technology Education: Perspectives on Human Capacity and Development, 2018) and subsequently deployed within a modified ACJ algorithm.",,,1,15,Software deployment; Engineering management; Odds; Publishing; Educational technology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Computer science; Science education; Technology education,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,,10.1007/s10798-021-09654-w,3131726837,,0,003-019-903-218-043; 006-719-044-652-648; 007-775-768-494-369; 012-145-631-812-551; 012-962-168-631-344; 015-035-210-409-280; 022-886-709-886-069; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 055-875-865-161-135; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 074-813-203-051-83X; 075-548-610-945-867; 080-893-480-467-569; 083-130-316-203-709; 091-465-380-379-025; 106-681-332-176-644; 108-462-313-507-607; 119-113-819-818-430; 126-875-389-752-711; 133-529-167-198-85X; 149-208-961-050-864; 160-928-885-215-092; 169-132-973-382-548,0

Next the weights of the decision alternatives are calculated for each criterion separately. Lastly, the fuzzy final scores of the alternatives are determined by an appropriate aggregationm of the calculated weights. We will show that our modified method, in contrast with the original one, yields weights which are optimal with respect to the logarithmic regression function. We also present a version of our method with geometric ratio scales, rather than Saaty's equi-distant scale, to quantify the gradations of human comparative judgement.

Louviere; David Pihlens; Richard T. Carson,"Abstract Disagreement among researchers regarding types of optimal choice experiments is often best seen as resulting from differences in the set of assumptions researchers are willing to make about the underlying data generating process. Much of the current debate may have confused, rather than enlightened applied researchers because the underlying source of the debate lacks transparency. We argue that this debate would be better served if it were much more closely tied to the large existing literature on optimal design of experiments, where many of the issues currently being discussed have long been examined. We further argue that the current debate misses several key issues that are likely to be important to making progress in understanding the role played by experimental designs in applied settings of interest in economics, marketing and transportation research.",4,1,1,8,Economics; Applied research; Optimal design of experiments; Discrete choice experiment; Key issues; Design of experiments; Management science; Transparency (graphic),,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1755534513700162 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82225887.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70016-2,,10.1016/s1755-5345(13)70016-2,2080420008,,0,000-749-390-969-022; 001-240-622-026-846; 001-362-199-882-05X; 004-135-383-805-678; 005-290-905-754-326; 005-747-762-166-742; 007-148-759-154-669; 010-678-441-963-454; 011-419-515-373-757; 012-743-153-762-931; 015-038-870-089-319; 018-269-445-638-29X; 023-521-674-630-577; 024-677-580-110-025; 029-604-920-937-905; 030-431-704-957-664; 035-776-610-863-582; 047-077-704-250-798; 049-724-994-457-842; 055-164-144-162-540; 057-612-005-514-613; 057-657-809-679-383; 063-123-327-601-576; 065-409-107-548-650; 082-755-371-884-846; 084-506-566-559-379; 090-531-059-792-864; 091-481-036-414-936; 095-033-878-232-844; 095-343-050-791-375; 102-078-821-391-095; 104-356-422-378-379; 105-928-819-975-021; 106-394-115-454-597; 113-278-954-446-219; 114-685-371-109-418; 115-647-590-504-476; 118-020-403-059-275; 119-000-371-950-394; 121-690-817-955-88X; 129-508-900-702-573; 149-689-713-843-54X; 151-883-772-833-131; 155-437-147-774-098; 157-428-181-292-496; 171-070-080-551-851,54

This quality framework is meant to evaluate the perceptual impact of a compression algorithm or an error prone communication channel on the quality of an image. The image might go through various enhancement or compression algorithms, resulting in a different -- but not necessarily worse -- image. In other words, we will measure quality but not fidelity to the original picture.While modern colour appearance models are able to predict the perception of colourfulness of simple patches on uniform backgrounds, there is no agreement on how to measure the overall colourfulness of a picture of a natural scene. We try to quantify the colourfulness in natural images to perceptually qualify the effect that processing or coding has on colour. We set up a psychophysical category scaling experiment, and ask people to rate images using 7 categories of colourfulness. We then fit a metric to the results, and obtain a correlation of over 90% with the experimental data. The metric is meant to be used real time on video streams.

Some of these refugees do not receive asylum, but are not deported. Instead they are detained, or denied basic rights of residency, some forced into enclosed camps. Hoping to escape such conditions, they wish to return to unsafe countries, and ask for help from non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. In such cases, should NGOs and the UN assist refugees to return? Drawing on original data gathered in South Sudan, and existing data from around the world, I argue that they should assist with return if certain conditions are met. First, the UN and NGOs must try to put an end to coercive conditions before helping with return. Secondly, helping with return must not encourage the government to expand the use of coercive policies to encourage more to return. Finally, NGOs and the UN must ensure that refugees are fully informed of the risks of returning. Organizations must either conduct research in countries of origin or lobby the government to allow refugees to visit their countries of origin before making a final decision.</jats:p>",48,4,855,875,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42486589.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0007123416000193,,10.1017/s0007123416000193,,,0,000-798-385-117-248; 004-781-226-840-724; 008-057-282-387-504; 011-790-731-634-460; 021-683-127-575-109; 024-713-857-387-349; 026-834-398-620-626; 028-006-316-891-625; 032-999-523-276-311; 041-032-922-957-575; 041-872-597-716-488; 051-587-316-836-353; 056-597-268-405-233; 061-420-412-232-865; 062-648-039-871-032; 070-746-075-270-815; 071-185-701-013-576; 075-494-006-059-657; 078-316-958-840-27X; 083-879-198-869-984; 084-887-749-688-319; 087-674-981-111-995; 089-723-940-688-019; 089-846-844-967-894; 094-408-345-428-07X; 101-020-158-731-648; 103-914-554-428-902; 112-105-892-050-603; 112-378-803-995-829; 117-582-815-801-307; 136-390-536-763-507; 140-103-158-028-862; 148-425-181-710-045; 159-419-297-422-289; 165-028-152-386-001; 181-663-620-816-678,4

If so, which changes in institutions and practices can mitigate it? Empirically oriented scholars who ask such questions often use as a yardstick the normative principle that people significantly affected by a decision should be able to take part in reaching that decision. This “all affected principle” is also endorsed by prominent political theorists. However, its most logically consistent interpretation seems so demanding that it casts doubt on the principle’s usefulness to guide the assessment of real-world situations, since it appears to require that virtually everyone in the world should have a say on any proposal or any proposal for proposals. The argument presented here intends to rescue the principle as a tool for empirical assessments of real-world situations by stressing its role in comparative judgements and especially by showing that its implications are not too expansive and/or indeterminate, once we take into account that certain types of prior decisions significantly restrict the agenda of other decisions in a systematic way. The theoretical guidance for empirical research offered in the first part of the article is then illustrated with an application to global child labor policies.",9,2,171,202,Positive economics; Empirical research; Sociology; Law; Global governance; Democratic deficit; restrict; Normative; Global politics; Democracy; Politics,,,,,http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/68641/ https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/international-theory/article/how-to-diagnose-democratic-deficits-in-global-politics-the-use-of-the-allaffected-principle/70B31B3041273EEC35CBC3087B1DED0E https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/77615241.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s1752971916000312,,10.1017/s1752971916000312,2587615478,,0,000-377-433-647-687; 001-037-644-594-744; 003-763-800-545-223; 008-624-319-748-069; 010-382-032-415-462; 011-922-492-451-959; 015-295-902-438-729; 015-512-428-004-891; 015-726-543-289-101; 017-091-820-778-832; 019-972-458-677-993; 021-640-941-453-878; 024-025-349-415-906; 029-270-986-463-32X; 030-286-552-306-433; 031-552-386-486-090; 031-869-268-109-345; 032-339-283-554-891; 038-059-348-935-436; 040-510-823-368-430; 041-944-562-250-120; 045-062-600-450-838; 048-941-440-430-001; 050-583-713-086-563; 055-661-471-393-407; 058-418-839-835-226; 059-228-181-534-070; 060-302-954-904-087; 061-042-205-542-54X; 065-621-298-827-190; 067-858-238-034-39X; 070-061-271-729-185; 070-384-346-108-129; 071-846-033-952-37X; 072-295-729-156-396; 072-673-673-878-677; 073-676-954-587-817; 074-486-667-083-391; 074-651-377-292-837; 074-934-022-453-400; 077-121-151-064-947; 077-336-288-229-704; 077-558-325-268-846; 078-583-525-582-785; 078-717-187-086-05X; 078-876-415-835-891; 079-870-177-530-644; 081-093-023-073-776; 081-219-715-793-011; 084-053-345-994-79X; 089-883-878-301-479; 093-905-749-742-699; 093-959-056-884-540; 096-268-921-993-407; 097-733-016-817-777; 100-101-751-567-47X; 100-453-399-301-080; 101-726-319-189-111; 105-617-887-162-075; 110-690-929-169-868; 111-374-479-811-973; 115-545-817-148-983; 115-747-284-384-11X; 116-646-983-776-423; 119-932-554-530-405; 123-660-730-843-434; 123-809-751-896-984; 125-508-710-720-919; 126-374-559-808-461; 127-110-388-818-514; 127-221-699-644-293; 127-354-078-751-570; 127-605-345-562-541; 129-171-629-586-585; 132-246-113-722-525; 136-777-514-856-397; 138-577-513-494-968; 143-190-553-105-992; 144-352-344-076-430; 144-548-497-830-224; 145-461-207-390-705; 150-469-352-085-755; 154-642-333-826-10X; 159-851-067-853-131; 160-874-392-927-162; 162-403-633-000-387; 165-350-037-132-642; 169-021-092-759-104; 175-399-447-510-976; 184-679-309-048-077; 186-503-896-179-04X; 186-979-614-689-169; 187-804-272-532-859; 191-431-238-430-723; 197-331-806-292-016,11

In keeping with the government’s rhetoric of evidence-based policy, a plethora of different research reports on specific youth sport initiatives were commissioned. The purpose of this study was to synthesise relevant reports to better understand the implementation of Labour’s youth sport policies and to consider the extent to which insights drawn from these reports could extend understanding of effective approaches to improving young people’s participation in sport and physical activity. Inspired by a ‘realist synthesis’ approach, the research methodology focused attention towards the mechanisms, contexts and outcomes of youth sport initiatives. An iterative six-stage approach guided the identification and analysis of 13 research reports and enabled refinement of an initial progra...",8,1,67,90,Public policy; Rhetoric; Government; Political science; Evidence-based policy; Physical activity; Corporate governance; Public relations; Modernization theory; Sport management,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19406940.2015.1063528 https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20163096262 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/15123/ http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/19406940.2015.1063528 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42126185.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/19406940.2015.1063528,,10.1080/19406940.2015.1063528,2159973334,,0,000-961-480-505-06X; 008-708-282-441-810; 011-323-539-062-21X; 016-481-292-778-093; 016-833-347-470-683; 017-890-309-911-158; 020-598-313-425-646; 020-709-101-313-553; 021-370-840-455-586; 030-761-811-620-09X; 030-924-566-017-783; 031-077-723-278-605; 032-935-753-101-004; 033-351-628-743-689; 034-312-023-741-108; 034-671-808-669-841; 039-632-838-415-578; 045-655-609-577-02X; 049-455-265-188-037; 051-940-607-072-642; 052-111-270-535-880; 053-131-791-817-554; 055-366-142-681-625; 058-060-624-841-22X; 066-439-899-592-249; 068-682-524-404-46X; 077-321-469-244-282; 090-510-711-822-655; 090-738-798-462-728; 104-145-934-392-692; 108-972-870-570-799; 110-871-068-555-048; 124-571-787-503-256; 129-817-347-297-996; 134-610-344-339-348; 134-957-763-627-259; 137-413-640-941-356; 138-142-315-567-844; 138-593-881-982-308; 142-898-872-010-066; 149-064-419-571-299; 154-278-694-372-723; 154-803-337-237-497; 155-635-471-489-536; 156-313-198-595-403; 158-934-624-334-500; 174-218-441-139-414; 179-764-967-448-203; 185-394-393-368-539; 191-747-840-229-193; 196-456-237-443-891; 199-130-756-971-927,7

This contribution introduces an approach for retailers and producers to estimate optimal prices for wine exhibition awards. A case study has been employed in cooperation with a major Czech wine company to investigate the practical application of the method. Wine exhibition awards are found to be among the important factors affecting consumer preferences for bottled wine. A Conjoint experiment allowed for estimating the relative importance of selected wine exhibitions as award origins and for determining the partial utilities of selected awards (medals). Calculating the individual price equivalents for those awards and three selected wines enables the estimation of prices for maximum turnover.

The aim of the present study is to examine whether listeners with varying degrees of experience with (HI) children’s speech perceive a difference in the overall speech quality of seven-year-old NH children and their HI peers who received a device before the age of two. Method Short speech samples of seven children with NH, seven children with an acoustic hearing aid (HA) and seven children with a cochlear implant (CI) were judged by three groups of listeners (audiologists, primary school teachers and inexperienced listeners) in a comparative judgement task. In this task, listeners compared stimuli in pairs and decided which stimulus sounded better, leading to a ranking of the stimuli according to their overall speech quality. Results The ranking showed that the overall speech quality differed considerably for HI and NH children. The latter group had a significantly higher overall speech quality than HI children. In the group of HI children, children with CI were ranked higher than children with HA. Moreover, length of device use was found to have a significant effect in the group of children with CI: longer device experience led to better ratings. This effect was significantly less strong in HA children. No significant differences were found between the three groups of listeners. Conclusion Listeners agree that the speech of NH children sounds better than the speech of HI children.

Milfont; Robert Thomson,"The spatial and temporal reach of contemporary environmental problems are unparalleled. Collective efforts to address global environmental problems are required but actions to tackle these problems demand initial recognition of their seriousness. Cross-cultural research has shown a reliable bias in comparative judgements about the severity of environmental problems for geographically distant places, with environmental issues perceived to be more severe “there” than “here.” The robustness of this effect may have unwarranted consequences since perceiving environmental problems as being worse elsewhere might lead individuals to not take actions in their locality. We conducted a within-country study to test whether this spatial bias would emerge for samples from all Brazilian states (k = 27, N = 4,265; 85% female; Age M = 24; Age SD = 9.67). Providing further support for a biased comparative judgement, we observed that the severity of environmental problems was judged as worse at the country level than at the state level (mean spatial bias score among Brazilian states = 0.54). Only 2% of the variation in spatial bias was attributable to across-state differences. By replicating cross-cultural findings within a single nation, our findings provide further support for the prevalence and generalizability of biased comparative judgements about the severity of environmental problems. We discuss critical future directions for spatial bias research.",15,3,1,22,Psychology; Generalizability theory; Judgement; Seriousness; Locality; Spatial bias; Country study; Country level; Social psychology,,,,,https://researchcommons.waikato.ac.nz/handle/10289/13936 https://spb.psychopen.eu/index.php/spb/article/view/3019,http://dx.doi.org/10.32872/spb.3019,,10.32872/spb.3019,3097479563,,0,003-162-826-173-946; 007-387-984-358-121; 008-388-217-158-023; 009-002-729-195-09X; 012-419-306-168-454; 014-227-262-998-048; 014-543-416-581-937; 015-015-967-000-921; 015-279-757-665-318; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-784-106-691-852; 021-092-214-568-498; 021-366-926-125-21X; 027-165-979-247-138; 029-701-135-194-792; 031-322-591-873-547; 039-044-601-310-689; 041-754-833-497-938; 053-148-800-864-725; 057-487-507-338-63X; 057-761-715-276-049; 059-232-020-439-664; 063-421-934-954-520; 066-963-286-239-144; 068-978-268-194-215; 079-442-117-746-119; 084-366-706-963-962; 087-757-249-478-204; 090-603-568-844-247; 092-525-901-780-403; 099-376-165-252-503; 102-302-173-912-799; 102-382-778-178-26X; 107-854-421-865-889; 118-435-299-952-243; 121-713-335-254-465; 127-711-993-472-113; 142-619-634-658-858; 188-876-569-103-050,0

A sample of 70 women completed a four-part survey after learning the benign breast biopsy diagnosis. The survey consisted of an Information Needs Questionnaire, Mishel Uncertainty in Illness Scale--Community Form, State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, and a Demographic Questionnaire. Before the study, nine information needs were identified in a focus group composed of women (n = 9) who had a benign breast biopsy. The nine information needs were arranged in 36 pairs in the Information Needs Questionnaire. Profiles of information needs were developed through Statistical Analysis Systems analysis using Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgement--Case V. The most important information need of women who underwent a benign breast biopsy was knowing when they would learn the diagnosis. The next four information needs were categorized as information about the risks of developing breast cancer. Information about follow-up and diagnostic tests were less important than information about the threat of breast cancer. Women experienced heightened uncertainty and anxiety levels related to the benign breast biopsy experience.

This may be a justifiable complaint only as far as the implementation of large-scale projects is concerned. In this paper, it is argued that the success and relevance of micro projects such as urban housing targeted to a particular group of workers can be improved immensely with the incorporation of the perceptions of the target group. Thurstone's law of comparative judgement case V is applied in this paper to the stated preferences for housing of over 400 respondents in Kisumu town, Kenya, with a view to illustrating the gap that exists between revealed and stated preferences for residential location in general. Then Generalised Linear Interactive Modelling is used to estimate the relative importance of different factors in determining peoples' preference for housing. This paper concludes that the so-called revealed housing preference is totally irrelevant in the prediction of where people would like to live. Stated-preference analysis, on the other hand, is demonstrated to be of tremendous planning utility.",20,3,269,278,Public economics; Thurstone scale; Economics; Perception; Judgement; Complaint; Residential location; Economic growth; Developing country,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/001671858990002X,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0016-7185(89)90002-x,,10.1016/0016-7185(89)90002-x,2094702419,,0,001-563-551-703-26X; 012-564-529-970-55X; 025-980-150-959-561; 028-519-504-877-760; 028-675-484-299-733; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-616-049-977-19X; 049-716-836-354-370; 052-420-832-442-002; 058-966-540-689-604; 073-562-690-045-065; 076-514-126-279-875; 100-789-379-591-534; 128-975-860-345-474; 139-759-017-944-193; 143-557-830-645-70X; 155-635-073-239-275; 198-901-384-502-690,3

It is an attempt to ensure that the proposal which arises is accepted and that the resulting artefact itself suited to its purposes in practice. Recent surveys of Evaluation show that most methods require quantitative and explicit attributes. Always a significant part of the attributes of design proposals is qualitative. Therefore we need some study that convert qualitative attributes into quantitative scale values, because in many cases con\ulcornerclusions can be drawn about the order of the overall value of the design proposals. Following to Thurstone's psychological scaling methods, attributive values are assigned by ruting scale methods, met, hod of rank-order and method of paired comparisons. The problem of psycho\ulcornerlogical scaling is then to determine whether the stimuli can be ordered on a psychological continuum with respect to the degree of the attributes each possesses. The law of comparative judgement assumes that for a given stimulus there is associated a most frequently aroused or modal discriminal process on a psychological continuum. This paper is based upon the premise that the modal discriminul process will also be the same as the mean or median of the distribution.The objective of this paper is to argue for an acceptance of qualitative approaches to the evalua\ulcornertion of Design as a complement to the existing quantitative techniques. The scale values of 10 attri\ulcornerbutes \ulcorner(1) originality, (2) aesthetics, (3) satisfaction, (4) effeciency, (5) function, (6) size, (7) texture, (8) simplicity, (9) symbol, and (10) facility) in case of TV sets are obtained and their interactions are examined.】",2,1,117,130,Symbol; Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Natural language processing; Judgement; Originality; Premise; Attributive; Mathematics; Modal; Scaling,,,,,http://scholar.ndsl.kr/schArticleDetail.do?cn=JAKO198911920713791,http://scholar.ndsl.kr/schArticleDetail.do?cn=JAKO198911920713791,,,2490589220,,0,,0

A number of tools and methodological frameworks are available — such as rating systems, traditional decision-making techniques, checklists, and different evaluation frameworks and models. While these tools are highly valuable, some practical issues remain unsolved. There is also a need for more standardized tools to appraise the sustainability of transport projects. This paper is a presentation of a review on the current assessment tools of sustainability applied to transport infrastructure projects. The preliminary part of the paper is an explanatory and comparative analysis of the tools and methods in terms of their effectiveness to appraise sustainability.

Gilmore; Matthew Inglis; Ian Jones,"The importance of improving students’ understanding of core concepts in mathematics is well established. However, assessing the impact of different teaching interventions designed to improve students’ conceptual understanding requires the validation of adequate measures. Here we propose a novel method of measuring conceptual understanding based on comparative judgement (CJ). Contrary to traditional instruments, the CJ approach allows test questions for any topic to be developed rapidly. In addition, CJ does not require a detailed rubric to represent conceptual understanding of a topic, as it is instead based on the collective knowledge of experts. In the current studies, we compared CJ to already established instruments to measure three topics in mathematics: understanding the use of p-values in statistics, understanding derivatives in calculus, and understanding the use of letters in algebra. The results showed that CJ was valid as compared to established instruments, and achieved high reliability. We conclude that CJ is a quick and efficient alternative method of measuring conceptual understanding in mathematics and could therefore be particularly useful in intervention studies.",2,2,141,164,Rubric; Psychology; Judgement; Alternative methods; Intervention studies; Management science; Collective intelligence,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9368609 https://www.dora.dmu.ac.uk/xmlui/handle/2086/11972 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40753-016-0024-3.pdf https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/handle/2134/20444 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3 https://paperity.org/p/76526064/measuring-conceptual-understanding-using-comparative-judgement https://www.rasch.org.uk/assets/papers/9/cj.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_using_comparative_judgement/9368609 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/42484555.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3,,10.1007/s40753-016-0024-3,2293494073,,0,004-257-050-498-919; 017-720-121-667-139; 019-372-839-061-325; 020-097-247-590-604; 020-326-308-142-423; 021-386-533-570-898; 025-815-512-671-284; 026-126-511-819-948; 026-140-166-599-34X; 027-043-806-375-152; 033-896-251-435-132; 034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-995-191-505-48X; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 059-517-253-696-88X; 066-908-670-161-319; 078-596-058-399-553; 091-354-181-661-739; 103-589-015-928-645; 106-166-641-836-689; 109-604-178-712-209; 122-718-932-710-050; 136-468-250-342-464; 179-817-776-513-638; 197-534-306-708-732,11
040-636-934-574-740,The perception of gloss: A review,2014-11-08,2014,journal article,Vision research,18785646; 00426989,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,A.C. Chadwick; Robert W. Kentridge,"Gloss is a relatively little studied visual property of objects’ surfaces. The earliest recorded scientific reference to gloss appears to have been by Ingersoll in 1921: studies at this time were based on the assumption that gloss could be understood as an inherent physical property of a surface, and the priority was to devise a satisfactory method and scale to measure it reliably. As awareness of the complexity of perception grew, efforts were made to distinguish different types of gloss, although these generally still took the form of a search for objective physical measures to be solved within the visual system by means of inverse optics. It became more widely recognised approximately 20 years ago that models of gloss perception based on inverse optics were intractable and failed to explain experimental findings adequately. A temporary decline in the number of published studies followed; however the last decade or so has seen a renewal of interest in the perception of gloss, in an effort to map what is now understood to be a complex interaction of variables including illumination, surface properties and observer. This appears to have been driven by a number of factors, as the study of gloss re-emerged from research into other surface properties such as colour and texture, with technological advances paving the way for new experimental techniques and measurements. This review describes the main strands of research, tracking the changes in approach and theory which have triggered new avenues of research, to the current state of knowledge.",109,,221,235,Cognitive psychology; Perception; Gloss (annotation); Visual property; Computer science; Observer (quantum physics),Gloss; Materials; Perception; Vision,"Cues; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Psychophysics; Surface Properties; Visual Perception/physiology",,"Durham University and Procter & Gamble, Technical Centres",https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698914002594 http://dro.dur.ac.uk/15559/ https://core.ac.uk/display/42126624 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25448119 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698914002594 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82392312.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2014.10.026,25448119,10.1016/j.visres.2014.10.026,2057788268,,1,000-889-285-212-68X; 001-060-521-763-259; 001-281-280-236-499; 001-740-766-105-501; 002-235-282-611-87X; 004-273-381-418-960; 005-106-437-816-609; 005-594-408-235-94X; 010-440-297-837-137; 011-231-961-118-102; 011-554-784-863-502; 012-415-225-403-397; 014-136-157-239-951; 014-617-435-588-906; 014-678-747-012-753; 014-959-595-091-886; 015-059-238-164-963; 015-356-781-115-89X; 015-377-641-815-870; 016-407-932-485-93X; 016-909-110-659-726; 017-440-219-046-764; 019-611-258-648-73X; 019-675-775-690-824; 020-227-716-553-279; 022-686-731-308-250; 024-008-016-105-729; 025-962-850-904-466; 029-036-998-845-637; 029-682-934-418-755; 030-945-177-930-272; 031-099-917-394-118; 033-544-571-821-842; 033-785-715-909-067; 034-055-612-612-932; 036-222-477-471-353; 037-294-563-396-758; 038-730-238-120-592; 040-617-022-137-579; 043-102-304-781-051; 043-270-431-809-670; 044-659-581-120-248; 044-838-921-044-899; 047-830-189-254-889; 048-647-652-745-657; 051-099-535-076-304; 051-971-676-538-516; 053-849-676-025-706; 054-631-058-087-998; 055-329-988-615-426; 059-164-060-943-724; 060-963-638-617-762; 061-878-397-223-77X; 062-214-408-732-33X; 063-477-238-634-497; 069-640-089-256-765; 069-669-678-660-968; 070-891-514-486-548; 073-055-423-181-218; 074-247-831-141-269; 076-205-948-665-880; 079-194-398-896-999; 084-149-492-732-884; 084-173-407-708-805; 090-407-633-886-77X; 095-587-847-736-219; 096-922-153-864-285; 098-469-909-527-853; 102-568-007-518-006; 104-610-593-352-254; 109-163-419-534-466; 116-036-012-870-072; 116-210-576-740-805; 117-724-967-342-710; 117-953-750-568-451; 144-477-353-644-523; 150-025-633-144-240; 152-138-932-463-878; 154-466-203-098-861; 156-180-185-089-062; 157-577-491-411-621; 161-021-076-909-95X; 171-155-037-102-80X; 180-026-374-133-231; 185-333-747-621-492,60

These are effective to measure teachers’ reasoning but are inadequate to measure noticing in an uninfluenced way. Video-based comparative judgement (CJ) is presented as a holistic alternative to measure teachers’ noticing. This study investigates the validity of a CJ misfit measure as an indicator of teachers’ noticing. Analysis on data of 492 teachers in 23 schools through a multivariate multilevel framework substantiate the validity of the misfit measure and provide insight in the relationships between teachers’ noticing and reasoning for inclusive classrooms.",98,,257,271,Mathematics education; Judgement; Differentiated instruction; Professional vision; Video based; Assessment methods; Cognitive load; Physical education,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8629649 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883035518323759,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijer.2019.09.004,,10.1016/j.ijer.2019.09.004,2976146415,,0,000-132-012-124-030; 003-188-947-757-126; 003-287-668-745-978; 005-925-916-359-467; 007-598-909-438-594; 009-290-795-157-103; 009-344-052-394-918; 009-631-573-859-890; 010-351-079-014-496; 012-971-408-472-122; 014-178-357-512-399; 018-269-445-638-29X; 025-665-159-830-801; 030-619-394-339-83X; 032-113-282-979-159; 032-182-993-297-073; 035-325-670-176-458; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-520-088-075-527; 040-241-846-826-833; 044-785-959-174-932; 047-723-153-701-911; 048-091-210-665-560; 049-222-787-035-049; 058-505-623-532-694; 061-583-679-577-148; 062-084-670-744-560; 063-513-633-123-756; 065-195-484-126-997; 065-981-385-911-496; 066-908-670-161-319; 069-929-829-230-278; 070-070-847-038-059; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-527-957-682-219; 076-050-960-166-845; 076-388-093-729-15X; 077-080-474-170-543; 079-347-668-877-398; 082-680-397-981-747; 087-991-691-200-809; 099-014-289-384-34X; 102-955-514-174-383; 115-102-354-884-075; 115-439-389-997-233; 116-082-116-295-815; 118-658-396-717-120; 118-978-792-014-286; 119-731-133-007-623; 123-048-918-232-925; 125-606-263-553-977; 126-292-923-823-985; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-659-660-814-933; 132-892-622-955-366; 141-912-822-122-205; 142-295-997-236-840; 145-693-014-792-954; 146-526-950-533-937; 147-709-030-363-419; 149-973-083-062-025; 151-046-637-132-457; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 152-574-181-038-31X; 192-368-533-735-324; 198-024-145-226-631,1

Murrell,"The relationship between autobiographical memory, depression and quality of life (QoL) was investigated in a study of 30 persons with severe neurodisability resulting from multiple sclerosis. Sixty percent (n = 18) of patients were found to have deficits in autobiographical memory (AMI) for incidents in their earlier life; these deficits were associated with significant impairments in personal semantic memory of facts from their past life. Patients with impaired autobiographical memory who had been diagnosed for longer than 21 years reported significantly better QoL (SF-36: Role Physical) than those diagnosed more recently, or those with normal autobiographical memory; patients who had been diagnosed for longer were also significantly less depressed than patients diagnosed more recently. Patients with normal autobiographical memory reported the highest levels of depression (HADS) and the lowest levels of QoL (Role Physical).

According to realism, political philosophy must reveal the specific standards internal to the political practice of handling power appropriately and as it develops in actual circumstances. Framed in those terms, the debate evokes the idea that political power itself is lacking normativity until such time as norms are devised that govern its use. In contrast, this essay identifies a normative dimension internal to (the conquest and exercise of) power. Power depends on recognition and support in the form of belief.

It is motivated by policy problems. New causal parameters are defined and identified to address specific policy problems. Economists embrace a scientific approach to causality and model the preferences and choices of agents to infer subjective (agent) evaluations as well as objective outcomes. Anticipated and realized subjective and objective outcomes are distinguished. Models for simultaneous causality are developed. The paper contrasts the Neyman-Rubin model of causality with the econometric approach,,,,,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/39397453.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1920/wp.cem.2008.0108,,10.1920/wp.cem.2008.0108,,,0,,3
041-567-856-615-665,The effects of clinical experience on nurses' critical event risk assessment judgements in paper based and high fidelity simulated conditions: a comparative judgement analysis.,2010-10-12,2010,journal article,International journal of nursing studies,1873491x; 00207489,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Huiqin Yang; Carl Thompson,"Abstract Background Paper based simulated patients are widely used to analyse nurses' clinical judgements. However, developments in the physical simulation of clinical environments offer exciting, but relatively underexploited, opportunities for exploring nurses' judgements. Critical event risk assessment is an element of acute care practice which lends itself well to simulation and in which more clinical experience is often assumed to lead to better quality judgements. Objectives To model nurses' judgements of critical event risk using physical and paper simulation and to examine whether improving fidelity via physical clinical simulation impacts on the apparent benefits of clinical experience on nurses' judgement performance. Design A comparative clinical judgement analysis. Setting A university in Northern England. Methods Sixty-three nursing students and 34 experienced nurses made dichotomous risk assessment judgements (""at risk"" or ""not at risk"") in response to 25 paper and physical simulated scenarios. These were randomly generated from a dataset of real patient case records. Clinical outcomes (the judgement criteria) for a ‘correct' judgement were derived from the same case records. Logistic regression models were constructed to derive statistics for each nurse representing various measures of judgement performance: achievement ( r a ), consistency ( R s ) and clinical information use ( G ). These statistics were known as Lens Model statistics (from the psychological theory of Brunswik's Lens Model of judgement). Performance measures for novice and experienced nurses were compared. Results No significant differences in judgemental achievement ( r a ) between experienced nurses and students were observed in either paper or high fidelity clinical simulations. Similarly, there were no significant differences in the nurses' abilities to correctly match the ways they synthesised clinical information with the optimum synthesis required by the task (policy matching) ( G ). When faced with ""paper patients"" experienced nurses exercised more cognitive control/consistency ( R s ) than students ( P =0.04). However, this heightened control in experienced nurses was absent when those same nurses made judgements in the higher fidelity clinical simulation environment. Conclusion Clinical experience made no difference to nurses' judgement achievement (accuracy) in either the lower fidelity paper scenarios or the higher fidelity setting of the clinical simulation unit. The significant impact of clinical experience on judgement consistency was negated by the increases in fidelity offered through clinical simulation.",48,4,429,437,Risk assessment; Logistic regression; Cognition; Fidelity; Judgement; Acute care; Psychological Theory; Medicine; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Simulated patient,,England; Nurses; Risk Assessment,,,https://www.journalofnursingstudies.com/article/S0020-7489(10)00311-1/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20943223 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0020748910003111,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.09.010,20943223,10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2010.09.010,2012469528,,0,000-645-751-448-200; 001-136-720-724-197; 002-113-982-958-529; 003-103-431-474-664; 003-137-099-327-536; 003-374-204-626-722; 004-860-580-891-183; 005-553-153-856-945; 008-528-770-009-789; 011-479-043-571-011; 013-584-405-490-380; 019-330-009-722-264; 021-809-146-501-114; 023-322-924-956-376; 024-645-010-420-500; 024-909-552-405-854; 027-105-627-680-953; 027-534-274-534-103; 027-969-183-626-435; 028-005-187-875-797; 028-702-267-468-802; 029-559-062-367-562; 029-982-640-664-031; 033-520-463-196-553; 036-672-014-157-673; 036-905-294-612-240; 038-511-758-527-994; 040-714-141-223-423; 040-856-784-955-402; 041-346-082-360-961; 045-309-145-440-807; 053-937-194-579-503; 055-556-746-685-51X; 055-938-198-128-125; 057-635-746-537-806; 065-750-806-145-489; 066-717-399-850-907; 067-034-811-367-620; 067-508-790-495-042; 068-725-440-616-470; 069-433-596-880-560; 074-673-582-588-757; 079-186-794-748-250; 079-983-118-567-392; 080-563-843-899-028; 081-986-217-996-841; 082-644-667-674-977; 083-174-499-477-060; 084-799-292-394-467; 086-550-256-160-902; 088-221-686-800-039; 089-043-896-805-679; 089-130-310-469-555; 090-608-784-020-288; 094-065-241-429-80X; 094-573-329-693-323; 095-549-988-053-457; 097-732-051-560-271; 098-980-159-104-066; 100-361-246-135-255; 106-048-143-861-251; 116-790-084-500-26X; 119-113-819-818-430; 125-130-395-320-12X; 126-538-194-067-08X; 128-781-419-907-071; 132-870-760-929-441; 142-619-330-066-589; 147-311-910-110-057; 148-223-435-969-407; 162-315-235-973-255; 177-575-518-490-638; 184-127-711-354-368; 192-090-612-568-882,18

In what follows, I will focus on the second option and thus largely ignore the exegetical question to what extent Heath provides a fair reading of Habermas. This does not mean, however, that I will not make comparative judgements. On the contrary, my overall claim will be that Heath's new critical theory is more functionalist, and. partly as a result, less critical than Habermas's. Since lack of space does not permit me to argue this in accordance with the standards of detail that Heath's own book generally observes, my procedure may be justified by the attempt to provoke a clarificatory response from Heath.",44,2,351,362,Epistemology; Critical theory; Rational choice theory; Sociology; Ecological rationality; Communicative action; Rational agent; Functionalism (philosophy of mind); Causal decision theory; Rational expectations,,,,,http://www.journals.cambridge.org/abstract_S0012217300006247 https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/dialogue-canadian-philosophical-review-revue-canadienne-de-philosophie/article/new-critical-theory-based-on-rational-choice/0C8E1C2F5B6FC28B79A90F265682BC71,http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0012217300006247,,10.1017/s0012217300006247,1975441658,,0,011-111-548-927-823; 011-531-263-336-641; 016-463-915-711-25X; 016-592-126-692-261; 056-451-306-514-800; 060-639-709-250-570; 068-955-679-775-178; 074-622-857-431-071; 080-860-017-532-84X; 113-569-994-189-309; 113-813-475-985-700; 119-850-389-695-898; 126-083-308-174-724; 130-603-492-608-991; 147-950-881-413-278; 163-541-241-987-09X; 188-295-774-298-461,0

The framework is based on an in-depth review of 76 empirical studies published in high-quality academic journals in the areas of accounting, operations, and strategy. The framework classifies the consequences of CPM into three categories: people's behaviour, organizational capabilities, and performance consequences. This paper discusses our current knowledge on the impact of CPM, highlighting inconsistencies and gaps as well as providing direction for future research.",23,2,79,119,Empirical research; Performance indicator; Performance measurement; Conceptual framework; Balanced scorecard; Computer science; Management science,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044500512000169 https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/bitstream/1826/7498/1/Contemporary_performance_measurement_systems.pdf https://dspace.lib.cranfield.ac.uk/handle/1826/7498 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1044500512000169 https://www.infona.pl/resource/bwmeta1.element.elsevier-6dc701f5-cd9c-3151-82d7-09a6ed0e7c98 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/9637504.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.mar.2012.04.001,,10.1016/j.mar.2012.04.001,3123861895,,0,007-374-272-894-724; 010-892-777-302-016; 011-112-614-977-912; 012-788-949-940-835; 013-289-383-881-927; 013-825-526-048-112; 015-106-740-693-982; 015-340-164-709-012; 016-102-451-280-039; 018-032-978-687-734; 020-897-215-164-526; 022-988-926-932-858; 023-059-575-461-336; 024-921-052-560-606; 025-222-651-676-153; 026-007-820-914-111; 026-377-529-633-232; 026-447-745-411-395; 026-511-592-371-989; 027-531-343-779-89X; 027-847-281-426-669; 028-358-749-840-291; 031-672-019-523-79X; 031-930-683-845-921; 032-516-752-094-221; 034-946-441-599-436; 035-086-920-750-104; 035-113-628-602-658; 035-327-439-230-633; 035-348-029-823-965; 035-843-224-416-669; 036-044-261-609-684; 036-185-720-084-493; 036-765-270-227-960; 037-402-910-470-816; 037-540-330-414-557; 039-718-959-680-287; 039-817-283-589-558; 041-799-743-183-352; 042-263-748-785-572; 043-237-760-250-279; 043-401-594-995-014; 043-593-152-879-795; 043-879-846-070-716; 044-642-100-569-714; 045-564-140-651-742; 046-434-310-284-73X; 047-041-130-014-002; 047-504-378-155-720; 047-512-650-562-393; 047-631-509-012-976; 051-069-876-508-622; 051-400-421-598-008; 053-362-623-409-285; 053-378-980-436-712; 055-122-756-950-083; 055-807-088-113-125; 056-754-701-104-236; 058-307-964-290-42X; 059-699-647-518-007; 059-946-947-278-143; 063-101-626-489-265; 063-632-778-626-33X; 063-758-537-978-83X; 063-884-128-799-395; 064-882-263-409-561; 065-711-418-552-371; 067-786-300-318-167; 070-193-889-878-304; 070-632-999-105-750; 071-738-220-832-914; 072-137-822-524-372; 072-779-164-090-553; 073-632-144-957-842; 074-446-735-521-343; 075-134-367-281-65X; 077-246-747-012-805; 077-752-240-158-41X; 079-407-290-883-797; 079-496-270-039-377; 081-529-840-037-972; 081-606-120-674-320; 083-775-328-324-362; 084-002-164-524-502; 085-074-300-529-770; 086-993-701-614-697; 087-127-364-580-849; 088-110-042-660-569; 089-046-443-883-31X; 089-091-324-875-969; 089-621-912-811-772; 091-053-354-822-248; 091-636-182-627-693; 091-807-190-695-526; 094-486-975-626-947; 095-170-318-757-184; 095-957-334-060-116; 096-200-851-830-520; 100-193-611-222-956; 101-872-083-790-888; 102-168-318-168-047; 103-618-801-089-674; 103-806-276-045-101; 104-818-410-245-652; 107-401-050-235-033; 107-622-336-385-335; 108-945-451-205-929; 109-982-040-671-094; 112-631-921-152-589; 113-185-442-425-905; 113-597-500-929-994; 117-115-940-340-13X; 117-507-454-447-292; 119-327-449-954-614; 125-608-448-628-17X; 126-969-394-173-498; 129-902-510-401-439; 133-615-216-407-672; 136-542-005-301-995; 136-822-307-552-104; 137-044-796-664-032; 138-137-688-402-464; 142-682-060-816-168; 144-092-352-074-090; 144-308-133-226-525; 146-167-634-889-710; 146-270-281-787-465; 148-197-205-275-286; 149-488-192-578-419; 149-736-663-059-026; 150-241-486-237-67X; 151-355-796-707-747; 151-539-420-210-915; 151-932-962-595-574; 153-513-344-454-834; 153-785-137-332-841; 158-410-514-616-817; 161-827-456-637-952; 170-491-136-739-781; 175-817-209-182-064; 176-241-134-682-896; 179-608-372-698-452; 180-581-963-499-488; 181-776-963-214-581; 184-128-128-711-000; 186-924-451-684-428; 187-793-942-887-763; 198-154-648-754-191,316
042-074-008-934-592,The influence of prior experience and expected timing on vibrotactile discrimination,2013-12-24,2013,journal article,Frontiers in neuroscience,16624548; 1662453x,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Muhsin Karim; Justin A. Harris; Angela J. Langdon; Michael Breakspear,"Vibrotactile discrimination tasks involve perceptual judgements on stimulus pairs separated by a brief interstimulus interval (ISI). Despite their apparent simplicity, decision making during these tasks is biased by prior experience in a manner that is not well understood. A striking example is when participants perform well on trials where the first stimulus is closer to the mean of the stimulus-set than the second stimulus, and perform comparatively poorly when the first stimulus is further from the stimulus mean. This “time-order effect” suggests that participants implicitly encode the mean of the stimulus-set and use this internal standard to bias decisions on any given trial. For relatively short ISIs, the magnitude of the time-order effect typically increases with the distance of the first stimulus from the global mean. Working from the premise that the time-order effect reflects the loss of precision in working memory representations, we predicted that the influence of the time-order effect, and this superimposed “distance” effect, would monotonically increase for trials with longer ISIs. However, by varying the ISI across four intervals (300, 600, 1200 and 2400 ms) we instead found a complex, nonlinear dependence of the time-order effect on both the ISI and the distance, with the time-order effect being paradoxically stronger at short ISIs. We also found that this relationship depended strongly on participants’ prior experience of the ISI (from previous task titration). The time-order effect not only depends on participants’ expectations concerning the distribution of stimuli, but also on the expected timing of the trials.",7,,255,255,Interstimulus interval; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Working memory; Perception; Audiology; Stimulus control; Social psychology,bias; decision making; perceptual; prior; timing; vibrotactile,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3871714/ https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Angela_Langdon/publication/259628316_The_influence_of_prior_experience_and_expected_timing_on_vibrotactile_discrimination/links/53dc263f0cf2cfac9928ff5e.pdf https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/full https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255/pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3871714 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82856236.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fnins.2013.00255,24399927,10.3389/fnins.2013.00255,2126971738,PMC3871714,0,002-370-488-736-338; 004-990-129-191-647; 006-635-585-195-621; 006-776-808-910-215; 007-562-693-801-934; 009-273-174-068-947; 010-629-061-233-301; 012-987-257-553-318; 013-950-329-613-867; 015-850-737-875-422; 018-718-773-241-68X; 034-153-945-632-383; 041-663-521-893-233; 042-025-354-823-915; 042-773-220-708-405; 064-326-295-715-03X; 067-537-282-350-480; 090-264-277-472-582; 093-277-584-107-050; 107-022-923-209-783; 111-807-149-235-791; 123-323-955-812-48X; 127-930-296-287-932; 159-194-489-256-073,6

Results indicated that, contrary to what would be predicted by statistical averaging, the precision of mean size perception decreases with the number of judged elements. Since mean size discrimination was insensitive to how total size differences were distributed among individual elements, this suggests that the observer has a limited cognitive access to the size of individual elements pooled together in a compulsory manner before size information reaches awareness. Confirming the associative law of addition means, observers are indeed sensitive to the mean, not the sizes of individual elements. All existing data can be explained by an almost general theory, namely, the Noise and Selection (N&S) Theory, formulated in exact quantitative terms, implementing two familiar psychophysical principles: the size of an element cannot be measured with absolute accuracy and only a limited number of elements can be taken into account in the computation of the average size. It was concluded that the computation of ensemble characteristics is not necessarily a tool for surpassing the capacity limitations of perceptual processing.",83,,25,39,Statistics; Sensory threshold; Associative property; Cognition; Perception; Size Perception; General theory; Mathematics; Computation; Observer (quantum physics),,"Discrimination, Psychological/physiology; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Models, Theoretical; Photic Stimulation/methods; Psychometrics; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Size Perception/physiology",,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81112203 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552#! http://psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik-Toom-etal-General-Theory_VR2013.pdf http://sys130.psych.ut.ee/~jyri/en/Allik-Toom-etal-General-Theory_VR2013.pdf http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23499976 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698913000552 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81112203.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.visres.2013.02.018,23499976,10.1016/j.visres.2013.02.018,2039528732,,0,000-377-083-577-34X; 000-767-743-811-415; 001-529-878-461-937; 003-103-431-474-664; 003-117-529-078-237; 004-297-191-539-32X; 004-449-360-245-032; 005-589-187-502-728; 006-518-470-945-856; 006-791-051-768-178; 008-243-135-843-679; 008-531-871-132-038; 011-473-019-333-825; 013-064-393-085-978; 016-742-417-043-764; 018-051-287-827-615; 020-807-167-419-368; 024-306-285-412-917; 024-595-422-424-118; 024-673-786-111-666; 024-919-538-411-376; 025-351-543-577-386; 025-403-737-617-229; 028-183-827-153-760; 031-495-429-097-178; 031-547-776-718-970; 031-685-126-827-222; 032-278-554-207-722; 032-323-072-565-762; 032-471-285-806-958; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-198-059-523-21X; 040-935-145-873-641; 040-995-551-856-059; 041-142-702-847-240; 043-206-619-608-508; 044-576-839-282-073; 046-094-244-181-645; 050-390-666-490-991; 051-350-468-536-063; 051-472-129-782-759; 055-807-088-113-125; 057-472-267-307-954; 059-975-734-862-12X; 059-984-158-464-717; 062-715-707-819-617; 063-350-353-646-858; 065-308-219-393-478; 067-130-107-656-138; 067-566-373-687-778; 067-631-252-449-755; 069-372-379-869-609; 076-483-968-109-005; 078-474-590-257-88X; 078-479-099-650-852; 081-155-610-461-715; 083-405-990-852-057; 084-295-432-154-870; 086-289-201-316-010; 086-949-607-297-834; 086-993-701-614-697; 088-559-042-456-736; 097-548-842-291-32X; 097-641-560-543-097; 098-950-277-295-601; 109-402-746-487-551; 121-161-560-636-803; 129-827-356-327-594; 143-356-867-650-624; 166-150-163-298-176; 173-486-040-154-60X; 182-300-831-265-929; 182-999-071-211-101; 187-775-804-492-449; 195-044-985-743-85X,46

The series were learned and tested in a control condition (without interference), concurrently with articulatory suppression, and concurrently with hand movement (tapping). In addition, task difficulty was varied. There was a clear increase in error rates under articulatory suppression with pictures as well as with words as stimuli.

045-322-807-082-276,Color Imaging Conference - Image Quality Measures for Evaluating Gamut Mapping.,,2009,conference proceedings,,,,,Zofia Baranczuk; Peter Zolliker; Joachim Giesen,"In this paper we compare different image quality measures for the gamut mapping problem, and validate them using psychovisual data from four recent gamut mapping studies. The psychovisual data are choice data of the form: given an original image and two images obtained by applying different gamut mapping algorithms, an observer chooses the one that reproduces the original image better in his/her opinion. The scoring function used to validate the quality measures is the hit rate, i.e., the percentage of correct choice predictions on data from the psycho-visual tests. We also propose a new image quality measure based on the difference in color and local contrast. This measure compares well to the measures from the literature on our psycho-visual data. Some of these measures predict the observer’s preferences equally well as scaling methods like Thurstone’s method or conjoint analysis that are used to evaluate the psycho-visual tests. This is remarkable in the sense that the scaling methods are based on the experimental data, whereas the quality measures are independent of this data. Introduction Gamut mapping describes how a color image is rendered on a device with limited color reproduction capabilities. This classical problem is still an area of active research – Morovic gives a good recent overview [1]. An important step in improving gamut mapping algorithm is an accurate evaluation of its psycho-visual performance. This is traditionally achieved using psycho-visual tests, where observers have to decide which of the mapped images are the better representation of the original. The data gathered in such a test are typically evaluated using Thurstone’s Law of Comparative Judgement [2]. An alternative approach that we want to evaluate here is to use an image quality measure (independent of observer feedback) to measure the difference of a mapped image to the original. An overview of the state of the art in image quality research can be found for example in [3] or [4]. Image quality measures are successfully used in many imaging applications, such as modeling image distortions, especially in data compression [5]. The advantage of using “good” image quality measures to evaluate gamut mapping algorithms is that they can be used to automatically predict the perceived quality of a mapped image without the need for a new psycho-visual study. Psychovisual tests generally give reliable results for tested settings but the tests are time consuming. Furthermore, an extrapolation to changed settings and new images is problematic. Computing an image quality measure on the other hand provides results immediately. The challenge is to find a measure that correlates well with observers’ preferences. It has to represent the response of the human visual system as a mathematical function. For gamut mapping the main image quality factors are preservation of lightness/color and preservation of spatial details. Artifacts introduced by the mapping algorithms may also be a factor which, however, will be neglected in the present study. Some factors encountered in other image quality applications such as noise or compression artifacts are of minor importance for gamut mapping. The main topic of this paper is a quantitative comparison of the performance of image quality measures with data driven quality measures from psycho-visual tests. The performance of the measures is assessed as the percentage of correctly predicted observer choices on data from a psycho-visual test. The data used to compute these percentages were neither used for data evaluation nor for the optimization of the corresponding measures (compare Section ”Validating the quality measures”). Correlations of psycho-visual gamut mapping evaluation and image quality measures have been published before in [6], where only a general ranking of gamut mapping algorithms has been discussed. Our focus here is on predicting observers’ choices in individual comparisons between mapped images. The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: In the next two sections we describe the image quality measures considered in this paper. Then Thurstone’s method and an extension to conjoint analysis are briefly described as methods for evaluating psycho-visual test data. In the subsequent section we describe how to validate the different image quality measures for gamut mapping. The data sets which we used for validation are described in a section on its own. Finally, we discuss the experimental validation results on data sets and conclude the paper. Image quality measures In this section we review the image quality measures that we have compared. We always compare two images X and Y with n×m pixels. At the pixels xi j ∈ X and yi j ∈ Y , respectively, we consider color coordinates. Mostly we are using the lightness coordinate L in CIELAB color space. If not stated otherwise we do not distinguish in our notation between a pixel and the color coordinate considered at this pixel. Structural Similarity Index (SSIM) The Structural Similarity Index was introduced by Wang et. al. [7] and is defined on quadratic image patches of size k× k at the same location within image X and Y . We computed SSIM for the L coordinate in CIELAB color space. Let PX ⊂ X be such a patch and PY the corresponding patch for Y . We compute the following quantities for the patches: PX = 1 k2 ∑ x∈PX x, PY = 1 k2 ∑ y∈PY y, 17th Color Imaging Conference Final Program and Proceedings 21 Figure 1: The original image (on the left) and two gamut mapped images (in the middle and on the right). For the image in middle we have QΔE = 24.65 and QΔLC = 0.341 using HPminDE without detail enhancement, and on the right we have QΔE = 27.00 and QΔLC = 0.318 using HPminDE with details enhancement. Note for the image in the middle QΔE is smaller than for the image on the right, but the middle image has lost a lot of details and has the larger perceptual distance from the original (left image). σPX 2 = 1 k2 −1 ∑ x∈PX (x− PX ) , σPY 2 = 1 k2 −1 ∑ y∈PY (y− PY ) , and σPX PY = 1 k2 −1 k2 ∑ i=1 (xi − PX )(yi − PY ) The Structural Similarity Index is then defined as SSIM(PX ,PY ) = (2PX PY +c1) (2σPX PY +c2) ( P2 X + P 2 Y +c1 )( σ2 PX +σ 2 PY +c2 ) , with two constants c1 and c2. As proposed by Wang et. al. [5] we used c1 = 1 and c2 = 9 for these constants and k = 8 for the patch size. From the Structural Similarity Index the image quality measure QSSIM(X ,Y ) can be defined as the Structural Similarity Index SSIM averaged over all possible k× k patches in the images X and Y . The resulting measure is in the range [−1,1], and the higher the QSSIM value, the more similar are the compared images. Laplacian mean square error (LMSE) Like the Structural Similarity Index the Laplacian Mean Square Error (compare [8]) is a local measure for the difference in two images. We compute the following quantities at each pixel (more exactly at L coordinate in CIELAB color space of each pixel, with indices 2 ≤ i ≤ n−1 and 2 ≤ j ≤ m−1) of X and Y , respectively: L(xi j) = x(i+1) j +x(i−1) j +xi( j+1) +xi( j−1)−4xi j and L(yi j) = y(i+1) j +y(i−1) j +yi( j+1) +yi( j−1)−4yi j The image quality measure QLMSE is then defined as QLMSE(X ,Y ) = 1 (n−2)(m−2) n−1 ∑ i=2 m−1 ∑ j=2 ( L(xi j)−L(yi j) )2 . Mean square error (MSE) We also consider the mean square error which is just the squared pointwise difference between the images X and Y . The corresponding image quality measure QMSE is defined as QMSE(X ,Y ) = 1 nm n ∑ i=1 m ∑ j=1 (xi j −yi j), where xi j and yi j are L coordinates in the CIELAB color space for the points in images X and Y respectively. Discrete wavelet transform (DWT) The discrete wavelet transform image quality measure has been defined in [9]. Images X and Y are compared as follows: a discrete wavelet transform is applied to the luminance layer of image X and Y , respectively. Let M f X be the magnitudes of the discrete wavelet transform coefficients obtained for X and frequency band f , and let M f Y be the corresponding magnitudes for image Y . From M f X and M f Y the absolute values of differences d f i (X ,Y ) = ∣∣M f X i −M f Y i ∣∣ , i = 1, . . . , ∣∣M f X ∣∣= ∣∣M f Y ∣∣ . are computed for each frequency band. Let σf (X ,Y ) be the standard deviation of the differences d f i (X ,Y ) for frequency band f . Now, the QDWT(X ,Y ) image quality measure is defined as the mean of the σ f (X ,Y ) for all the frequency bands. In our implementation we use Daubechies’ filter [10] to compute the discrete wavelet transform image quality measure QDWT. 22 ©2009 Society for Imaging Science and Technology A new quality measure The quality measure that we are going to describe in this section is based on the observation that important factors determining the quality of gamut mapping algorithms are color preservation and contrast (detail) preservation. We estimate the degree of color preservation by using the CIELAB ΔE distance measure [11]. The example in Figure 1 demonstrates that QΔE , i.e., the quality measure derived from ΔE, alone is not an accurate quality measure since it neglects the preservation of details. To account also for detail preservation we introduce a contrast preserving measure that we call QΔLC . Our quality measure is then a linear combination of QΔE and QΔLC . Below we describe the two measures QΔE and QΔLC in more detail. The measure QΔE ΔE is defined as the Euclidean distance in CIELAB color space between corresponding pixels in two images X and Y of size n×m. That is, locally at pixel x ∈ X and the corresponding pixel y ∈Y the ΔE distance is defined as: ΔE(x,y) = √ ((Lx −Ly)2 +(ax −ay)2 +(bx −by)2) As our image quality measure QΔE we take the average ΔE over the pixels of the two images, i.e.,",,,21,26,Discrete mathematics; Square (algebra); Color image; Pixel; Gamut; Color space; Mathematics; Image quality; Function (mathematics); Linear combination,,,,,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imaging/cic2009.html#BaranczukZG09 http://www.imaging.org/site/PDFS/Reporter/Articles/REP25_1_CIC17_BARANCZUK_PG21.pdf,https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/imaging/cic2009.html#BaranczukZG09,,,2403618208,,0,011-929-709-273-105; 012-267-637-411-009; 012-607-424-849-021; 016-349-641-603-550; 024-552-039-065-36X; 033-624-410-466-325; 034-067-552-921-802; 042-989-858-001-380; 046-531-946-022-828; 049-373-296-471-637; 057-907-564-621-130; 079-995-145-469-497; 108-002-099-886-601; 116-237-865-563-980; 119-338-111-500-600; 136-131-588-534-187; 137-000-353-619-967; 163-590-981-274-352; 166-585-827-428-918,13

The task becomes more complicated when the testing of tone-mapped images is desired as it is not possible to directly display HDR content on standard displays, hence unavailability of reference images for comparison. This limits the quality evaluation methods to comparative or categorical judgement. For this study, we used the comparative judgement method to subjectively test the performance of images tone-mapped by different operators against each other on eight different visual image appearance attributes. Attributes having a higher correlation with overall image preference scores are used to develop the proposed no-reference image quality metric. Results of the psychophysical experiment and performance of the resulting metric are reported here.",,,3,10,Correlation; Artificial intelligence; Pattern recognition; Judgement; Unavailability; Evaluation methods; No reference; Computer science; Categorical variable; Image quality; Operator (computer programming),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-981-15-1864-5_1,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-981-15-1864-5_1,,10.1007/978-981-15-1864-5_1,3016151786,,0,009-735-379-663-284; 011-091-521-090-992; 022-542-466-760-242; 029-971-091-253-42X; 031-499-365-673-874; 044-095-303-626-459; 051-076-915-124-660; 054-843-492-991-175; 060-834-533-443-304; 065-434-177-193-511; 068-835-728-229-08X; 078-078-628-210-194; 082-593-459-358-921; 106-261-649-162-207; 108-233-746-902-697; 119-338-111-500-600; 151-567-741-961-697; 188-080-284-826-219; 189-619-439-009-460,0

Preferensi wisatawan merupakan gambaran-gambaran dari nilai-nilai terbaik yang dipertimbangkan wisatawan dalam menentukan sebuah pilihan berwisata. Preferensi wisatawan dianggap sebagai pandangan ideal atas keberadaan wisata dilihat dari prespektif dan tuntutan wisatawan. Studi ini bertujuan untuk melakukan perbandingan dua tempat wisata budaya kampung adat dari sisi preferensi wisatawan dengan menggunakan analisa the law of comparative judgement. Responden terdiri dari wisatawan domestik termasuk wisatawan lokal dan wisatawan mancanegara. Berdasarkan hasil komparasi dari berbagai teori, maka faktor-faktor yang menjadi hipotesa untuk diteliti dalam studi ini adalah gambaran perjalanan wisata (jarak objek wisata, lama tinggal, biaya, resiko, dan tingkat kepercayaan terhadap biro perjalanan); keunggulan daerah tujuan wisata (jenis atraksi, kualitas layanan, lingkungan fisik, dan sikap masyarakat lokal); akomodasi wisata (keberadaan fasilitas wisata, jumlah, dan kisaran harga); serta aksesibilitas (jarak objek wisata, kondisi jalan, jenis angkutan, frekuensi, dan tarif angkutan). Terdapat tiga tahapan analisa dalam studi ini yaitu: pertama, deskriptif kualitatif; kedua, analisa the law of comparative judgement; dan ketiga, analisa lokasi wisata budaya kampung adat yang paling disukai berdasarkan preferensi wisatawan dengan menggunakan metode pembobotan.Hasil analisa menyimpulkan bahwa: metode the law of comparative judgement dapat digunakan dalam studi yang bersifat perbandingan, dengan responden utamanya yaitu wisatawan; karakter yang berbeda antara wisatawan domestik dan wisatawan mancanegara menyebabkan adanya perbedaan pada penilaian kepentingan relatif preferensi setiap wisatawan; berdasarkan preferensi wisatawan, wisatawan domestik dan wisatawan mancanegara lebih memilih Kampung Adat Bena sebagai lokasi wisata budaya kampung adat yang lebih disukai; serta terdapat dua faktor pembeda yang membedakan Kampung Adat Bena dan Kampung Adat Wogo, dimana terdiri dari daya tarik wisata (tourist heritage) yaitu ornamen rumah adat (Sa’o) dan kebudayaan tradisional (bahasa, mata pencaharian dan kerajinan tradisional), serta akomodasi wisata.

Subjects had to study four-term orderings and were tested by a comparative judgement task. The stimuli were either verbal or pictorial. Under both modalities the correlation of spatial and size information was manipulated. Error rates were considered the dependent variable. A clear picture superiority effect was obtained. For verbal material end-term effects and distance effects were found. For pictorial stimuli a flat function for error rates over testpairs was observed, when spatial and size information were perfectly correlated. With incongruent size and spatial information the error pattern approached that for verbal material. The findings support the assumption that pictorial stimuli provide different or additional memory codes that can influence memory under appropriate conditions.

Professional judgement by teachers replaces the marking of tests; a judge is asked to compare the work of two students and simply to decide which of them is the better. From many such comparisons a measurement scale is created showing the relative quality of students’ work; this can then be referenced in familiar ways to generate test results. The judges are asked only to make a valid decision about quality, yet ACJ achieves extremely high levels of reliability, often considerably higher than practicable operational marking can achieve. It therefore offers a radical alternative to the pursuit of reliability through detailed marking schemes. ACJ is clearly appropriate for performances like writing or art, and for complex portfolios or reports, but may be useful in other contexts too.

We tested an alternative approach in which students judged pairs of scripts against one another in the absence of assessment criteria. First year mathematics undergraduates (N = 194) sat a written test on conceptual understanding of multivariable calculus, then assessed their peers' responses using pairwise comparative judgement. Inter-rater reliability was investigated by randomly assigning the students to two groups and correlating the two groups' assessments.

This addresses the current concern in developed economies about providing information in order to reconnect consumers with food producers and to support moves towards more local, fairly traded and sustainable production. However, we show that such a ‘knowledge fix’ approach of providing information may not reconnect consumers so easily. Participants found it particularly difficult to work out what certification involved and what kinds of organisations were providing assurance. They built vernacular typologies and comparative judgements that did not necessarily identify or prioritise ‘independent’ third-party certification as the gold standard, not least because of the practical difficulties of monitoring complex supply chains, and expressed confusion and scepticism about how well food assurance schemes could work in practice. Our results therefore problematise the knowledge fix urged in the literature and emphasise instead the need to better understand how consumers make sense of assurance information in different contexts.",24,1,1,14,Supply chain; Agricultural productivity; Economics; Marketing; Consumer economics; Consumer education; Credibility; Public relations; Certification; Program evaluation; Consumer confidence index,,,,,http://cadair.aber.ac.uk/dspace/handle/2160/2903 http://orca-mwe.cf.ac.uk/37203/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016707000472 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/37203/ https://eprints.lancs.ac.uk/id/eprint/30767/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0743016707000472%20abstract https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ780445 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/1917726.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.06.001,,10.1016/j.jrurstud.2007.06.001,2040982639,,0,000-595-849-074-515; 000-748-623-473-681; 002-063-238-335-689; 002-753-867-294-46X; 004-750-616-859-955; 004-966-115-683-261; 005-795-466-388-400; 008-580-519-050-659; 010-812-944-002-692; 012-458-125-588-240; 012-675-989-505-589; 015-071-842-834-355; 016-788-351-631-136; 019-981-283-730-805; 020-026-570-283-294; 024-036-695-451-591; 025-217-878-102-30X; 028-266-474-295-598; 031-224-190-028-650; 031-276-737-336-935; 031-753-581-887-448; 033-571-421-930-764; 035-008-859-727-939; 035-413-262-979-454; 036-203-912-180-419; 045-716-439-451-462; 049-542-552-344-27X; 058-007-242-844-895; 061-674-043-873-957; 064-014-358-244-923; 083-567-878-608-021; 091-126-272-146-99X; 092-566-902-732-519; 093-192-097-672-906; 097-289-028-577-792; 120-791-681-916-465; 124-784-333-463-949; 127-202-139-315-762; 132-768-221-475-021; 146-118-675-663-311; 148-790-948-738-664; 153-527-450-427-925; 178-687-005-951-817,95

In the sports without body touching, in which body attack is not done in an international manner, they are almost settled by comparative judgement. On the other hand, in the sports with body touching, which focus on injury or somewhat have risk of injury, it will be possible that we show not only the case of violating rule by serious accident but also the case of international action.

They can serve as the basis for a comparative judgement of a material's mechanical behaviour. Furthermore, knowledge of the stress-strain behaviour during cyclic loading is required more and more frequently in finite element calculations of cyclically loaded structural parts. Finally, such data are a fundamental input for the fatigue life estimation procedure known as the Local Strain Approach or Notch Strain Approach. Materials data for cyclic loading have been published in the scientific literature for many years, but have been collected in quite different ways. This is the first time that such data have been gathered together, evaluated according to uniform approach and methods, and compiled on standardised data sheets. The handbook comprises five volumes containing a collection of some 600 datasets with over 4000 experimental results in total.",,,,,Alloy; Scientific literature; Finite element calculations; Cyclic loading; Engineering design process; Computer science; Structural engineering,,,,,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA01529310,http://ci.nii.ac.jp/ncid/BA01529310,,,2801880525,,0,,0

We also sought to identify how they prioritize between these use and non-use values. Use values are derived from productivity considerations; non-use values are derived from the wellbeing of the animals, independent of the present or future use the farmer may make of the animal. In particular, we examined the empirical content and structure of the economic value dairy farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows. Based on a best-worst scaling approach and data from 123 Swedish dairy farmers, we suggest that the economic value those farmers associate with animal welfare of dairy cows covers aspects of both use and non-use type, with non-use values appearing more important. Using principal component factor analysis, we were able to check unidimensionality of the economic value construct. These findings are useful for understanding why dairy farmers may be interested in considering dairy cow welfare. Such understanding is essential for improving agricultural policy and advice aimed at encouraging dairy farmers to improve animal welfare; communicating to consumers the values under which dairy products are produced; and providing a basis for more realistic assumptions when developing economic models about dairy farmers' behavior.",99,1,579,592,Welfare; Economic model; Economics; Best–worst scaling; Non-use value; Agricultural policy; Principal component factor analysis; Agricultural science; Agricultural economics; Animal welfare; Animal husbandry,animal welfare of dairy cow; best-worst scaling; economic value in animal welfare; non-use value; use value,"Animal Husbandry; Animal Welfare/economics; Animals; Attitude; Cattle/physiology; Dairying/economics; Farmers/psychology; Female; Models, Economic; Motivation; Principal Component Analysis",,Svenska Forskningsrådet Formas,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26547638 https://core.ac.uk/display/82430178 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215007882 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26547638 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022030215007882 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82430178.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3168/jds.2015-9755,26547638,10.3168/jds.2015-9755,2195579028,,0,005-061-294-522-817; 005-844-689-987-193; 009-299-623-546-736; 014-300-074-989-740; 014-617-441-512-393; 021-937-199-568-87X; 022-297-308-392-10X; 023-121-228-228-497; 023-516-882-343-752; 023-957-645-099-200; 024-677-580-110-025; 035-776-610-863-582; 042-844-853-562-456; 048-800-722-633-000; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-790-319-210-848; 071-679-165-049-689; 072-611-672-056-002; 077-424-508-300-382; 092-594-821-493-18X; 095-153-189-825-288; 097-031-100-929-863; 098-277-196-857-548; 098-538-505-624-178; 099-167-496-298-409; 102-372-296-507-391; 115-365-719-484-555; 120-483-665-522-971; 120-902-493-548-959; 122-593-052-625-863; 127-629-056-629-021; 135-382-726-691-472; 152-039-150-446-770; 153-239-246-506-62X; 162-854-711-868-871; 164-260-106-908-120; 171-236-934-325-469; 173-935-981-761-429,23

Viewers might conflate the size of a word's font with a word's length, the number of letters it contains, or with the larger or smaller heights of particular characters (‘o’ versus ‘p’ versus ‘b’).

In two studies, a total of 72 5-year olds were shown a route in a six turn maze in a virtual environment and were then asked to retrace this route by themselves. A unique landmark was positioned at each junction and each junction was made up of two paths: a correct path and an incorrect path. Two different strategies improved route learning performance. In Experiment 1, verbally labeling on-route junction landmarks during the first walk reduced the number of errors and the number of trials to reach a learning criterion when the children retraced the route. In Experiment 2, encouraging children to attend to on-route junction landmarks on the first walk reduced the number of errors when the route was retraced. This was the first study to show that very young children can be taught route learning skills. The implications of our results are discussed.",6,,174,174,Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Virtual machine; Landmark,landmarks; navigational strategies; route learning; virtual environments; wayfinding,,,,https://livrepository.liverpool.ac.uk/2013042/ http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00174/abstract https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4357248 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00174/pdf https://philpapers.org/rec/LINEYO https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00174/full http://eprints.whiterose.ac.uk/86003/ https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/1473136/ http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/850210/ https://core.ac.uk/display/43821577 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4357248 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/80772985.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00174,25814960,10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00174,1987888399,PMC4357248,0,000-342-189-964-25X; 001-970-248-386-642; 002-629-160-942-429; 008-714-895-674-773; 013-339-264-243-060; 018-580-847-885-957; 023-588-700-985-547; 025-369-412-374-760; 026-024-849-704-550; 029-211-703-128-186; 031-037-478-086-100; 036-673-453-551-714; 037-715-711-815-268; 038-623-402-517-855; 039-492-344-480-212; 043-961-866-946-597; 044-607-366-863-634; 046-131-243-488-119; 046-761-400-211-305; 046-848-636-916-776; 049-928-293-562-396; 052-171-111-783-38X; 055-481-145-387-599; 057-065-998-992-600; 064-734-008-903-509; 065-698-408-265-439; 066-996-638-388-276; 067-394-122-738-683; 067-645-283-065-049; 073-280-862-587-771; 074-203-293-291-774; 075-903-814-812-971; 078-367-000-959-803; 078-403-323-297-053; 080-411-094-886-613; 083-586-054-770-281; 084-568-701-719-501; 088-496-297-095-48X; 089-955-430-654-591; 090-995-970-234-071; 100-598-008-396-543; 108-121-304-613-111; 111-271-282-160-941; 145-599-989-040-794; 165-316-328-209-540; 165-799-926-133-16X; 179-302-779-534-167,8

But there is no extant account of what typically makes typical legal systems coercive when they are coercive. This paper presents such an account and compares it with four alternative views. Towards the end I discuss the proposed account’s payoffs. Among other things, I show how it can help us explain what I call ‘comparative judgements’ about coercive legal systems (judgements such as ‘Legal system a is more coercive than legal system b’) and how it can help the development of social scientific inquiries into the coerciveness of our legal systems.",,,,,Philosophy of law; Political science; Extant taxon; Civil law (legal system); Law; Sanctions; Politics,,,,,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/Delivery.cfm/SSRN_ID3648093_code2387127.pdf?abstractid=3648093&mirid=1 https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3648093,https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3648093,,,3079620224,,0,,0

Bridges,"Lunar and planetary exploration has required the development of new techniques of cartographic portrayal. Conventional photo-interpretive methods employing size, shape, shadow, tone, pattern, and texture are applied to computer-processed satellite television images. Comparative judgements are affected by illumination, resolution, variations in surface coloration, and transmission or processing artifacts. The portrayal of tonal densities in a relief illustration is performed using a unique airbrush technique derived from hill-shading of contour maps. The control of tone and line quality is essential because the mid-gray to dark tone densities must be finalized prior to the addition of highlights to the drawing. This is done with an electric eraser until the drawing is completed. The drawing density is controlled with a reflectance-reading densitometer to meet certain density guidelines. The versatility of planetary photo-interpretive methods for airbrushed map portrayals is demonstrated by the application of these techniques to the synthesis of nonrelief data.",42,,244,265,Photomapping; Artificial intelligence; Shadow; Geography; Planetary exploration; Satellite television; Image enhancement; Computer vision; Densitometer; Cartography; Contour line,,,,,https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/442505 https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=19760051207 http://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1976smfc.proc..244I/abstract,https://repository.exst.jaxa.jp/dspace/handle/a-is/442505,,,1600940629,,0,,2

Mühlbacher; Anika Kaczynski; Peter Zweifel,"Best-Worst Scaling (BWS) is a method of multi-attribute preference measurement. Its objective is to determine the preferences with respect to certain properties and characteristics. It is a stated preference method and based on the assumption that people are able to select the best and worst or subjectively most and least important from a set of three or more elements. BWS avoids, like all discrete choice experiments, the known weaknesses of rating and ranking scales. However, BWS promises to generate additional information because participants choose two times, namely the best as well as the worst alternative. This paper describes the potentials of application, the underlying theoretical concepts, and the implementation of the three variants of BWS experiments. It also shows that at least the second variant of BWS (the so-called profile case) is subject to restrictive and unrealistic assumptions.",11,2,101,117,Machine learning; Artificial intelligence; Ranking; Discrete choice experiment; Preference measurement; Computer science; Scaling,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40275-014-0012-7/fulltext.html https://rd.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40275-014-0012-7 https://paperity.org/p/36428147/experimentelle-praferenzmessung-im-gesundheitswesen-mit-hilfe-von-best-worst-scaling-bws https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007%2Fs40275-014-0012-7.pdf https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40275-014-0012-7 https://core.ac.uk/display/81053796 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81053796.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40275-014-0012-7,,10.1007/s40275-014-0012-7,2088583155,,0,000-749-390-969-022; 001-708-032-475-503; 002-043-095-215-242; 005-176-522-543-813; 009-899-013-372-299; 012-277-806-980-851; 013-516-126-364-950; 014-300-074-989-740; 014-632-759-895-377; 017-732-979-943-710; 018-243-374-081-942; 018-509-453-026-429; 019-389-216-620-099; 020-366-670-021-807; 021-109-454-451-000; 022-880-424-878-113; 024-464-727-137-603; 024-683-165-045-722; 025-272-663-523-790; 025-751-577-076-283; 025-927-180-807-187; 026-128-608-239-084; 030-541-900-761-412; 031-939-240-759-769; 032-068-754-182-712; 034-388-036-445-093; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-109-079-236-740; 037-016-575-023-713; 039-086-114-639-706; 039-615-174-805-615; 040-551-099-736-618; 041-067-188-972-243; 041-659-281-349-623; 044-662-206-591-723; 050-943-988-713-681; 053-989-203-088-066; 055-457-027-660-419; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-371-865-152-888; 060-527-350-964-182; 064-679-251-949-700; 065-248-374-172-454; 065-409-107-548-650; 067-738-899-236-742; 071-674-642-056-169; 073-651-724-549-224; 078-275-579-339-567; 085-138-376-626-614; 089-468-883-189-639; 092-474-419-202-077; 093-149-980-450-604; 094-358-676-541-701; 095-466-689-488-019; 095-803-666-080-728; 098-584-706-383-443; 102-372-296-507-391; 109-162-609-116-471; 109-791-194-998-370; 122-643-472-106-931; 123-275-195-954-683; 125-772-762-512-161; 128-272-310-888-967; 164-260-106-908-120; 164-348-906-218-079; 167-138-017-981-772; 179-629-903-917-048; 179-735-126-745-809; 180-628-368-670-354,3

In a pretest we established comparative self-positivity and a focus effect for environmental awareness. In the main study we aimed at shifting these effects by manipulating the accessibility of harmful behaviours of either the self or the typical student before obtaining comparative judgements. Specifically, we used two types of accessibility manipulations: anchoring and ease of retrieval. We predicted that judgements would be affected by content in the anchoring paradigm but by subjective ease in the ease of retrieval paradigm. We found the predicted pattern of effects, but it was strongest when participants focused on the typical student. The findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanisms underlying comparative biases and may have applied implications.

056-285-533-277-920,A process analysis of the CA3 subregion of the hippocampus.,2013-05-27,2013,journal article,Frontiers in cellular neuroscience,16625102,Frontiers Media S.A.,Switzerland,Raymond P. Kesner,"Abstract From a behavioral perspective the CA3a,b subregion of the hippocampus plays an important role in the encoding of new spatial information within short-term memory with a duration of seconds and minutes. This can easily be observed in tasks that require rapid encoding, novelty detection, 1-trial short- term or working memory, and 1-trial cued recall primarily for spatial information. These are tasks that have been assumed to reflect the operations of episodic memory and require interactions between CA3a,b and the dentate gyrus via mossy fiber inputs into the CA3a,b. The CA3a,b is also important for encoding of spatial information requiring the acquisition of arbitrary and relational associations. All these tasks are assumed to operate within an autoassociative network function of the CA3 region. The CA3a,b also supports retrieval of short-term memory information based on a spatial pattern completion process. Based on afferent inputs into CA3a,b from the dentate gyrus (DG) via mossy fibers and afferents from the entorhinal cortex into CA3a,b as well as reciprocal connections with the septum, CA3a,b can bias the process of encoding utilizing the operation of spatial pattern separation and the process of retrieval utilizing the operation of pattern completion. The CA3a,b also supports sequential processing of information in cooperation with CA1 based on the Schaffer collateral output from CA3a,b to CA1. The CA3c function is in part based on modulation of the DG in supporting pattern separation processes.",7,,78,78,Encoding (memory); Psychology; Neuroscience; Working memory; Dentate gyrus; Pattern completion; Schaffer collateral; Entorhinal cortex; Hippocampus; Episodic memory,CA3; associative processes; memory; pattern completion; rapid encoding,,,,http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3664330 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/23750126/ https://core.ac.uk/display/82867210 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Raymond_Kesner/publication/237085098_A_process_analysis_of_the_CA3_subregion_of_the_hippocampus/links/0a85e52f112760a282000000.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23750126 http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078/abstract https://doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078/full https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82867210.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fncel.2013.00078,23750126,10.3389/fncel.2013.00078,2038513471,PMC3664330,0,001-740-929-023-245; 001-983-738-406-864; 002-114-557-881-65X; 003-115-182-404-128; 003-250-016-250-356; 004-073-488-611-844; 005-230-777-005-480; 005-309-415-702-766; 006-064-194-133-371; 007-023-855-587-895; 007-472-920-746-615; 007-817-357-440-465; 007-933-480-913-713; 008-729-687-771-60X; 009-058-041-709-788; 009-666-718-705-711; 010-310-821-484-206; 010-365-859-345-074; 010-587-774-685-049; 010-595-782-667-086; 010-707-834-603-425; 011-757-607-570-549; 011-930-492-364-513; 012-454-288-338-336; 012-584-536-339-836; 013-084-967-051-661; 013-792-248-941-446; 013-866-390-076-210; 014-244-315-155-744; 014-689-286-651-344; 014-891-989-023-060; 014-926-103-220-127; 015-582-942-418-564; 015-789-369-936-446; 016-298-055-488-302; 017-337-210-834-726; 019-303-201-415-105; 020-509-349-353-739; 020-604-192-575-485; 021-076-341-831-033; 021-594-847-608-154; 022-822-585-426-737; 023-255-081-688-141; 023-533-660-411-611; 024-099-414-817-875; 024-443-971-670-503; 024-955-502-398-665; 026-154-484-191-523; 026-300-907-908-331; 027-627-856-292-290; 029-905-583-852-714; 030-802-317-699-538; 032-252-535-762-493; 033-319-248-110-441; 033-859-292-256-154; 034-707-884-972-06X; 035-685-850-112-397; 036-464-127-683-059; 037-136-972-184-672; 037-743-643-744-047; 038-055-102-680-770; 038-365-458-685-015; 040-317-869-942-536; 040-585-680-645-299; 041-331-820-504-161; 041-712-329-795-252; 043-149-623-846-383; 043-205-473-155-408; 043-911-303-121-764; 044-144-034-480-17X; 044-971-255-581-07X; 045-908-960-331-492; 046-783-708-771-349; 047-269-542-598-826; 048-209-268-809-10X; 048-631-295-740-180; 049-021-957-361-605; 049-143-609-387-994; 049-860-583-948-600; 050-171-503-757-081; 050-412-286-857-303; 050-695-353-577-209; 050-806-728-076-97X; 051-055-041-266-664; 051-723-328-133-819; 053-514-210-395-68X; 053-873-194-151-435; 054-545-096-555-616; 055-300-967-753-409; 057-904-745-736-523; 057-908-306-275-372; 058-260-141-137-138; 060-452-277-749-254; 063-875-013-866-645; 065-836-585-364-553; 067-978-518-590-987; 069-057-230-254-163; 070-455-679-501-91X; 072-508-846-029-982; 072-904-248-565-616; 073-409-106-297-204; 073-801-131-427-775; 078-363-217-288-440; 081-103-690-318-761; 081-487-577-006-024; 082-297-965-078-918; 083-354-491-680-679; 085-416-937-134-407; 085-778-568-332-851; 087-420-968-186-052; 087-724-639-391-613; 088-077-123-563-275; 088-600-892-119-367; 092-839-488-315-277; 095-509-266-443-043; 097-153-938-928-181; 098-442-822-028-015; 100-829-335-987-944; 102-235-883-696-042; 104-456-638-171-818; 105-604-383-955-722; 106-792-977-107-752; 111-556-285-672-351; 113-663-502-010-618; 115-700-169-686-085; 116-966-512-495-943; 117-478-672-448-509; 122-602-169-555-370; 126-517-380-881-98X; 133-699-427-949-309; 136-377-746-210-402; 140-919-725-143-632; 141-928-094-235-995; 143-559-414-459-00X; 145-585-225-851-338; 148-065-468-888-987; 152-534-030-049-656; 157-232-557-465-355; 160-149-651-959-459; 161-471-192-209-270; 162-045-520-108-853; 175-999-757-221-722; 176-017-510-665-867; 179-233-802-025-971,55

Ellis; Nigel D Haig,"The effect of feature displacement within two well-known faces (Terry Wogan and Cyril Smith) was examined. Image processing equipment was used to produce stimuli in which the features of an original facial image were displaced to form a number of modified images. This technique was first reported by Haig, in a recognition study in which the effect of feature displacement within unfamiliar faces was investigated. In the present experiment a perceptual judgement task was carried out in which subjects were presented with a number of modified faces and asked to judge how dissimilar these were with respect to an original image. A multidimensional scaling analysis of the comparative judgements of the subjects revealed a two-dimensional solution involving displacement of the eyes and mouth. A clear division between up/down and inward/outward displacement within these features (particularly the eyes) was observed. A similar pattern of results was found for both well-known faces.

056-820-222-683-595,Should IQWiG revise its methods of cost-effectiveness analysis in order to comply with more widely accepted health economical evaluation standards?,2010-03-16,2010,journal article,Deutsche medizinische Wochenschrift (1946),14394413; 00120472,Georg Thieme Verlag,Germany,Lübbe W,"IQWiG, Germany's equivalent to Britain's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), has adopted an unorthodox method of cost-effectiveness analysis. The method does not use QALYs (quality adjusted life years). Its main point is that it tries to avoid comparative judgement on the relative value of treatment effects in different medical areas. The present contribution assesses the controversy that has arisen over IQWiG's methods by discussing a) whether comparative judgements will at least implicitly be made anyway as soon as the IQWiG makes reimbursement recommendations in more than one medical area, and b) whether the well-known fairness objections against QALY maximization can plausibly be dealt with by equity weigthing or, generally, by moving on to ""societal value"" maximization, which tries to include fairness values in addition to cost-effectiveness. It is concluded that the answer is ""No"" for both points, which leads to a ""No"" for the title question as well.",135,12,582,585,Actuarial science; Relative value; Judgement; Equity (finance); Excellence; Reimbursement; Cost effectiveness; Cost-effectiveness analysis; Quality-adjusted life year; Medicine; Economics,,"Cost-Benefit Analysis/methods; Germany; Models, Econometric; Practice Guidelines as Topic; Quality-Adjusted Life Years",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20234995,http://dx.doi.org/10.1055/s-0030-1249215,20234995,10.1055/s-0030-1249215,2402429743; 2324962258; 2464741769,,0,,4
056-928-581-862-768,External noise distinguishes attention mechanisms.,,1998,journal article,Vision research,00426989; 18785646,Elsevier Limited,United Kingdom,Zhong-Lin Lu; Barbara Anne Dosher,"We developed and tested a powerful method for identifying and characterizing the effect of attention on performance in visual tasks as due to signal enhancement, distractor exclusion, or internal noise suppression. Based on a noisy Perceptual Template Model (PTM) of a human observer, the method adds increasing amounts of external noise (white gaussian random noise) to the visual stimulus and observes the effect on performance of a perceptual task for attended and unattended stimuli. The three mechanisms of attention yield three ""signature"" patterns of performance. The general framework for characterizing the mechanisms of attention is used here to investigate the attentional mechanisms in a concurrent location-cued orientation discrimination task. Test stimuli--Gabor patches tilted slightly to the right or left--always appeared on both the left and the right of fixation, and varied independently. Observers were cued on each trial to attend to the left, the right, or evenly to both stimuli, and decide the direction of tilt of both test stimuli. For eight levels of added external noise and three attention conditions (attended, unattended, and equal), subjects' contrast threshold levels were determined. At low levels of external noise, attention affected threshold contrast: threshold contrasts for non-attended stimuli were systematically higher than for equal attention stimuli, which were, in turn, higher than for attended stimuli. Specifically, when the rms contrast of the external noise is below 10%, there is a consistent 17% elevation of contrast threshold from attended to unattended condition across all three subjects. For higher levels of external noise, attention conditions did not affect threshold contrast values at all. These strong results are characteristic of a signal enhancement, or equivalently, an internal additive noise reduction mechanism of attention.",38,9,1183,1198,Stimulus (physiology); Psychophysics; Psychology; Noise reduction; Vigilance (psychology); Perception; Image noise; Audiology; Contrast (statistics); Social psychology; Cued speech,,"Attention; Cues; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Neurological; Psychophysics; Rotation; Sensory Thresholds/physiology; Visual Perception/physiology",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9666987 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/9666987/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0042698997002733 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82658710.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00273-3,9666987,10.1016/s0042-6989(97)00273-3,2011485556,,1,000-876-430-609-593; 001-311-796-635-006; 001-567-362-213-921; 001-653-377-699-603; 004-719-634-758-650; 005-808-049-298-076; 006-387-005-654-546; 008-458-770-423-647; 010-451-104-746-233; 011-564-022-853-040; 011-992-785-838-341; 014-009-260-910-895; 014-507-793-750-937; 016-963-160-397-696; 019-205-207-166-227; 023-370-064-023-846; 025-400-808-843-001; 026-162-051-489-164; 026-644-659-840-209; 030-085-698-667-02X; 031-960-994-418-967; 032-298-225-113-301; 033-115-806-145-717; 033-186-371-334-540; 035-841-298-157-47X; 036-885-537-006-38X; 037-801-183-768-234; 044-217-944-266-572; 045-114-826-948-382; 046-103-353-838-644; 047-123-318-345-961; 048-662-404-373-060; 049-570-004-087-901; 050-276-604-535-681; 054-167-151-130-595; 054-187-505-435-627; 056-795-462-376-461; 057-600-246-374-203; 057-787-095-593-144; 059-363-699-172-571; 063-276-804-357-965; 065-288-499-262-783; 066-496-113-813-97X; 075-812-509-749-220; 079-713-789-250-484; 086-227-279-671-57X; 090-452-656-670-923; 090-968-880-921-771; 093-775-740-441-168; 095-706-794-082-846; 097-096-005-648-85X; 101-483-170-386-681; 109-508-466-832-803; 111-451-830-070-209; 111-569-091-573-454; 117-409-320-484-89X; 121-192-895-866-522; 129-798-750-606-102; 134-589-821-529-459; 135-756-034-467-748; 137-830-905-062-451; 143-133-257-555-621; 150-045-446-626-445; 151-772-143-119-478; 153-982-886-663-421; 158-625-097-196-062; 159-194-489-256-073; 162-362-537-602-339; 174-935-566-002-536; 185-231-536-846-66X; 186-287-401-822-379; 199-055-961-488-187,440

Scholz; Martin Meißner; Ralf Wagner,"Despite the recent methodological progress to unburden respondents in preference analysis the quality of consumers’ judgements is fundamental for marketing research results. Surprisingly, the impact of ambiguous and erroneous judgments given by the respondents is widely neglected in the marketing literature. In this paper we compare the Analytic Hierarchy Process and Conjoint Analysis with respect to the impact of random errors as well as ambiguities in preference statements by means of Monte Carlo simulation studies. Referring to Thurstone’s law of comparative judgements, we demonstrate the superior robustness of the Analytic Hierarchy Process in dealing with these kinds of perturbing effects.",,,613,618,Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Judgement; Conjoint analysis; Preference analysis; Preference measurement; Marketing research; Social psychology; Analytic hierarchy process; Robustness (computer science),,,,,https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F3-540-32539-5_96 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-32539-5_96,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/3-540-32539-5_96,,10.1007/3-540-32539-5_96,1592381550,,0,005-856-953-318-932; 009-093-127-555-162; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-076-180-511-071; 065-906-991-595-286; 067-341-125-020-782; 110-045-005-185-081; 159-995-256-927-593,5

Whitty; Courtney J. Wright; Clare Townsend; Dianne Smith; Ali Lakhani; Samantha Kennerley,"Identifying the housing preferences of people with complex disabilities is a much needed, but under-developed area of practice and scholarship. Despite the recognition that housing is a social determinant of health and quality of life, there is an absence of empirical methodologies that can practically and systematically involve consumers in this complex service delivery and housing design market. A rigorous process for making effective and consistent development decisions is needed to ensure resources are used effectively and the needs of consumers with complex disability are properly met. This 3-year project aims to identify how the public and private housing market in Australia can better respond to the needs of people with complex disabilities whilst simultaneously achieving key corporate objectives. First, using the Customer Relationship Management framework, qualitative (Nominal Group Technique) and quantitative (Discrete Choice Experiment) methods will be used to quantify the housing preferences of consumers and their carers. A systematic mixed-method, quasi-experimental design will then be used to quantify the development priorities of other key stakeholders (e.g., architects, developers, Government housing services etc.) in relation to inclusive housing for people with complex disabilities. Stakeholders randomly assigned to Group 1 (experimental group) will participate in a series of focus groups employing Analytical Hierarchical Process (AHP) methodology. Stakeholders randomly assigned to Group 2 (control group) will participate in focus groups employing existing decision making processes to inclusive housing development (e.g., Risk, Opportunity, Cost, Benefit considerations). Using comparative stakeholder analysis, this research design will enable the AHP methodology (a proposed tool to guide inclusive housing development decisions) to be tested. It is anticipated that the findings of this study will enable stakeholders to incorporate consumer housing preferences into commercial decisions. Housing designers and developers will benefit from the creation of a parsimonious set of consumer-led housing preferences by which to make informed investments in future housing and contribute to future housing policy. The research design has not been applied in the Australian research context or elsewhere, and will provide a much needed blueprint for market investment to develop viable, consumer directed inclusive housing options for people with complex disability.",16,1,261,261,Blueprint; Marketing; Stakeholder analysis; Consumer behaviour; Needs assessment; Public housing; Focus group; Service delivery framework; Nominal group technique; Medicine; Environmental health,Analytical hierarchical process; Decision making; Disability housing; High care needs; Neurological disability; Public housing; Social housing; Supported housing,Adolescent; Adult; Australia; Caregivers; Choice Behavior; Consumer Behavior; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Decision Making; Disabled Persons/psychology; Female; Focus Groups; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Needs Assessment; Public Housing; Quality of Life; Research Design; Trauma Severity Indices; Young Adult,,Australian Research Council,https://core.ac.uk/display/43392041 https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/58364/ https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4791886 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:385016 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4791886/ https://research-repository.griffith.edu.au/handle/10072/99372 https://espace.curtin.edu.au/handle/20.500.11937/36936 https://paperity.org/p/75968727/study-protocol-developing-a-decision-system-for-inclusive-housing-applying-a-systematic https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26975348/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81209731.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x,26975348,10.1186/s12889-016-2936-x,2297369105,PMC4791886,0,001-471-193-715-27X; 005-078-809-053-994; 005-354-038-050-362; 005-846-288-491-743; 009-881-393-198-900; 011-318-329-287-385; 016-192-199-262-366; 016-616-121-548-627; 016-865-261-177-44X; 017-424-948-415-144; 018-030-627-289-321; 019-823-865-196-557; 020-197-966-214-005; 020-780-700-688-244; 026-582-284-480-399; 026-728-673-180-065; 027-294-091-539-323; 028-378-730-332-850; 028-417-432-189-514; 029-234-544-863-694; 029-615-367-155-687; 030-628-699-900-194; 032-628-990-718-411; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-301-366-981-700; 037-718-667-935-96X; 038-977-378-775-093; 040-185-137-948-551; 042-627-416-303-850; 044-218-788-214-512; 044-838-550-778-630; 051-987-790-435-795; 054-702-067-377-669; 057-657-809-679-383; 059-079-112-655-817; 064-950-152-959-896; 065-507-676-685-574; 066-441-802-038-704; 072-722-850-081-81X; 080-986-410-560-875; 084-161-402-094-703; 094-617-249-231-649; 095-600-715-094-983; 099-150-317-608-133; 100-699-307-024-742; 122-259-977-999-310; 124-754-008-004-098; 125-513-366-485-249; 128-200-781-285-30X; 130-581-929-817-389; 137-499-750-422-928; 142-967-418-672-453; 146-991-505-732-448; 165-782-043-991-063; 188-993-492-032-663; 192-305-413-301-910,2

Despite the frequent appeal in everyday life to the nihilistic interpretation of the saying ‘It's all a matter of taste’, the doctrine of aesthetic nihilism—the view that such claims are never warranted—does not merit serious attention. What is needed is an articulation of the various kinds of content of aesthetic judgements, one that will reveal what their claim to intersubjective validity amounts to and enable an assessment of what the proper limits of the claim might be. This clarification is what I attempt to provide. After some introductory definitions and classifications, the principal focus of the first part of the paper is descriptive aesthetic judgements, and one issue that figures large is the proper understanding of those judgements of this kind which are expressed in sentences that are intended to be understood metaphorically. A short bridge passage identifies an aesthetic judgement whose content is indicative of the content of evaluative aesthetic judgements of all kinds, and in particular evaluative aesthetic judgements about works of art, which the second part of the paper focuses on. Real illumination of these requires an identification of the aim of art (as such): I offer an account of this aim, which I defend against certain objections that it is liable to attract, and I use it to throw light not just on singular but also on comparative judgements of artistic value. I conclude with some remarks about purely aesthetic value and specifically artistic value and about similarities and differences between evaluative aesthetic judgements of works of art and evaluative aesthetic judgements of works of nature.",47,4,333,371,Aesthetics; Epistemology; Psychology; Doctrine; Judgement; Intersubjectivity; Appeal; Everyday life; Aesthetic value; Expression (mathematics),,,,,http://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/47/4/333/8879/ https://academic.oup.com/bjaesthetics/article-abstract/47/4/333/8879/ https://philpapers.org/rec/BUDTIV,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/aesthj/aym021,,10.1093/aesthj/aym021,2037107229,,0,,10

Field experiments show that information about low absolute and relative performance of local government household waste recycling services lowers citizens' perceptions of performance, and information about high absolute and relative performance raises perceived performance. Relative information makes citizens judge local providers as being more responsible for outcomes in the case of high performance, suggesting that systems for comparative performance reporting increase local accountability for outcomes.

058-656-871-632-334,ON THE INHIBITORY EFFECTS OF EXTRAPOLATED STIMULI IN THE SUCCESSIVE COMPARISON OF BRIGHTNESS (II),,1959,journal article,Japanese Journal of Psychology,18841082,,,Hisashi Maeda,"From the results in our first report, it is presumed that an extra-stimulus (e), which is presented preceding the two comparative stimuli (N and V), has two different inhibitory effects upon the successive comparison of brightness, in addition to the so-called assimilation-contrast effect. In this second report, further analyses were made to test the existence of these two effects of e more in detail. (Regarding procedure and condions, see the first report).The main results were as follows:1) When e (physically equivalent to N in brightness) was presented immediately following N and the inhibitory after-effect of e upon the excitation of N was eliminated, the tendency for the negative time-error disappeared at shorter time-intervals between N and V. And, in reverse, the time-error shifted noticeably toward a positive direction, i.e., V was underestimated. But when the time-interval was made longer, underestimation of N occurred in the same way as when e was presented immediately preceding N, though its magnitude was relatively small (Exp. V, see Fig. 3).2) According to obserbers' introsections, e was seen a little darker than N there, especially at shorter intervals. But the comparative judgement between N and V was not so difficult at shorter intervals, even if e was interpolated between them. On the other hand, the fusing proccess had advanced between images of N and e at longer intervals. And he was forced to take a strong analytical attitude to separate images of N and e, to compare N with V directly.3) These tendencies mentioned above were still noticed, when the brightness of e was made phenomenally equivalent to that of N, to eliminate more perfectly the assimilation effect occurrable between them (Exp. VI, see Fig. 4).4) When two light-spots, placed by side in a horizontal line, were presented twice and a spatial grouping was produced in place of a temporal grouping between the two preceding stimuli, the tendency for the negative time-error disappeared again and the error shifted slightly toward a positive direction at shorter time-intervals. However, at longer time-intervals the error shifted toward a negative direction. Moreover, the image of the first stimulus-figure had become vague rather rapidly in spite of impressiveness on its appearance (Exp. III, see Fig. 1).5) The above-mentioned tendencies were still noticed when the brightness of the stimulus-figure in the experimental series was made phenomenally equivalent to that in the control series (where a light-spot was presented twice in succession) to eliminate the central tendency occurrable between these two series (Exp. IV, see Fig. 2).6) In addition, it was verified that the shift of time-error toward a negative direction seen at longer intervals by presenting e befor N, was never due to that e, in place of N, was compared with V, or that the level of N was assimilated to that of e (Exp. I, II).From these results in the first report and the second one, it is concluded that the after-effect of e which inhibits the perceptual excitation of N certainly exists; but that underestimation of N seen at longer intervals throughout these experiments is rather commonly caused by the inhibitory effect, perhaps similiar to the Kohler-Restorff effect, which has progressed in the field of memory trace with the passage of time.",30,1,161,172,Combinatorics; Brightness; Horizontal line test; Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Inhibitory effect; Positive direction; Assimilation (phonology),,,,,https://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/jjpsy1926/30.8?from=CrossRef,https://joi.jlc.jst.go.jp/JST.Journalarchive/jjpsy1926/30.8?from=CrossRef,,,2323371045,,0,,3

The first concerns the development of an e-portfolio system that enables learners to capture evidence of their activity (using hand-held devices in the workshop/studio/science lab/playing field) and to lodge it in a web-space where their portfolio emerges dynamically, in real-time. Teachers and examination bodies can interact with this system to a greater or lesser extent according to the circumstances. If the activity is part of a formal examination, then the Awarding Body can specify the task and the activity framework (all of which can be downloaded by the school) and teachers in many schools can then run the same activity in a standard way. If the activity is a normal piece of curriculum, then teachers can design activities for individuals or groups of learners and either run them with the learners, or enable the learners themselves to work through the activity autonomously. In any event, the outcome of all this is a web-portfolio.; The second innovation concerns the assessment of these portfolios. Using comparative judgement and the pairs engine, groups of teachers and/or examiners can collaborate in the assessment of groups of portfolios. This might be for an Awarding Body, with the results counting towards an official award, or it might be within a school, where collaborating teachers use the data for their own purposes. These two innovations were launched in 2009 with the final report of phase 3 of the e-scape project. The purpose of this concluding piece is to reflect on what has happened since then; on the extent to which these innovations have been adopted in various parts of the world and the issues that this adoption is raising. Sometimes the adoption has been of only one of the innovations (either the portfolio-building or the comparative judgement), and sometimes it has been both",22,2,265,270,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-011-9196-y,,10.1007/s10798-011-9196-y,,,0,,2

Repeated judgements and the use of a suitable sorting algorithm allow marked to be derived from a rank order of scripts. Feedback can be added to each script as it is judged.; We have evaluated the use of adaptive comparative judgement for peer assessment and feedback using a case study in the third year of a Pharmacy programme. The exercise consisted of five parts each of 100 words.; Each student conducted 10 judgements and left feedback, which was of overall very high quality. The assessment, however, was less successful. Students’ judgements were not very consistent with one another, nor with staff assessment. This contrasts with a previous exercise, in which the student assessment was of high reliability but the feedback was less good.; This exercise was successful in promoting mutual support among students through the giving and receiving of feedback. We conclude, however, that for optimum use of adaptive comparative judgement for peer assessment, a hierarchical marking scheme is required, but students should be encouraged to give feedback on all aspects of the assessment.",12,1,50,60,Sorting algorithm; Psychology; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Mutual support; Peer-to-peer; Peer assessment; Contrast (statistics); Scripting language; Applied psychology,,,,,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/514,http://ojs.cumbria.ac.uk/index.php/prhe/article/view/514,,,2964188169,,0,,0

Smith; Andrew Street,"It has long been standard practice to ask patients in clinical trials about their health status, but the practice is now being extended to patients receiving treatment on a routine basis. In this paper, we examine four types of analyses that these health data might inform: comparisons of alternative treatments for the same condition, of health care providers, of changes in performance over time and of treatments of different types of condition. Analytical challenges arise because counterfactuals cannot be observed and because health status cannot be measured continuously. The implications of these challenges and the ability to meet them vary according to the comparative exercise. We argue that, provided with a sufficient number of health status measures for each patient and proper risk adjustment, health status measurement has great potential to inform the first three types of comparison. However, we believe that it is not yet possible to use such data to make secure comparative judgements about the outcomes from treatment for different types of condition.",22,2,119,131,Psychiatry; Health care; MEDLINE; Outcome assessment; Risk adjustment; Health data; Health outcomes; Family medicine; Clinical trial; Quality-adjusted life year; Medicine,,"Health Status; Humans; Models, Statistical; Outcome Assessment, Health Care; Patients; Quality-Adjusted Life Years; Self Report",,,https://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/22238023 https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/hec.2793 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22238023 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:wly:hlthec:v:22:y:2013:i:2:p:119-131 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/22238023/ https://ideas.repec.org/a/wly/hlthec/v22y2013i2p119-131.html,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/hec.2793,22238023,10.1002/hec.2793,2097536184,,0,002-040-804-305-547; 009-292-193-771-113; 014-300-191-711-158; 014-408-969-415-515; 020-869-666-603-040; 023-726-901-857-333; 028-323-776-645-993; 029-904-470-397-159; 033-213-535-228-64X; 036-146-366-342-485; 042-964-900-308-183; 050-158-259-190-733; 059-161-254-027-448; 078-703-962-067-961; 084-243-561-168-844; 092-650-442-529-588; 100-710-430-255-217; 122-685-609-280-363; 139-702-298-521-199; 183-433-160-467-786,41

On the basis of examples of unjust situations derived from Sen's writings, the article discusses the limited reach of The Idea of Justice in addressing concrete cases of injustice. It contends that remedying injustice requires an understanding of how justice is structural, which recognises that discussion of justice is inseparable from reasoning about the nature of the good society.

Riege; Karl Halvor Teigen,"When people are asked to estimate the probabilities for an exhaustive set of more than two events, they often produce probabilities that add up to more than 100%. Potential determinants for such additivity neglect are explored in four experiments. Additive responses vary between experimental conditions, mainly as a result of response format, with a scale format leading to fewer additive responses than a list format with self-generated, written probabilities. Participants with high numeracy scores produced more additive responses, especially after being primed with a numeracy scale. Additivity neglect for 100% sums appears to be unrelated to other subadditive judgments, like non-additive disjunctions. We conclude that additivity neglect is caused by a case-based approach, which comes natural in real-life situations where the full set of outcomes is not available.",121,1,41,52,Econometrics; Subadditivity; Neglect; Mathematics; Additive function; Numeracy,,,,,http://eprints.kingston.ac.uk/35944/ http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597812001288 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jobhdp/v121y2013i1p41-52.html https://core.ac.uk/display/74396031 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0749597812001288 https://EconPapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:jobhdp:v:121:y:2013:i:1:p:41-52,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.11.004,,10.1016/j.obhdp.2012.11.004,1999244575,,0,002-232-212-298-191; 004-208-505-519-456; 005-083-320-255-060; 005-664-895-246-742; 005-674-397-268-980; 007-425-618-461-342; 009-161-614-136-40X; 009-205-464-786-870; 009-206-967-031-917; 010-003-191-094-552; 010-352-786-329-889; 011-421-734-759-10X; 011-993-023-817-311; 013-310-366-816-887; 013-847-203-519-212; 019-455-591-312-867; 022-311-790-088-496; 023-202-665-891-558; 024-302-700-331-164; 027-841-346-468-61X; 032-152-939-514-535; 034-211-272-440-012; 037-035-948-618-327; 037-742-451-015-507; 040-670-241-805-365; 045-570-199-306-354; 047-277-225-047-131; 049-484-312-004-88X; 050-638-727-101-192; 052-469-112-202-403; 052-480-760-158-495; 053-603-121-864-91X; 053-800-456-174-411; 054-263-573-003-035; 056-672-370-150-588; 058-621-116-811-996; 062-738-367-496-162; 064-913-600-030-00X; 064-966-564-119-742; 065-052-047-308-428; 068-481-592-791-19X; 071-501-822-669-020; 072-215-529-962-577; 076-640-821-206-579; 085-441-795-887-861; 086-303-752-454-24X; 088-681-594-691-485; 091-185-840-036-466; 097-580-961-675-940; 098-865-169-230-740; 098-950-277-295-601; 100-455-378-867-244; 100-593-529-191-989; 101-513-178-344-958; 101-933-856-573-698; 120-862-737-744-881; 127-315-592-573-197; 133-468-971-259-047; 137-827-099-647-49X; 138-613-710-331-856; 141-970-126-010-096; 148-223-435-969-407; 153-717-393-801-040; 164-120-172-706-581; 175-029-298-028-642; 176-213-237-801-204,14

Consequently, benchmarking, which evaluates comparative advantages of leading competitors and identifies best practices, has been employed by many service firms. As part of effort to extend its scope, integration of quality function deployment (QFD) and benchmarking has been proposed in previous research. However, sufficient analysis on activities of both firms, including its own firm and its competitor, was not possible due to the use of a single QFD. In response, this paper suggests a dual QFD as a means for benchmarking service quality. A dual QFD makes it possible to conduct detailed analysis on competitor's activities and on relationship between activities of the two firms, which should be preceded by benchmarking. From the structural perspective, this paper modifies original QFD into dual QFD by relocating benchmarking matrix to the main frame an...",26,5,569,582,Competitor analysis; Service quality; Best practice; Process management; Operations management; Computer science; Comparative advantage; Benchmarking; Quality function deployment,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14783363.2013.860696 https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=5027213,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/14783363.2013.860696,,,2163037314,,0,001-386-828-970-842; 002-187-410-101-601; 002-432-260-051-325; 004-961-082-863-510; 015-804-698-270-465; 018-946-653-183-870; 024-660-841-467-639; 025-022-107-474-80X; 025-721-298-170-077; 029-161-104-682-123; 030-628-234-997-248; 031-873-519-098-831; 036-600-244-715-439; 049-029-493-974-943; 049-947-799-905-863; 075-390-355-403-464; 080-214-100-468-088; 080-491-705-826-904; 084-986-581-370-828; 108-512-420-405-246; 111-698-390-799-534; 117-536-159-928-491; 118-334-576-790-842; 124-890-253-043-927; 133-130-072-766-653; 154-819-770-460-426; 160-350-923-683-690; 173-507-611-729-092,6

Rodzon; Kerry E. Jordan,"Both time and numerosity can be represented continuously as analog properties whose discrimination conforms to Weber’s Law, suggesting that the two properties may be represented similarly. Recent research suggests that the representation of time is influenced by the presence of emotional stimuli. If time and numerosity share a common cognitive representation, it follows that a similar relationship may exist between emotional stimuli and the representation of numerosity. Here, we provide evidence that emotional stimuli significantly affect humans’ estimation of visual numerosity. During a numerical bisection task, enumeration of emotional stimuli (angry faces) was more accurate compared to enumeration of neutrally valenced stimuli (neutral faces), demonstrating that emotional stimuli affect humans’ visual representation of numerosity as previously demonstrated for time. These results inform and broaden our understanding of the effect of negative emotional stimuli on psychophysical discriminations of quantity.",4,,521,521,Valence (psychology); Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Numerosity adaptation effect; Neuroscience; Cognition; Cognitive psychology; Emotional stimuli; Bisection; Numerical cognition,Weber’s Law; emotion; numerical cognition; quantitative discrimination; quantity,,,,http://journal.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/abstract http://core.ac.uk/display/25902669 https://philpapers.org/rec/BAKTIO-7 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23950754 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521/pdf http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC3739062 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82885793.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521,23950754,10.3389/fpsyg.2013.00521,2054071718,PMC3739062,0,000-301-185-197-734; 001-347-300-765-064; 003-756-834-371-246; 003-761-055-942-579; 004-731-567-191-050; 004-752-549-821-429; 006-556-515-196-690; 007-982-164-129-004; 007-996-363-197-55X; 008-440-730-412-606; 009-172-333-696-965; 009-420-062-605-493; 009-798-900-720-146; 013-038-761-988-056; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-974-377-547-330; 016-227-375-936-145; 016-678-955-117-94X; 019-490-776-168-383; 020-392-504-269-769; 020-512-833-958-294; 021-693-057-817-131; 022-809-584-107-682; 023-108-369-375-523; 023-637-815-133-879; 024-168-323-406-145; 024-607-781-626-606; 025-411-961-000-469; 025-596-868-936-020; 026-803-444-839-337; 027-885-565-129-778; 029-582-367-526-339; 034-982-292-185-771; 035-933-244-514-345; 037-436-823-090-386; 039-742-935-448-969; 044-388-441-968-173; 046-535-255-782-80X; 047-880-987-110-72X; 048-373-971-491-687; 048-952-966-839-251; 049-365-634-170-299; 049-782-484-836-522; 050-025-386-545-745; 051-472-129-782-759; 053-459-828-789-403; 055-643-503-860-593; 057-183-336-446-253; 057-349-983-849-38X; 057-877-558-474-926; 060-645-774-719-735; 064-533-953-664-476; 070-382-759-482-419; 070-813-577-890-413; 074-017-562-218-104; 077-489-033-113-862; 078-289-929-152-661; 080-354-103-723-747; 082-391-920-356-292; 091-814-028-345-11X; 094-332-042-747-219; 098-605-034-406-998; 103-974-904-022-158; 104-898-249-163-45X; 112-502-745-192-029; 118-581-038-700-756; 131-852-428-639-615; 133-323-798-067-270; 134-702-076-457-337; 144-641-185-507-109; 156-119-548-171-717,14

The impact of counting strategies on these configurations and their possible semantic status were investigated in young adults. Experiment 1 showed that young adults named numerical finger configurations faster when they conformed to their own canonical finger-counting habits than when they did not. Experiment 2 showed that numeral finger configurations used as unconsciously presented primes speeded up numerical comparative judgements of Arabic numeral targets. Participants responded faster and made fewer errors with numerical than with non-numerical primes, and when primes and targets were congruent (i.e., leading to the same response). Moreover, this priming effect generalised to novel never consciously seen numerosities for canonical configurations but not for non-canonical ones.

Brewer,"We investigated the role of global discourse organization on the comprehension of temporal order in narrative. We proposed three principles of discourse organization: (a) the immediate integration principle--- new event should be integrated immediately with old information, (b) the consistency principle---a new event should be attached to a consistent locus, and (c) the isomorphism principle---discourse structure should match event structure. Five passages varying in discourse structure were presented auditorily, and the comprehension of the underlying event order was tested. Subjects' comprehension was best in the canonical passage. The backward, flashback, and embedded passages were significantly more difficult than the canonical passages. The flashforward passage was the most difficult. The results were interpreted as showing that the immediate integration principle is a strong component of comprehension of temporal order and that the isomorphism principle contributes to text comprehension, but to a lesser degree.",15,3,317,336,Isomorphism; Narrative; Event structure; Reading comprehension; Text comprehension; Computer science; Linguistics; Comprehension; Discourse analysis; Mental representation,,,,,https://psycnet.apa.org/record/1993-20278-001 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ457057 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01638539209544815 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/01638539209544815 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10826554.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/151483092 http://vuir.vu.edu.au/751/ http://vuir.vu.edu.au/751/1/OhtsukaBrewer92.pdf http://eprints.vu.edu.au/751/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01638539209544815,,10.1080/01638539209544815,2069257487,,0,001-724-030-390-848; 002-168-255-548-644; 003-297-184-784-128; 009-030-278-073-277; 013-465-055-557-706; 015-842-054-724-043; 016-378-997-694-580; 019-834-183-465-055; 020-175-302-428-644; 022-886-286-831-989; 025-758-506-777-500; 026-214-083-464-780; 027-888-041-726-233; 028-636-062-026-83X; 036-173-424-576-436; 038-332-085-941-379; 038-740-551-085-120; 040-450-540-136-726; 041-131-380-809-378; 043-736-970-280-341; 050-321-468-261-304; 054-282-260-997-861; 055-406-976-043-746; 064-931-720-687-048; 073-545-864-868-877; 073-593-638-384-061; 076-182-385-950-215; 084-314-128-809-239; 094-995-963-173-560; 096-852-020-963-262; 102-054-861-557-436; 112-539-620-207-302; 121-381-184-593-946; 137-186-252-095-12X; 154-866-841-745-691; 162-313-651-880-42X; 171-714-867-238-376; 198-163-126-267-729,82

Scobbie,"Cleft Palate (CP) assessments based on phonetic transcription are the ""gold standard"" therapy outcome measure, despite reliability difficulties. Here we propose a novel perceptual evaluation, applied to ultrasound-visual biofeedback (U-VBF) therapy and therapy using visual articulatory models (VAMs) for two children with repaired submucous CP. Three comparisons were made: post VAM, post U-VBF and overall pre- and post-therapy. Twenty-two phonetically-trained listeners were asked to determine whether pre- or post-therapy recordings sounded ""closer to the English target"", using their own implicit phonological knowledge (prompted via orthographic representation). Results are compared with segment-oriented percent target consonant correct (PTCC) derived from phonetic transcriptions. Listener judgements and PTCC suggest that both children made improvements using both VAM and U-VBF. Statistical analysis showed listener agreement in each comparison, though agreement was weak. However, perceptual evaluation offers a straightforward method of evaluating the effectiveness of interventions and can be used by phonetically trained or lay listeners.",30,3-5,398,415,Psychology; Transcription (linguistics); Perception; Biofeedback; Phonetic transcription; Consonant; Submucous cleft palate; Therapy outcome measure; Statistical analysis; Linguistics; Audiology,Cleft palate; perceptual speech evaluation; ultrasound; visual articulatory models,"Articulation Disorders/diagnostic imaging; Biofeedback, Psychology; Child; Cleft Palate/surgery; Humans; Language; Male; Phonetics; Speech; Ultrasonography",,Queen Margaret University,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477 https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/multiple-phonetically-trainedlistener-comparisons-of-speech-before-and-after-articulatory-intervention-in-two-children-with-repaired-submucous-cleft-palate(8886d2a4-9208-4b5a-bfb6-8b94ca93100f)/export.html https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/55416/ https://eresearch.qmu.ac.uk/handle/20.500.12289/4265/ https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26901243 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/multiple-phonetically-trained-listener-comparisons-of-speech-befo http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/26901243 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/141197462.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477,26901243,10.3109/02699206.2015.1135477,2253370600,,0,001-315-816-076-394; 008-041-809-197-613; 009-372-676-342-671; 009-824-423-512-470; 010-301-055-317-622; 015-020-190-202-212; 021-150-611-033-895; 023-468-392-535-299; 026-146-054-603-663; 028-581-083-911-20X; 030-714-304-671-982; 035-296-852-321-37X; 044-371-399-680-449; 062-979-943-769-948; 066-722-464-799-316; 071-784-526-493-369; 072-899-493-722-159; 075-150-794-733-673; 077-380-915-534-563; 079-548-160-949-785; 083-341-153-259-678; 083-399-008-517-10X; 098-817-322-661-277; 102-293-898-726-617; 106-577-959-156-073; 110-585-938-190-488; 115-973-306-873-842; 117-259-216-851-492; 117-316-780-007-872; 141-736-239-680-568; 143-480-868-939-209; 148-674-063-231-462; 156-602-657-780-001; 168-423-330-977-509,3

However, Temple and Posner (1998) used ERPs and the numerical distance task with 5-year-olds to show that the development of numerical representations is difficult to disentangle from the development of the executive components of response organization and execution. Here we use the numerical Stroop paradigm (NSP) and ERPs to study possible executive interference in numerical processing tasks in 6–8-year-old children. In the NSP, the numerical magnitude of the digits is task-relevant and the physical size of the digits is task-irrelevant. We show that younger children are highly susceptible to interference from irrelevant physical information such as digit size, but that access to the numerical representation is almost as fast in young children as in adults. We argue that the developmental trajectories for executive function and numerical processing may act together to determine numerical development in young children.",21,6,662,671,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Executive functions; Physical information; Stroop Paradigm; Numeracy; Event-related potential; Diagnostic test,,,,Medical Research Council,https://eprints.qut.edu.au/39900/ https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/375340/ https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608010001238 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ945132 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1041608010001238 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10902450.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.004,,10.1016/j.lindif.2010.10.004,1999541205,,0,000-165-094-703-589; 001-244-253-407-376; 004-121-572-754-93X; 005-201-806-256-367; 006-688-443-167-296; 008-059-893-696-890; 009-420-844-660-497; 009-691-999-497-895; 010-399-174-723-779; 011-247-436-249-24X; 013-621-298-749-675; 015-012-693-948-294; 017-035-527-353-329; 019-777-112-821-405; 024-265-305-316-415; 026-192-606-495-566; 030-242-387-577-541; 031-541-539-785-70X; 031-842-221-342-270; 032-809-037-593-864; 035-402-974-768-248; 036-403-728-589-122; 037-819-011-672-40X; 038-395-026-012-885; 038-406-658-229-135; 040-939-699-593-009; 042-108-554-770-743; 043-059-717-074-397; 043-288-458-558-686; 045-735-184-813-268; 048-935-524-968-684; 049-303-487-116-044; 052-522-619-080-29X; 057-349-983-849-38X; 064-672-833-839-016; 064-840-750-332-99X; 066-089-489-617-442; 066-451-801-924-025; 067-033-829-394-657; 072-849-353-462-759; 073-421-541-399-194; 074-225-283-011-852; 086-922-926-484-143; 087-709-692-997-280; 088-849-249-876-733; 091-814-028-345-11X; 092-578-007-780-619; 093-171-874-765-291; 095-781-921-173-549; 104-898-249-163-45X; 110-878-263-543-335; 116-093-617-267-98X; 120-204-913-104-353; 121-989-153-587-995; 129-827-356-327-594; 145-140-986-126-382; 148-214-528-359-814; 152-406-182-124-102; 168-995-538-712-95X; 172-354-053-239-150; 194-903-265-762-557,18

The prevalence of overweight perceptions and their impact on well-being may have increased over the past decade due to an increase in the salience of weight-related issues. This study examines trends (2002–2014) in the prevalence of adolescent overweight perceptions and their association with psychosomatic complaints. Methods Data from 15-year-old adolescents were obtained between 2002 and 2014 in four rounds of the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study in 33 countries in Europe and North America (N = 187,511). Design-adjusted logistic regressions were used to quantify changes in overweight perceptions over time. Linear modeling was used to assess change in the association between perceived overweight and self-reported psychosomatic complaint burden, adjusting for overweight status. Results Among boys, 10 of 33 countries saw an increase in overweight perceptions between 2002 and 2014, with Russia, Estonia, and Latvia showing the most pronounced year-on-year increases. Only England, France, Germany, and Norway saw an increase in the positive association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints among boys. Among girls, most countries (28/33) saw no change in the prevalence of overweight perceptions, with the prevalence over 40% in most nations. However, in 12 countries, the association between overweight perceptions and psychosomatic complaints increased among girls, with particularly strong changes seen in Scotland and Norway. Conclusions Evidence is presented which suggests that for adolescent girls in 12 Northern and Western European countries and for boys in four perceiving oneself as overweight may be increasingly deleterious for psychosomatic health.",60,2,204,211,Psychiatry; Demography; Logistic regression; Salience (language); Perception; Overweight; Complaint; Mental well-being; Health behaviour; Medicine; Correlation and dependence,Adolescents; Body image; Body size perception; Mental well-being; Overweight; Perceived body fatness; Psychosomatic symptoms,Adolescent; Adolescent Behavior/psychology; Adolescent Health; Body Image/psychology; Cross-Sectional Studies; Europe/epidemiology; Female; Health Surveys; Humans; Logistic Models; Male; North America/epidemiology; Overweight/epidemiology; Self Concept; Sex Factors,,,https://jyx.jyu.fi/bitstream/123456789/56155/1/whiteheadetalmanuscript260916.pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/147247220 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27939879 http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/27939879 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1054139X16303780 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27939879/ https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/12191 https://jyx.jyu.fi/handle/123456789/56155 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/132612344.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.09.029,27939879,10.1016/j.jadohealth.2016.09.029,2558635644,,0,004-956-709-973-726; 005-283-400-848-727; 006-531-793-871-982; 007-683-648-588-688; 014-120-935-529-757; 014-188-760-227-255; 016-894-045-443-320; 021-008-970-034-876; 022-888-291-928-16X; 026-178-964-289-200; 026-424-163-697-168; 035-963-227-404-301; 038-238-447-508-150; 041-121-551-800-038; 041-485-192-465-713; 045-271-657-674-972; 048-060-349-109-217; 049-780-348-981-451; 053-389-790-786-74X; 060-850-280-125-26X; 062-672-021-641-554; 064-044-170-767-367; 065-866-100-042-589; 069-947-348-345-17X; 071-787-648-351-987; 073-495-388-262-942; 084-520-720-549-349; 088-710-565-435-28X; 095-378-571-087-439; 099-372-559-522-547; 099-683-841-431-380; 103-863-104-258-814; 110-730-627-990-734; 138-344-096-837-810; 143-721-805-057-684; 146-852-560-340-64X; 163-574-135-245-237; 191-135-968-702-288,15

Warrington,"We describe our investigations of the sentence comprehension abilities of 2 patients with a severe impairment in their auditory verbal short-term memory (conduction aphasia). Both were capable of comprehending a range of sentences, even when adequate comprehension was dependent upon the processing of order-dependent syntactic information rather than the utilization of semantic knowledge. Thus they performed satisfactorily on tests using plausibly reversible subject and object constituents with either active or passive verb phrases or prepositional phrases. Both, however, were impaired on sentences which departed from normal conversational conventions in terms of their reference to the order of event occurrence, or to the subject and object of an array. They were also very poor at performing comparative judgements, even when these involved a simple intrinsic attribute such as colour. These findings are discussed in terms of the role of auditory verbal short-term memory in backing up and back-tracking over spoken information when conditions preclude the immediate understanding of auditory-verbal information.",110,6,1565,1578,Psychology; Short-term memory; Cognitive psychology; Semantic memory; Memoria; Verb; Sentence; Conduction aphasia; Communication; Comprehension; Syntax,,,,,https://academic.oup.com/brain/article-abstract/110/6/1565/451559 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3427401 https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/3427401/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/brain/110.6.1565,,10.1093/brain/110.6.1565,2074539560,,0,,79

These aspects are however neglected in most examinations of mathematics and, consequentially, in classroom teaching. One barrier to the inclusion of mathematical problem solving in assessment is that the skills involved are difficult to define and assess objectively. We present two studies that test a method called comparative judgement (CJ) that might be well suited to assessing mathematical problem solving. CJ is an alternative to traditional scoring that is based on collective expert judgements of students’ work rather than item-by-item scoring schemes. In study 1, we used CJ to assess traditional mathematics tests and found it performed validly and reliably. In study 2, we used CJ to assess mathematical problem-solving tasks and again found it performed validly and reliably. We discuss the implications of the results for further research and the implications of CJ for the design of mathematical problem-solving tasks.",13,1,151,177,Mathematics education; Psychology; Judgement; Traditional mathematics; Mathematics instruction; Mathematical problem solving; Evaluation methods; Classroom teaching; Science education; Mathematical logic,,,,,https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/output/997062 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10763-013-9497-6 http://eprints.nottingham.ac.uk/32091/ https://nottingham-repository.worktribe.com/preview/997076/IJMA-D-12-01395.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Assessing_mathematical_problem_solving_using_comparative_judgement/9370325 https://dspace.lboro.ac.uk/dspace-jspui/bitstream/2134/18649/1/IJSME2014preprint.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015IJSME..13..151J/abstract https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1049618,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10763-013-9497-6,,10.1007/s10763-013-9497-6,2010575178,,0,003-116-569-551-100; 009-486-832-701-513; 014-392-940-528-758; 015-610-828-146-943; 017-792-980-099-478; 028-600-184-401-058; 029-313-938-111-247; 035-776-610-863-582; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-799-681-315-43X; 051-426-516-197-907; 051-492-788-553-405; 061-261-037-987-207; 061-869-815-688-55X; 062-546-879-061-051; 082-657-515-340-970; 085-239-911-231-861; 085-782-124-158-049; 086-070-966-327-639; 098-114-054-226-453; 105-937-076-512-724; 106-532-502-155-602; 107-790-959-417-375; 120-311-042-103-980; 130-423-056-479-881; 146-286-866-668-740; 164-086-224-126-233; 174-437-753-022-047; 179-726-268-053-176; 187-070-003-592-896,38

Dette; Andrea E. Abele; Oliver Renner,"The conceptualisation and definition of vocational success is equivocal. The present paper attempts to clarify the construct. We suggest a model that distinguishes vocational success with respect to three parameters: 1) the criterion to be assessed with the extremes of specific work and task vs. global career, 2) the data content with the distinction of external records, comparative judgements and satisfaction ratings, and 3) the data source, i.e., documents and ratings by others (both external measures) and self-report data (internal measures). We then take a closer look at career success and give an overview of current operationalizations with respect to data source and data content. Subsequently, we report findings of a meta- analysis on the relationship between external measures and internal measures of career success. The analysis yields an estimated population correlation of ρest = .28, which is homogeneous for the correlation of external measures and career satisfaction (ρest = .30), but not for external measures and self-rated career success.

This paper aims to propose an analytical pair-wise comparison approach to ranking indicators of human capital in Malaysia. The Analytic Hierarchy Process is employed to integrate the multi-facets preferences of the five criteria of human capital to determine the importance of the four identified indicators. A case study of human capital measurement is presented and the proposed model is applied to facilitate the decision making process. Interviews with three decision makers were administered to collect data over the comparative judgement of human capital measures in Malaysia. The results show that creating result by using knowledge is the most important measurement indicators and employee's skill index is the least important measurement indicator. The overall ranking reflects the importance of measurement indicators in steering Malaysia to become a worthy human capital investment.,107,,22,28,Decision-making; Business; Knowledge economy; Ranking; Judgement; Human capital; Management science; Knowledge management; Developing country; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/display/81982791 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042813050179 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81982791.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.394,,10.1016/j.sbspro.2013.12.394,1997821792,,0,011-703-868-775-055; 021-153-844-581-44X; 028-454-054-636-147; 033-711-497-118-31X; 036-745-237-774-622; 040-538-371-657-729; 041-563-025-496-329; 055-070-798-326-463; 067-341-125-020-782; 071-317-917-757-357; 071-501-420-538-845; 072-372-712-750-109; 082-523-946-615-012; 083-336-050-729-511; 086-215-877-679-071; 099-520-175-917-218; 113-914-739-374-018; 123-675-666-931-721; 128-529-978-620-742; 136-133-049-439-139; 136-871-166-460-96X; 138-045-683-285-897; 159-785-615-800-91X,12

The teacher adopted a comparative judgement approach to the assessment of secondary students’ understanding of a chemistry experiment. The aims of the research were to investigate whether comparative judgement can produce assessment outcomes that are valid and reliable without producing undue workload for the teachers involved. Comparative judgement outcomes correlated as expected both with test marks and with existing student achievement data, supporting the validity of the approach.

068-582-222-430-445,Using adaptive comparative judgement to obtain a highly reliable rank order in summative assessment,2012-06-20,2012,,,,,,Alastair Pollitt; Claire Whitehouse,"Adaptive Comparative Judgment (ACJ) offers an alternative to marking, especially for performance assessments for which achievement can be difficult to describe in mark schemes. The ACJ system uses a web-browser to deliver pairs of candidates’ work to judges. The judges apply their subject expertise to select which of the two sets of work is better in terms of meeting appropriate educational objectives. A quality parameter is estimated for each piece of candidates’ work using the Rasch logistic model to analyse the judges’ decisions. Placing the pieces of work on a measurement scale gives them a rank order. The adaptive nature of ACJ lies in the pairing of essays for each judge. The selection of essays is based on a maximum distance between the quality parameter estimates, allowing useful information to be gained from each paired comparison. This paper reports a study in which ACJ was used to rank order a random sample of 564 essays on a topic in physical geography based on the judgements of a group of 23 teachers and examiners. The reliability of the rank order was 0.97. Evidence is presented for the need for judges to be teaching at the same qualification level as they are judging at. There is a discussion of the factors that need to be addressed before implementing ACJ in summative assessment.",,,,,Rasch model; Machine learning; Logistic regression; Summative assessment; Artificial intelligence; Psychology; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Paired comparison,,,,,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment/summary https://research.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-obtain-highly-reliable-rank-order-summative-assessment/summary,,,2146695179,,0,017-738-075-028-728; 020-492-282-615-504; 040-643-417-873-73X; 048-091-210-665-560; 053-383-650-919-670; 055-671-696-900-616; 061-869-815-688-55X; 062-826-283-401-218; 107-790-959-417-375; 130-744-301-692-166; 139-343-106-919-900; 199-665-658-004-010,12

However, up to now the emphasis in digital tools making use of CJ has lied primarily on efficient algorithms for CJ rather than on providing valuable feedback. Digital Platform for the Assessment of Competences (D-PAC) investigates the opportunities and constraints of CJ-based feedback and aims to examine the potential of CJ-based feedback for learning. Reporting on design based research, this paper describes the features of D-PAC feedback available at different user levels: the user being assessed (assesse), the user assessing others (assessor) and the user who coordinates the assessment (Performance Assessment Manager (PAM)). Interviews conducted with different users in diverse organizations show that both the characteristics of D-PAC feedback and the acceptance at user level is promising for future use of D-PAC. Despite that further investigations are needed with regard to the contribution of D-PAC feedback for user learning, the characteristics and user acceptance of D-PAC feedback are promising to enlarge the summative scope of CJ to formative assessment and professionalization.",653,,23,38,Competence (human resources); Rubric; Summative assessment; Psychology; Judgement; Design-based research; Professionalization; Formative assessment; Knowledge management; Criticism,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8567947 https://core.ac.uk/display/159328657 https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-57744-9_3 https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,,10.1007/978-3-319-57744-9_3,2565206676,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 004-540-449-114-589; 009-631-573-859-890; 022-834-501-395-725; 034-259-628-733-602; 035-776-610-863-582; 035-991-030-021-460; 048-091-210-665-560; 049-970-916-129-791; 055-292-929-125-017; 056-808-669-498-642; 059-303-990-732-701; 068-124-584-046-362; 072-618-043-534-026; 083-798-790-671-139; 087-174-854-393-001; 087-991-691-200-809; 090-593-846-802-324; 091-293-280-581-834; 104-175-236-000-695; 121-258-626-550-035; 127-659-660-814-933; 165-708-633-922-222; 182-282-349-748-141; 184-198-628-385-823,2

Farias; Srikanth Jagabathula; Devavrat Shah,"Choice models, which capture popular preferences over objects of interest, play a key role in making decisions whose eventual outcome is impacted by human choice behavior. In most scenarios, the choice model, which can effectively be viewed as a distribution over permutations, must be learned from observed data. The observed data, in turn, may frequently be viewed as (partial, noisy) information about marginals of this distribution over permutations. As such, the search for an appropriate choice model boils down to learning a distribution over permutations that is (near-)consistent with observed information about this distribution. In this work, we pursue a non-parametric approach which seeks to learn a choice model (i.e. a distribution over permutations) with sparsest possible support, and consistent with observed data. We assume that the data observed consists of noisy information pertaining to the marginals of the choice model we seek to learn. We establish that any choice model admits a ‘very’ sparse approximation in the sense that there exists a choice model whose support is small relative to the dimension of the observed data and whose marginals approximately agree with the observed marginal information. We further show that under, what we dub, ‘signature’ conditions, such a sparse approximation can be found in a computationally efficiently fashion relative to a brute force approach. An empirical study using the American Psychological Association election data-set suggests that our approach manages to unearth useful structural properties of the underlying choice model using the sparse approximation found. Our results further suggest that the signature condition is a potential alternative to the recently popularized Restricted Null Space condition for efficient recovery of sparse models.",,,1,28,Machine learning; Empirical research; Sparse approximation; Existential quantification; Permutation; Artificial intelligence; Brute force; Computer science; Theoretical computer science; Correlation and dependence; Kernel (linear algebra),,,,,http://dspace.mit.edu/handle/1721.1/87680 http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/lpdocs/epic03/wrapper.htm?arnumber=6310952 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ciss/ciss2012.html#FariasJS12 http://dspace.mit.edu/bitstream/handle/1721.1/87680/Farias_Sparse%20choice.pdf;sequence=1 http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.ieee-000006310952 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/78052943.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1109/ciss.2012.6310952,,10.1109/ciss.2012.6310952,2009623462,,1,000-590-328-964-720; 003-738-524-524-439; 014-494-954-863-554; 016-540-243-110-297; 021-526-803-476-474; 022-610-192-660-448; 023-436-952-259-389; 023-828-528-665-292; 025-932-262-178-907; 030-317-991-035-013; 032-669-393-671-230; 035-599-508-241-440; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-739-811-452-544; 040-890-416-074-862; 042-627-416-303-850; 044-086-265-298-647; 047-164-545-895-518; 047-477-392-351-487; 048-841-740-735-490; 051-587-456-232-156; 052-217-341-775-087; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-310-338-398-932; 061-756-851-864-046; 066-081-139-618-975; 067-126-500-360-171; 067-671-311-398-860; 069-074-796-890-155; 070-707-122-430-593; 075-388-391-815-80X; 080-508-247-127-118; 081-154-384-693-571; 083-231-400-366-060; 088-185-235-230-617; 092-474-419-202-077; 092-625-511-839-412; 093-472-739-539-696; 095-720-759-868-465; 097-816-365-068-78X; 105-723-055-057-642; 107-618-423-188-100; 107-884-711-391-615; 111-278-931-243-790; 111-439-749-074-665; 114-961-494-660-531; 120-979-769-133-240; 124-783-387-855-855; 127-067-549-501-438; 129-870-899-398-886; 134-262-828-600-508; 136-013-623-806-110; 145-069-531-384-730; 148-356-412-062-000; 156-940-185-306-556; 167-961-295-053-862; 183-818-686-203-950; 188-040-619-588-181,11

PVIC includes two dimensions of teacher quality that are essential in effective inclusive classrooms: (positive) teacher-student interactions (TSI) and differentiated instruction (DI). It is the first study to measure pre-service teachers' professional vision through a holistic video-based approach using comparative judgement. The validity framework of Chan (2014) was used to investigate construct validity. The results show that the instrument is reliable and valid, and recommendations for use in teacher education programs are formulated.",78,,1,14,Mathematics education; Psychology; Judgement; Teacher quality; Teacher education; Differentiated instruction; Professional vision; Video based; Pre service; Construct validity,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8589320 https://researchportal.vub.be/en/publications/measuring-pre-service-teachers-professional-vision-of-inclusive-c https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0742051X17319029,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.tate.2018.10.007,,10.1016/j.tate.2018.10.007,2901525450,,0,000-929-046-417-833; 001-714-066-034-037; 002-905-657-437-565; 003-287-668-745-978; 004-945-538-115-570; 005-925-916-359-467; 007-598-909-438-594; 009-148-822-033-388; 011-241-688-325-045; 011-937-542-833-86X; 012-840-615-642-032; 012-958-859-280-019; 013-149-886-595-274; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 021-738-595-719-412; 025-665-159-830-801; 028-865-938-331-126; 030-619-394-339-83X; 032-113-282-979-159; 035-252-631-779-112; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-520-088-075-527; 043-993-488-611-488; 046-490-056-981-615; 048-091-210-665-560; 049-524-645-690-658; 050-425-399-628-403; 052-848-508-420-626; 055-107-955-109-70X; 056-563-709-689-951; 059-758-238-344-736; 071-809-501-292-753; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-077-835-572-411; 082-680-397-981-747; 085-875-046-483-200; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-700-017-944-128; 092-288-591-718-930; 095-150-040-596-903; 095-657-301-323-712; 100-436-172-024-424; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-129-919-880-081; 107-790-959-417-375; 108-423-149-640-462; 114-351-272-718-20X; 115-102-354-884-075; 116-953-447-460-185; 118-658-396-717-120; 119-731-133-007-623; 122-847-411-153-253; 125-461-692-288-257; 125-901-333-223-044; 126-292-923-823-985; 126-343-747-393-337; 126-454-221-798-016; 127-659-660-814-933; 129-702-057-302-275; 130-415-818-517-363; 132-784-070-412-495; 135-089-625-164-101; 139-622-437-687-499; 150-891-689-911-083; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 157-800-327-306-757; 161-429-636-038-814; 163-948-804-835-589; 168-945-049-079-238; 174-190-853-832-547; 183-864-225-064-73X; 184-019-762-919-05X; 191-708-787-140-461; 192-090-612-568-882,12

While representation of decision processes, design, judicial ownership, the apparent neutrality of data, and 'choice' are all crucial to allaying judicial concern about embracing technological support, it is suggested here that the deepest concern lies in the judicial discourse of 'balance' between formal and substantive visions of justice. Outlining the development of aggregate decision support systems, the article considers the case of New South Wales, which has the longest established judicial decision support system. Revealing a marked judicial ambivalence either to endorse officially, or, to dismiss that system the paper asks whether this ambivalence is simply a symptom of a deeper malaise, namely a 'jurisprudential incoherence' in judicial decisionmaking. Examining the notion of 'jurisprudential incoherence' in judicial thought and behaviour, the article reveals that the ass...",14,3,297,316,Judicial opinion; Decision support system; Vision; Ambivalence; Judicial discretion; Political science; Law; Penology; Neutrality; Judicial activism,,,,,https://pure.strath.ac.uk/portal/files/4841239/Resolute_Ambivalence_IRLCT2000Tata.pdf http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/713673373 https://pureportal.strath.ac.uk/en/publications/resolute-ambivalence-why-judiciaries-do-not-instititionalise-thei https://strathprints.strath.ac.uk/29513/ https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/713673373,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/713673373,,10.1080/713673373,2169301143,,0,002-018-546-052-688; 002-818-812-343-564; 009-594-063-752-313; 013-913-254-855-913; 016-522-203-073-621; 017-517-584-723-981; 019-779-898-581-296; 022-247-222-650-15X; 023-118-021-870-207; 025-525-455-991-998; 027-758-842-307-738; 028-230-082-227-102; 031-688-084-083-176; 031-752-126-650-815; 032-451-221-791-517; 034-720-276-499-666; 038-458-722-430-066; 039-033-422-991-948; 039-476-291-824-877; 039-760-938-724-411; 041-279-902-414-164; 042-404-546-733-72X; 042-590-933-047-588; 052-537-480-048-659; 057-388-154-588-399; 069-943-398-745-771; 073-913-119-120-910; 082-236-679-852-23X; 086-922-688-607-186; 088-707-436-703-025; 090-030-348-958-546; 090-091-460-642-364; 091-473-244-475-08X; 092-867-433-493-816; 094-141-171-647-706; 096-698-651-042-387; 107-292-500-344-350; 109-407-059-691-377; 113-098-680-720-250; 120-988-975-377-611; 121-376-088-054-591; 130-555-949-318-684; 134-473-287-349-938; 136-765-997-354-827; 136-869-639-852-259; 140-132-629-007-754; 143-141-362-033-139; 144-028-806-895-402; 147-913-953-931-275; 148-372-100-102-595; 152-794-214-727-555,13

The purpose of this study is to demonstrate that comparative judgements predict a unique percentage of job insecurity’s variance, above self esteem. Subsequently, questionnaires were applied via social media or via paper-pencil to 108 participants. Hierarchical regression results show that comparative judgements do not have any incremental effect in predicting job insecurity above self esteem. Self esteem predicts 21% variance in job insecurity. In conclusion, job insecurity is predicted by how individuals globally evaluate themselves, with comparative judgements regarding one’s own performance or the company’s performance having no incremental predictive power.

Holmes; Michelle Meadows; Ian Stockford; Qingping He,"The relationship of expected and actual difficulty of items on six mathematics question papers designed for 16-year olds in England was investigated through paired comparison using experts and testing with students. A variant of the Rasch model was applied to the comparison data to establish a scale of expected difficulty. In testing, the papers were taken by 2933 students using an equivalent-groups design, allowing the actual difficulty of the items to be placed on the same measurement scale. It was found that the expected difficulty derived using the comparative judgement approach and the actual difficulty derived from the test data was reasonably strongly correlated. This suggests that comparative judgement may be an effective way to investigate the comparability of difficulty of examinations. The approach could potentially be used as a proxy for pretesting high-stakes tests in situations where pretesting is not feasible due to reasons of security or other risks.",18,4,366,391,Rasch model; Proxy (climate); Test data; Cognitive psychology; Comparability; Item response theory; Judgement; Paired comparison; Evaluation methods,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1198321 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,,10.1080/15305058.2018.1486316,2891521597,,0,002-124-246-117-231; 003-252-151-417-621; 003-756-524-500-524; 004-656-836-558-125; 006-459-131-027-623; 007-487-157-236-890; 008-272-852-765-741; 009-316-589-031-043; 009-668-473-434-827; 015-364-781-321-626; 016-233-940-623-506; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 023-450-650-144-536; 026-231-463-187-310; 032-888-074-486-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-218-666-884-410; 041-137-753-798-868; 046-429-021-202-877; 046-976-766-132-212; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-859-954-579-45X; 049-032-798-379-237; 051-492-788-553-405; 058-800-324-964-616; 063-863-517-456-537; 064-309-466-938-920; 066-908-670-161-319; 076-050-960-166-845; 080-973-114-262-707; 085-782-124-158-049; 087-991-691-200-809; 089-688-011-210-466; 095-560-048-909-507; 098-071-220-057-302; 131-808-466-646-551; 133-007-911-062-160; 139-442-876-580-978; 159-396-515-847-543; 164-779-008-985-991; 167-648-089-068-325; 177-832-080-912-190; 180-630-843-478-058; 192-571-358-345-962,0

Both were capable of comprehending a range of sentences, even when adequate comprehension was dependent upon the processing of order-dependent syntactic information rather than the utilization of semantic knowledge. Thus they performed satisfactorily on tests using plausibly reversible subject and object constituents with either active or passive verb phrases or prepositional phrases. Both, however, were impaired on sentences which departed from normal conversational conventions in terms of their reference to the order of event occurrence, or to the subject and object of an array. They were also very poor at performing comparative judgements, even when these involved a simple intrinsic attribute such as colour. These findings are discussed in terms of the role of auditory verbal short-term memory in backing up and back-tracking over spoken information when conditions preclude the immediate understanding of auditory-verbal information.",110 ( Pt 6),,1565,1578,,,"Adult; Aphasia/psychology; Humans; Judgment; Language; Language Tests; Male; Memory, Short-Term/physiology; Middle Aged",,,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3427401,3427401,,,,0,,2

During at least 3 weeks each time, the patient received prednisone, then underwent 9 plasmaphereses, and was given guanidine-hydrochloride (HCl) and 3,4-diaminopyridine (3,4-DAP). The muscle-power scoring, muscle function tests and the electrophysiological parameters showed a superiority of 3,4-DAP over the other pharmacological therapies. Good results were also obtained with plasmapheresis. Corticoid medication proved to be less effective. No improvement was seen with guanidine-HCl. For comparative judgement, two months after beginning the last therapy, the patient and the attending physician were questioned with regard to subjective therapeutic success.

Sometimes, these criteria are also illustrated with examples of varying quality. It is, however, not yet clear how students learn from shared criteria and examples. This research aims to investigate the learning effects of two different instructional approaches: applying criteria to examples and comparative judgment. International business students were instructed to write a five-paragraph essay, preceded by a 30-minutes peer assessment in which they evaluated the quality of a range of example essays. Half of the students evaluated the quality of the example essays using a list of teacher-designed criteria (criteria condition; n = 20), the other group evaluated by pairwise comparisons (comparative judgment condition; n = 20). Students were also requested to provide peer feedback. Results show that the instructional approach influenced the kind of aspects students commented on when giving feedback. Students in the comparative judgment condition provided relatively more feedback on higher order aspects such as the content and structure of the text than students in the criteria condition. This was only the case for improvement feedback; for feedback on strengths there were no significant differences. Positive effects of comparative judgment on students’ own writing performance were only moderate and non-significant in this small sample. Although the transfer effects were inconclusive, this study nevertheless shows that comparative judgment can be as powerful as applying criteria to examples. Comparative judgement inherently activates students to engage with exemplars at a higher textual level and enables students to evaluate more example essays by comparison than by criteria. Further research is needed on the long-term and indirect effects of comparative judgment, as it might influence students’ conceptualization of writing, without directly improving their writing performance.",3,,1,12,Learning effect; Higher education; Mathematics education; Psychology; Pairwise comparison; International business; Judgement; Peer feedback; Peer assessment; Conceptualization,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://research.vu.nl/en/publications/applying-criteria-to-examples-or-learning-by-comparison-effects-o https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086/full https://www.narcis.nl/publication/RecordID/oai%3Aresearch.vu.nl%3Apublications%2F34bf345d-5323-4288-832a-f76368337787 https://www.frontiersin.org/article/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086/full,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/feduc.2018.00086,,10.3389/feduc.2018.00086,2897965084,,0,000-541-169-360-063; 001-833-620-542-031; 007-787-338-181-694; 009-111-724-205-749; 009-631-573-859-890; 010-705-107-103-839; 013-366-379-871-159; 018-269-445-638-29X; 018-354-004-761-571; 019-103-887-475-092; 022-445-591-735-121; 027-929-273-054-526; 032-327-336-882-576; 035-262-149-415-846; 035-966-099-589-64X; 040-971-330-680-09X; 041-533-041-196-02X; 043-128-207-906-620; 044-162-761-248-982; 046-154-535-777-571; 046-885-708-774-897; 048-151-229-726-003; 051-876-238-561-753; 057-487-318-922-175; 066-282-838-915-419; 069-107-065-440-634; 072-639-263-099-663; 081-216-031-693-913; 082-101-427-004-332; 084-473-726-538-190; 105-060-972-080-52X; 105-862-038-017-905; 109-350-109-491-919; 112-619-585-716-733; 117-430-862-104-149; 144-247-536-712-847; 149-208-961-050-864; 165-708-633-922-222; 179-937-702-643-938; 183-657-441-981-020,6

P. Sutcliffe,Abstract Some aspects of rank ordering and scaling with paired comparisons data are examined. In terms of the mathematical concept “relation” the characterizing features of a “simple ordering” are set out to make explicit those properties which must be exhibited by paired comparisons data if the objects compared are to be rank orderable. Rank ordering is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for scaling. Cases arise where ordered elements are not scalable by Thurstone's procedures. It is argued that the Law of Comparative Judgement is only one of a number of possible scaling models for paired comparisons data; and an alternative is proposed which relates scale distance to the relative incidence of “error” in comparative judgement.,16,2,137,149,Statistics; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Judgement; Relative incidence; Scaling,,,,,https://api.wiley.com/onlinelibrary/tdm/v1/articles/10.1080%2F00049536408255512 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1080/00049536408255512/abstract http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00049536408255512?queryID=%24%7BresultBean.queryID%7D,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00049536408255512,,10.1080/00049536408255512,1980434223,,0,013-626-322-915-702; 016-926-000-460-104; 039-398-667-161-194; 039-572-150-857-456; 049-346-291-768-075; 065-610-564-040-451; 072-470-410-274-388; 073-761-754-481-07X; 074-069-533-445-505; 091-666-780-893-50X; 127-067-549-501-438,3

A field study has been carried out where 33 subjects drove a Volvo 142 and a Saab 99 in both original condition and with certain degradations in steering and wheel suspension. The cars were driven on a test track where the drivers were exposed to two different types of surprise situations where they had to make quick avoidance manoeurvres. The cars were equipped with instruments for the registration of speed, lateral acceleration, and steering wheel movements. After having driven the cars, the drivers made a comparative judgement of the handling characteristics of the cars. The test method used in this study is evaluated and a comparison is made with other methods for testing vehicle characteristics. Based upon the results from the study and from previous studies, a judgement is made regarding the effects of free play in steering and suspension on vehicle handling and traffic safety. Consequently, some general recommendations are given for the judgement of degradations in steering and suspension components in technical inspections of vehicles. /TRRL/",,,,,Acceleration; Engineering; Test method; Automobile handling; Automotive engineering; Suspension (vehicle); Vehicle inspection; Judgement; Steering wheel; Emergency situations; Simulation,,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view/54963,https://trid.trb.org/view/54963,,,606630946,,0,,0

Pictorial material was contrasted with verbal material. Congruent and incongruent study and test conditions were realized. Subjects had to encode six-term series with size as the relevant dimension. They were tested by a comparative judgement task after a five-second retention interval. Experiment 1 and 2 showed a distinct picture superiority effect with the presentation of pictorial test stimuli. Study modality did not affect the response times. In addition, the test modality effect and the ordinal distance effect proved to be additive. A third experiment was set up to demonstrate the test modality effect with a forced choice recognition task. Although the recognition task did not involve a dimensional comparison, a distinct test modality effect emerged, indicating that access to dimensional information is not the decisive variable for the pattern of results obtained in the first two experiments.

In the academic literature, several vaccination advocates argue that the evaluation frame for vaccines should be expanded to give a more complete picture of their benefits. We seek to contribute to the debate and facilitate informed dialogue about vaccine assessment using visualization, as able to support both deliberation by technical committees about the substance of evaluation and communication of the underlying rationale to non-expert stakeholders. Methods We present two visualizations, an Individual Risk Plot (IRP) and a Population Impact Plot (PIP), both showing the beneficiary population on one axis and the degree of individual benefit and cost of an individual dose on the second axis. We sketch out such graphs for ten vaccines belonging to the UK routine childhood immunization schedule and present our own analysis for the rotavirus and meningitis B vaccines. Results While the IRPs help classify diseases by morbidity and mortality, the PIPs display the health and economic loss averted after introducing a vaccine, allowing further comparisons.

Such comparative formats can reduce the impact of numerous response biases often affecting single-stimulus items (aka rating or Likert scales). However, if scored with traditional methodology, MFC instruments produce ipsative data, whereby all individuals have a common total test score. Ipsative scoring distorts individual profiles (it is impossible to achieve all high or all low scale scores), construct validity (covariances between scales must sum to zero), criterion-related validity (validity coefficients must sum to zero), and reliability estimates. We argue that these problems are caused by inadequate scoring of forced-choice items and advocate the use of item response theory (IRT) models based on an appropriate response process for comparative data, such as Thurstone’s law of comparative judgment. We show that when Thurstonian IRT modeling is applied (Brown & Maydeu-Olivares, 2011), even existing forcedchoice questionnaires with challenging features can be scored adequately and that the IRT-estimated scores are free from the problems of ipsative data.",18,1,36,52,Statistics; Test validity; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Psychology; Psychological testing; Law of comparative judgment; Item response theory; Construct validity; Ipsative; Test score,,"Humans; Models, Psychological; Psychometrics/standards; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires/standards",,Catalan Government; Spanish Ministry of Education,http://europepmc.org/abstract/MED/23148475 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1004409 http://core.ac.uk/display/10635630 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23148475 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/30530/ http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/a0030641 http://www.ub.edu/gdne/documents/ipsative_data.pdf https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2012-30275-001 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/30530/1/Brown%20&%20Maydeu-Olivares%202012%20PsychMethods%20Post-print%20self-archive.pdf https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/10635630.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/a0030641,23148475,10.1037/a0030641,2168767193,,0,000-213-931-311-544; 003-234-442-173-306; 004-414-436-917-174; 005-944-986-860-875; 010-637-180-131-244; 011-325-175-516-004; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-605-981-755-950; 015-241-838-192-918; 016-926-000-460-104; 017-504-153-087-087; 018-093-885-932-859; 022-134-763-599-43X; 022-784-190-934-417; 024-217-408-708-554; 026-111-756-873-764; 029-291-085-676-195; 032-171-661-043-68X; 035-586-436-180-18X; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-806-031-318-759; 038-325-928-190-468; 040-542-869-705-443; 042-262-850-601-237; 042-645-459-184-264; 043-209-749-101-784; 046-039-497-858-085; 046-455-312-385-676; 047-296-035-913-231; 048-058-555-109-207; 058-462-621-956-920; 065-130-290-645-468; 072-527-793-787-571; 079-743-335-576-735; 080-379-244-700-11X; 090-460-864-082-122; 095-269-978-788-939; 102-693-982-590-25X; 119-063-668-084-122; 123-600-993-524-166; 137-683-385-733-057; 158-473-971-253-175; 164-779-008-985-991; 184-163-882-210-658,95

Recent work on linguistic accent emphasizes the role of accent in person perception and social categorization, demonstrating that accent serves as a mean- ingful ethnic category indicator. In this paper, we examine whether accent can be used to implement socio-cultural mark- ers. We investigate whether the accent of a virtual character, as a marker for culture, can cause cultural frame-shifts in indi- viduals. We report an experiment, performed among bicultural and monocultural individuals, in which we test the above hy- pothesis. Our results show that accent can have a socio-cultural effect on people’s cognition. Keywords: accent, culture, frame-switching, biculturalism Introduction There is a substantial amount of research focusing on the in- fluence of language on human cognition. Language, at its core, is a cognitive tool that helps us construct shared mean- ings, categorize our knowledge, and thus piece together the various associative networks of collective experiences to form our perception of the world around us. According to the Whorfian hypothesis (Whorf, 1956), the grammar of a lan- guage and the manner in which the language is processed can provide a glance into the implicit organization of knowledge in that culture. This inherent influence is reflected in the be- lief that the grammatical structure of a language shapes our interactions due to the speakers inherent exposure to certain observations and mental representations, otherwise known as the principle of linguistic relativity (Chiu, Leung, & Kwan, The results from previous studies with bilingual partici- pants support the use of language as a means of activating as- sociated cultural constructs. For instance, Chinese bilinguals randomly assigned to respond in Chinese reported more col- lective self-statements in open-ended self-descriptions, lower self-esteem, and more agreement with Chinese cultural views (Ross, Xun, & Wilson, 2002). These qualities are in line with traits commonly associated with Eastern collectivist cul- tures. The findings also suggest that cultural identities may be stored in separate knowledge structures and activated by the associated language. Marian and Neisser (2000) exam- ined the retrieval of autobiographical memories in bicultural individuals and found that memories become more accessi- ble when the language used at retrieval matched the language used at encoding. In other words, Russian-English bilin- guals were able to remember more events from the Russian- speaking period of their lives when they responded in Rus- sian and more experiences from the English-speaking period of their lives when they responded in English. In their meta-analysis of cross-cultural studies of self- enhancement, Heine and Hamamura (2007) point out the lim- itations and confounds in existing research regarding whether language can independently prime a cultural mindframe. Lee, Oyserman, and Bond (2010) attended to these short- comings in their study by exploring the effect of experi- mentally manipulated language use on value endorsements and self-descriptions. By unobtrusively manipulating lan- guage as a prime, they found that bilingual participants ran- domly assigned to use English reported significantly more self-enhancing social comparative judgements than those us- ing Chinese. In addition, English users demonstrated more social distancing after under-performance and standardized their failure in the context of the behavior of their peers in order to protect their positive self-regard. This is in line with the expected behavior of someone from an individualist culture and touches on the work done by Tesser (2000) and Kwan et al. (2004) regarding the mechanisms employed to protect, augment, or maintain self-esteem.The above findings also support the claim that societies are socialized for both in- dividual and collective mindsets, but responses are dependent on the cultural mindset salient at the moment of self-reflection (Lee et al., 2010). This literature demonstrates the cognitive implications of experimentally manipulating language as a prime to prompt a shift in an individuals cultural mindset. The findings from these studies support the use of language as a marker for cul- ture, however, in this paper we aim tease apart the specific aspects of language that act as cultural markers, e.g., by ma- nipulating accents. Ethnolinguistic identity theory indicates that language plays a crucial role in the formation and cate- gorization of one’s ethnic identity (Giles, Bourhis, & Taylor, 1977). Rakiˇc, Steffens, and Mummendey (2011a) compared the strength of vocal accents compared to facial visual ap- pearance as indicators for ethnic categorization. They found that not only did accent serve as a meaningful ethnic cate- gory indicator, but participants also overlooked visual stim- uli, such as facial features typically associated with a culture, in the presence of this more meaningful auditory information (Rakiˇc et al., 2011a). In other words, sociopsychological pro- cesses were a more salient tool in determining memorability than objective stimulus features. In a later study, they exam- ined the effect of accent workplace context. Job applicants with a standard German accent were compared to those with",34,34,,,Linguistic relativity; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Grammar; Perception; Linguistics; Cultural identity; Individualistic culture; Categorization; Mental representation; Social identity theory,,,,,http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0263/paper0263.pdf https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/cogsci/cogsci2012.html#DehghaniKHNG12 https://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Using%20Accent%20to%20Induce%20Cultural%20Frame-Switching.pdf http://ict.usc.edu/pubs/Using%20Accent%20to%20Induce%20Cultural%20Frame-Switching.pdf https://escholarship.org/uc/item/90g319qn,http://mindmodeling.org/cogsci2012/papers/0263/paper0263.pdf,,,2286349487,,0,003-933-146-303-551; 011-530-275-028-393; 014-160-848-959-86X; 016-340-644-214-859; 018-132-949-884-614; 020-862-850-475-489; 025-746-241-548-033; 031-269-053-619-277; 036-924-763-509-021; 043-889-701-041-067; 048-098-575-575-615; 050-372-423-421-837; 052-139-209-303-970; 055-660-215-232-829; 064-496-464-534-443; 076-686-361-385-53X; 088-774-087-845-841; 100-762-767-533-563; 101-345-378-673-836; 101-538-031-128-397; 132-339-387-273-715; 149-769-552-778-213; 175-570-011-713-075; 179-615-961-217-819,2

There are a number of reports on the highly reliable rank orders achieved using ACJ. However, none of these reports addresses the validity of the criteria on which judges base their decisions. The reliability of the rank ordering of 564 AS-level geography essays by 23 teachers or examiners of geography was reported previously. The judges in this study were asked to use their professional judgement when making decisions about essays; they were not provided with mark schemes or assessment objectives, but two importance statements were made available to them. After each judgement (92.4% of the total), the judges in this empirical study made notes about what was to the forefront of their minds when they made a decision between two essays. The investigation reported here uses thematic analysis of these notes to identify and test the validity of the criteria the judges used to make their decisions. On the whole the judges used the language of the mark scheme and the assessment objectives when describing the knowledge demonstrated in the essays. They used language from these two sources to a lesser extent when describing skills, but nonetheless indirect links could be established between the content of the notes and existing documents. These links demonstrate the use of existing shared criteria by the judges, thus the validity of the criteria used by judges in their decision-making was confirmed. However, these criteria are already established as part of examiner training, marking and teacher support. This has implications for the introduction of ACJ as a replacement for marking, which are discussed.",,,,,Trait; Empirical research; Psychology; Adaptive comparative judgement; Judgement; Teacher support; Professional judgement; Thematic analysis; Applied psychology; Social psychology,,,,,https://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method https://research.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method http://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method,http://cerp.aqa.org.uk/research-library/testing-validity-judgements-using-adaptive-comparative-judgement-method,,,1918381019,,0,008-690-892-911-290; 017-792-980-099-478; 020-492-282-615-504; 025-677-136-905-020; 030-159-505-970-284; 037-550-015-414-716; 048-091-210-665-560; 062-826-283-401-218; 076-789-172-721-292; 084-568-415-452-121; 089-686-651-949-112; 091-187-114-869-104; 112-375-692-314-045; 148-976-132-772-558; 158-650-875-509-18X; 170-760-456-367-609,3

R. Alcantud; Ritxar Arlegi,"This paper contributes to the axiomatization of additive rules for ranking sets of objects under the psychological principle of categorization. Firstly we proceed with the case where the elements in the sets are categorized into at most three groups, namely good (with value 1), neutral (with value 0), and bad (with value-1). Secondly, we solve the case where there are only good and neutral elements. In both instances the evaluation of the sets is purely additive. Lastly, we show that dropping one of the axioms in our general characterization produces an axiomatization of the more general class of evaluations where good and bad elements are weighted differently.

Mardcus-Roberts,"Abstract We study two types of sequences of positive integers which arise from problems in the measurement of comparative judgements of probability. The first type consists of the Van Lier sequences, which are nondecreasing sequences x 1 , x 2 ,…, x n of positive integers that start with two 1's and have the property that, whenever j k ≤ n , x k − x j can be expressed as a sum of terms from the sequence other than x j . The second type consists of the regular sequences, which are nondecreasing sequences of positive integers that start with two 1's and have the property that each subsequent term is a partial sum of preceding terms. We show that every regular sequence without “gaps” is Van Lier and that every regular sequence which satisfies the Fibonacci-like inequality x k ≤ x k -2 + x k -1 is Van Lier. We also study one-term extensions of Van Lier sequences and obtain some asymptotic results on the number of Van Lier sequences.",27,3,209,220,Combinatorics; Measure (mathematics); Regular sequence; Mathematics; Integer,,,,,https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-218X(90)90066-L https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X9090066L http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0166218X9090066L https://doi.org/10.1016/0166-218X(90)90066-L https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/dam/dam27.html#FishburnRM90 https://researchwith.montclair.edu/en/publications/van-lier-sequences https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82068965.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0166-218x(90)90066-l,,10.1016/0166-218x(90)90066-l,2039480157,,0,000-847-142-844-959; 052-334-477-235-517; 061-814-205-393-617; 068-796-265-924-174; 079-171-387-446-747; 089-809-518-243-329; 130-335-142-114-934; 145-925-293-683-338; 174-899-267-664-657,5

To do this, this approach introduces a Uniform Progress and Evaluation Reporting System (UPERS), which is capable of rendering comparative judgements across various agency performances. Some of the highlights of comparative inquiry made through the UPERS are: 1) the degree to which theoretical involvement justifies one's program; 2) the degree to which the program is fully developed to accommodate consistent replications of the program; 3) the degree of discrepancy between the target population and clients who are actually served by the program; and 4) the degree to which evaluation is implemented by the program agency toward an enhancement of one's existing program or toward a development of a valid and more useful program in the future.",12,4,309,323,Psychiatry; Abuse prevention; Program monitoring; Fully developed; Alcohol and drug; Reporting system; Target population; Substance abuse; Medical education; Program evaluation; Medicine,,,,,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.2190/ERG9-H63H-A9EL-A4LP https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ274002,http://dx.doi.org/10.2190/erg9-h63h-a9el-a4lp,,10.2190/erg9-h63h-a9el-a4lp,1994425479,,0,013-788-620-236-347; 022-925-860-167-306; 097-838-531-180-185; 172-107-452-867-13X,0

Recent research, however, shows that standard inequality theory cannot be applied to ordinal data (Zheng Res. Econ.

A pairwise comparison process is used to help individual decision makers make comparative judgements, and a linguistic rating method is used for making absolute judgements. A hierarchical weighting method is developed to assess the weights of a large number of evaluation criteria by pairwise comparisons. To reflect the inherent imprecision of subjective judgements, individual assessments are aggregated as a group assessment using triangular fuzzy numbers. To obtain a cardinal preference value for each decision alternative, a new fuzzy MCDM algorithm is developed by extending the concept of the degree of optimality to incorporate criteria weights in the distance measurement.

In a large sample of professionals (N=1,185), we found in support of our hypotheses that the generalized strategy of optimization was linked to the domain-specific strategy of career planning, and that domain-specific career planning was directly linked to all outcome measures. The generalized strategy of optimization was directly linked to subjective success, but only indirectly to objective success. The link from self-management to subjective success was independent of objective success.

It was found that proximities between risks based on similarity judgements are easily interpretable in terms of a tree representation. The resulting clusters are mostly composed of homogeneous risks. They differed from clusters based on absolute judgements, which are composed of risks of a more diverse character. The results of a multidimensional scaling analysis of absolute judgement data are easily interpretable in terms of three abstract dimensions: size of a potential catastrophe, familiarity, and probability, whereas for comparative judgement data one of the two dimensions found was concerned with the nature of the risk rather than with abstract risk characteristics. Finally, we found that verbal protocols of both similarity and absolute judgemental tasks yield the same risk characteristics as used in the psychometric paradigm. The only difference between the two tasks is that in the similarity sorting tasks almost twice as many statements as in the Q-sorting task are related to the nature of the hazardous event. This supports the claim by Slovic et al.

Rousseau; Snehal A. Tijoriwala,"This article addresses the state-of-the-art of assessment methodologies in the study of psychological contracts. Three types of assessment have been employed in research using a psychological contracts framework. Content measures focus upon the terms of the psychological contract individuals are party to. Feature measures assess the attributes of the psychological contract itself including explicit/implicit and static/dynamic, and at present are a relatively undeveloped form of assessment contract. Evaluation measures are the comparative judgements individuals make in the context of their psychological contract, including the degree to which it has been fulfilled or violated. Implications for future research are described, along with the advantages of both quantitative and qualitative assessments.

Karylowski; Karolina Szutkiewicz-Szekalska; Marzena Cypryańska,"Studies on direct comparative judgments typically show that, for items that are positively evaluated, a single item randomly drawn from a larger set of similar items tends to be judged as better than average (the BTA effect). However, Windschitl, Conybeare, and Krizan (2008) demonstrated that, under timing conditions that do not favor focusing attention on the single item, the reversal of the BTA effect occurs. We report two experiments showing that the magnitude of the reversed BTA effect increases as a function of the size of a multiitem referent with which a single item target is compared. Specifically, in direct comparative judgments of the attractiveness of positively evaluated objects (nice-looking cloth buttons, attractive buildings, or cupcakes), underestimation of the attractiveness of singletons, as compared with a multiitem set (reversed BTA effect), increased with the increased set size. Analysis of absolute judgments obtained for singletons and for small and large multiitem sets suggests that, for attractive stimuli, both the reversed BTA effect in comparative judgments and its sensitivity to set size occur as a result of a positive relationship between set size and perceived attractiveness in absolute judgments.",42,4,639,647,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Referent; Focusing attention; Positive relationship; Single item; Better than average; Attractiveness; Illusory superiority; Social psychology,,Adult; Female; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Visual Perception/physiology; Young Adult,,,https://paperity.org/p/35140365/reversed-better-than-average-effect-in-direct-comparisons-of-nonsocial-stimuli-depends-on https://pubpeer.com/publications/00A3CD0187CB37B37DA2E5FC2EB55A https://core.ac.uk/display/81171691 https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24352697 https://rd.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7 https://www.questia.com/library/journal/1P3-3333111211/reversed-better-than-average-effect-in-direct-comparisons https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7 http://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4024155 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/81171691.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7,24352697,10.3758/s13421-013-0385-7,2098768241,PMC4024155,0,003-258-105-238-013; 012-419-306-168-454; 018-051-287-827-615; 020-681-086-245-158; 020-696-840-914-301; 021-016-667-776-519; 032-104-735-088-638; 039-044-601-310-689; 058-598-386-910-561; 064-393-430-166-126; 064-990-488-097-173; 071-386-606-831-934; 076-726-072-796-619; 078-077-264-622-029; 080-287-610-251-548; 082-662-120-833-072; 084-421-364-199-245; 091-622-417-034-204; 108-227-936-150-296; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-762-136-028-844; 172-243-671-352-087; 181-166-614-027-51X,0

However, a majority of the developing world’s population will soon be post-transitional - what will happen then? This paper attempts to outline where answers to this question might be found. It suggests that a valuable way to organise the study of these issues is the concept of the demographic regime. Objective: The aim of the paper is to encourage discussion on the nature of post-transitional demographic regimes around the world, especially in the developing world. The style of the reflection is that of a speculative essay - a Denkstűck or ballon d’essai. Methods: In addition to a discussion of the concept of a demographic regime, the paper looks at three possible sources of information on the determinants of post-transitional regimes in the developing world: 1) the nature of the transition itself, 2) lessons drawn from pre-transitional regimes, and 3) demographic trends in Europe and other developed countries, some which have been post-transitional for several decades. Conclusions: The paper concludes with a set of suggestions for future research on the topic.",28,46,1373,1388,Demographic transition; Developed country; Political science; Population; Demographic economics; Development economics; Fertility; Developing country,,,,,https://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol28/46/28-46.pdf https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:dem:demres:v:28:y:2013:i:46 https://ideas.repec.org/a/dem/demres/v28y2013i46.html http://www.demographic-research.org/volumes/vol28/46/ https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/handle/10023/5010 https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/handle/10023/5010/Wilson_2013_DR_Thinking.pdf;sequence=1 https://research-repository.st-andrews.ac.uk/bitstream/10023/5010/1/Wilson_2013_DR_Thinking.pdf https://dx.doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,http://dx.doi.org/10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,,10.4054/demres.2013.28.46,2158813199,,0,000-190-109-807-44X; 002-380-390-359-940; 003-050-004-828-88X; 005-259-479-306-954; 005-368-779-787-975; 006-646-403-584-380; 007-121-286-539-314; 010-658-274-187-735; 014-199-643-603-358; 019-143-648-364-447; 029-632-482-574-793; 030-911-347-269-339; 033-179-893-156-598; 036-171-334-217-22X; 044-023-222-494-236; 049-027-850-844-321; 049-400-030-468-888; 052-882-684-156-771; 053-648-056-971-530; 053-861-602-003-696; 054-561-741-828-497; 065-144-802-334-864; 068-277-570-821-986; 072-265-962-874-530; 076-902-643-095-382; 083-105-943-964-545; 086-036-451-633-662; 102-524-930-280-252; 112-484-885-897-438; 115-509-162-289-911; 122-388-324-120-795; 127-534-718-607-496; 138-741-587-171-653; 148-393-890-656-762; 168-371-035-815-249; 172-034-065-460-87X; 180-639-417-844-351; 181-168-240-756-660; 182-194-287-848-20X; 191-276-371-939-273; 194-818-031-191-820,10

Previous studies of facial symmetry detection have used front views of faces where the decision could be made on 2D image properties rather than 3D facial properties. These studies also employed comparative judgements, which could be influenced by attractiveness rather than symmetry. Two experiments explored the ability to detect typical levels of 3D facial asymmetry (contrasted with wholly symmetrical faces) from 2D projections of faces. Experiment 1 showed that asymmetry detection was impaired by inversion but even more impaired by 90 degrees rotation demonstrating the importance of the vertical reflection. Asymmetry detection was also reduced by yaw rotation of the head but still above-chance at 30 degrees rotation. Experiment 2 explored the effect of asymmetrical lighting and yaw rotation up to 45 degrees. Detection of asymmetry was affected by asymmetrical lighting and yaw rotation in a non-additive manner. The results are discussed in terms of the special role that faces and vertical symmetry play in visual perception.",9,10,243,,Artificial intelligence; Facial symmetry; Visual perception; Yaw; Perception; Image properties; Evolutionary significance; Attractiveness; Computer vision; Asymmetry; Computer science,,,,,https://doaj.org/article/557bce23014d4bf8bcff81bdf087b152 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/symmetry/symmetry9.html#Lewis17 http://orca.cf.ac.uk/105793/ https://doi.org/10.3390/sym9100243 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/243/pdf https://core.ac.uk/display/120131965 https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/9/10/243/htm,http://dx.doi.org/10.3390/sym9100243,,10.3390/sym9100243,2766301423,,0,000-344-701-320-71X; 003-715-744-671-180; 006-334-457-608-402; 007-191-161-760-617; 009-329-227-862-539; 010-419-347-919-709; 011-180-672-203-32X; 012-989-027-745-911; 013-978-636-141-278; 015-396-217-117-604; 018-717-256-906-255; 021-795-202-147-945; 024-831-706-940-984; 025-466-559-704-669; 026-196-385-155-83X; 026-443-346-821-284; 027-727-088-316-672; 029-938-349-681-102; 032-175-635-090-35X; 032-799-454-429-903; 037-218-545-135-146; 038-229-126-373-65X; 039-803-540-678-272; 044-049-628-521-308; 045-447-773-101-81X; 046-627-664-777-815; 052-366-430-773-066; 055-087-156-656-461; 058-676-739-798-896; 058-915-209-988-786; 060-348-522-596-467; 066-140-731-426-777; 066-217-650-604-861; 067-530-864-213-011; 067-872-041-138-065; 067-977-495-673-08X; 071-166-027-221-635; 095-095-401-840-950; 097-591-314-335-329; 104-953-574-480-714; 109-065-312-226-210; 110-544-385-561-208; 131-154-104-703-838; 139-241-958-305-012; 140-289-367-706-840; 154-287-098-770-121; 181-703-420-251-418,2

The results were correlated with reproductive values for male and female British Columbians and for !Kung Bushwomen. Grief ratings were more highly correlated with reproductive value than with age and more highly correlated with reproductive values of !King Bushwomen than with those of British Columbians. The correlations were higher for male- than for female-stimulus children. The correlations of female ratings with reproductive value were higher than male ratings with reproductive value, although not as high as expected.

Any support from the citizens?",,2017,journal article,"Economics: The Open-Access, Open-Assessment E-Journal",18646042,Walter de Gruyter GmbH,Germany,Francesco Farina; Roberto Tamborini,"The 'Five Presidents Report' cited in the title acknowledges that an important driver of the European economic crisis has been the faulty original design of the Monetary Union, and that substantial steps are urgently needed towards the creation of truly supranational institutions. Yet, economists tend to neglect that however compelling economic analyses may be, the stumbling block on the way of the reform of the Monetary Union is political will, and that in democracies the ultimate source of political will comes from electors. In this paper, first of all the authors wish to bring to the economists' attention some recent analyses of citizens' attitudes towards Europe from political science. Then, by cross-referencing the results of the 2014 elections of the European Parliament with Eurobarometer opinion polls eliciting judgements for the EU vis-a-vis home countries and an indicator of economic pain, the authors show the presence of a geo-economic-political cleavage across four groups of countries. This is more complex, and perhaps worse, than the simplistic divide between 'North' and 'South' or 'Core' and 'Periphery'. The main implication is that the EU experiences a stalemate between 'more Europe vs. less Europe' at the level of peoples, which seriously undermines support for further integration 'from below'.",11,,1,26,Stalemate; Political economy; Economics; European integration; Economic and monetary union; Neglect; Eurobarometer; Parliament; Development economics; Politics,,,,,http://www.economics-ejournal.org/economics/journalarticles/2017-10 https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:zbw:ifweej:201710 https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/157632 https://ideas.repec.org/a/zbw/ifweej/201710.html https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/93362106.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-10,,10.5018/economics-ejournal.ja.2017-10,2565305691,,0,,0

091-879-828-401-973,Proficiency tests in forensic science: A step towards identifying expertise,2011-10-12,2011,,,,,,Jane Sexton,"Forensic examiners have been publicly rebuked for implausible explanations and inconsistent practice and yet, are frequently called to testify about forensic evidence in criminal cases. There is a growing sense of urgency to quantify the ability of examiners before they appear in court as expert witnesses. Perception, judgement and the ability to discriminate between complex patterns are common themes of many forensic disciplines. Building upon the fingerprint expertise research of Tangen, et al. (2011), this thesis explains how a similar framework can be developed into a proficiency paradigm and applied to all forensic evidence that requires comparative judgements. Given the increased use of photographs as court evidence and for verifying identity across society, the experiment in this study is a proficiency test of facial recognition. Recognising unfamiliar faces is challenging and people frequently make errors on matching tasks, even in optimal conditions (Megreya & Burton, 2006). Minimal scientific data exists about the range of ability in face recognition and we tested fifty-three novices (psychology students) to establish baseline performance. Twenty-seven surveillance camera operators were nominated as experts for this experiment, based on their daily exposure to faces and photographs. Group comparisons found no significant difference in overall discrimination accuracy. Additional analysis suggests the benefit of expertise may overcome the own-race effect. Within the novice group, accurate identification of own and other-race faces differed between Asian and Caucasian students. Exposure to different races seems to improve discrimination accuracy for other-race faces.",,,,,Forensic science; Psychology; Cognitive psychology; Fingerprint; Perception; Judgement; Daily exposure; Proficiency test; Group comparison; Facial recognition system; Social psychology,,,,,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:276346,https://espace.library.uq.edu.au/view/UQ:276346,,,115159807,,0,,0

However, job applicants may intentionally distort their answers when filling in these questionnaires, undermining the validity of the test results. Forced-choice questionnaires are allegedly more resistant to intentional distortion compared to graded-scale questionnaires, but they generate ipsative data. Ipsativity violates the assumptions of classical test theory, distorting the reliability and construct validity of the scales, and producing interdependencies among the scores. This limitation is overcome in the current study by using the recently developed Thurstonian item response theory model. As online testing in job selection contexts is increasing, the focus will be on the impact of intentional distortion on personality questionnaire data collected online. The present study intends to examine the effect of three different variables on intentional distortion: (a) test format (graded-scale versus forced-choice); (b) culture, as data will be collected in three countries differing in their attitudes toward intentional distortion (the United Kingdom, Serbia, and Turkey); and (c) cognitive ability, as a possible predictor of the ability to choose the more desirable responses. Furthermore, we aim to integrate the findings using a comprehensive model of intentional distortion. In the discussion, three main aspects are considered: (a) the limitations of the manipulation, theoretical approach, and analyses employed; (b) practical implications for job selection and for personality assessment in a broader sense; and (c) suggestions for further research.",7,,933,933,Two-alternative forced choice; Classical test theory; Psychology; Personality Assessment Inventory; Personality; Item response theory; Personnel selection; Construct validity; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Ipsative,Thurstonian IRT; cross-cultural comparison; faking; forced-choice; ipsativity; personality assessment; personnel selection,,,,https://repositorio.uam.es/handle/10486/679163 https://europepmc.org/articles/PMC4923072 https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933/full https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4923072 https://philpapers.org/rec/VANSPO-9 http://journal.frontiersin.org/Article/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933/abstract https://core.ac.uk/display/95690568 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82839473.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933,27445902,10.3389/fpsyg.2016.00933,2462278078,PMC4923072,0,000-489-528-822-456; 002-015-407-196-776; 003-825-878-021-084; 004-414-436-917-174; 012-250-676-081-224; 012-605-981-755-950; 012-627-916-329-389; 013-306-690-012-539; 020-618-031-109-608; 025-137-591-276-791; 027-954-386-742-59X; 031-194-283-622-830; 032-333-847-164-155; 032-348-734-542-617; 032-941-579-903-79X; 033-378-414-090-811; 033-541-341-859-841; 035-153-660-708-045; 035-586-436-180-18X; 035-776-610-863-582; 038-738-796-330-259; 050-864-145-452-633; 051-516-927-252-789; 055-878-986-170-728; 059-537-641-635-286; 060-533-748-155-140; 065-130-290-645-468; 068-887-024-059-785; 076-748-273-080-884; 079-646-550-056-48X; 079-743-335-576-735; 080-035-626-923-950; 080-749-654-385-947; 083-144-220-481-779; 089-730-755-743-093; 099-704-199-194-794; 105-306-992-739-667; 108-947-815-597-716; 111-563-008-275-644; 113-184-123-590-319; 130-958-189-347-349; 137-842-266-409-786; 160-868-949-777-94X; 168-563-911-365-679,4

The current study examines the basic number representations that allow individuals to perform higher-level arithmetical procedures. These representations are normally present in the earliest stages of development, but they may be affected by cultural, developmental, and educational factors. Deaf and hearing participants were asked to perform two number comparison tasks. Analysis of response times revealed that all participants showed effects normally associated with representation of magnitude on a visual-analog mental number line: SNARC, distance, and size effects. However, deaf participants were slower overall in making comparative judgements, suggesting that whilst their numerical representation does not differ from that of hearing individuals, the efficiency with which they process basic numerical information is lower. The results are discussed in terms of interactions between biologically determined numerical representations and cultural and schooling factors that differentially affect deaf and hearing individuals.",15,3,223,236,Erikson's stages of psychosocial development; Developmental psychology; Psychology; Cognition; Task analysis; Cognitive psychology; Number representation; Mental number line; Mathematical ability; Cultural influence,,,,,https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ698077 https://abdn.pure.elsevier.com/en/publications/snarc-hunting-examining-number-representation-in-deaf-students https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1041608005000142,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.lindif.2005.01.004,,10.1016/j.lindif.2005.01.004,2070028566,,0,000-495-638-642-502; 002-093-118-383-755; 003-626-441-665-213; 005-725-817-996-691; 007-396-120-137-676; 008-750-609-169-097; 009-848-557-018-765; 010-187-743-570-895; 011-109-503-221-760; 012-126-563-786-633; 012-386-984-787-272; 012-888-856-322-905; 015-012-693-948-294; 015-932-952-551-526; 016-227-375-936-145; 018-843-349-234-58X; 019-971-667-171-45X; 021-527-667-379-059; 024-074-817-864-157; 027-025-577-655-193; 027-052-718-619-027; 027-686-653-711-512; 029-915-293-337-721; 031-541-539-785-70X; 032-318-802-530-902; 034-459-270-159-517; 036-133-195-355-501; 036-693-275-000-730; 039-569-462-353-364; 045-946-516-220-881; 049-092-751-377-693; 051-472-129-782-759; 052-264-047-560-423; 053-914-696-508-092; 054-461-279-321-072; 058-101-541-281-341; 060-192-954-093-945; 060-551-132-182-852; 060-778-427-738-113; 064-352-210-500-873; 065-301-737-906-059; 066-857-532-351-66X; 067-280-694-341-045; 070-633-946-680-713; 080-294-391-171-462; 081-689-136-042-922; 082-567-920-386-21X; 084-421-364-199-245; 086-214-041-467-250; 086-922-926-484-143; 088-849-249-876-733; 092-272-102-076-652; 095-635-258-346-689; 096-970-737-166-540; 108-164-445-874-825; 110-796-036-243-296; 120-204-913-104-353; 129-827-356-327-594; 138-281-982-150-380; 151-362-529-354-487; 151-895-257-464-093; 155-534-200-752-360; 166-222-949-803-699; 167-388-826-583-987; 172-456-113-290-327; 177-015-691-281-199; 184-994-768-086-419; 186-479-589-178-971,36

One reason is that conceptual understanding is better assessed using open-ended test questions that invite an unpredictable variety of responses that are difficult to mark.

We applied this technique to the peer assessment of calculus on a first-year mathematics module. We explored the reliability and criterion validity of the outcomes using psychometric methods and a survey of participants.

By Mixed Nested Logit model we mean the model which combines the mixed logit with the nested logit estimated simultaneously. Results reveal the presence of both correlation (addressed by the nested logit model) and different taste heterogeneity (addressed by the mixed logit model). The estimation results for the combined mixed nested logit model is presented compared with individual estimation results for nested logit on its own, mixed logit on its own and multinomial logit. This paper is unique in that there does not seem to be much work in using this combined mixed nested logit model approach to understanding long distance travellers’ behaviour in the context of road pricing. This paper opens up this area for investigation and shows the additional explanation we can potentially achieve to improve our models forecasting ability.",1,1,24,35,Multinomial logistic regression; Logit; Econometrics; Economics; Willingness to pay; Road pricing; Toll; Toll road; Ordered probit; Mixed logit,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146514000052 https://core.ac.uk/display/82061475 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352146514000052 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82061475.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.trpro.2014.07.004,,10.1016/j.trpro.2014.07.004,2021232259,,0,004-955-765-542-299; 008-159-370-919-678; 009-725-759-362-345; 010-809-633-087-177; 012-065-370-685-872; 022-530-311-151-815; 025-271-819-261-797; 026-298-384-101-255; 028-871-247-313-798; 029-135-457-418-636; 030-159-884-660-285; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-100-112-870-141; 037-539-711-063-369; 037-748-719-206-441; 042-627-416-303-850; 042-751-741-052-90X; 052-115-081-225-099; 052-217-341-775-087; 053-198-154-681-152; 057-657-809-679-383; 069-078-163-183-58X; 072-298-723-280-04X; 075-725-207-748-825; 082-428-789-334-720; 089-329-720-515-073; 091-326-683-097-72X; 107-789-313-226-600; 124-628-909-501-502; 125-977-799-521-773; 128-315-979-589-27X; 135-607-100-530-655; 152-774-271-995-988; 176-983-121-289-473; 180-508-588-026-935; 184-845-311-102-387,3

In an attempt to speed up measurements and quantitative evaluations, a single image frequency was selected for those measurements on a photoelectric contrast-transfer optical bench. Comparisons were made of MTF curves obtained for a group of lenses, and comparisons were also made of subjectively judged photographic color transparencies and enlarged prints of black-and-white negatives taken with these lenses. When the MTFs and the relative rankings were correlated, it was found that an image frequency of 30 lines (or cycles) per millimeter yields good comparative judgements and good discrimination among the lenses tested. Similar correlations were tried for MTF values at 15 and 45 lines per mm. It was observed that better correlation is obtained when picture rankings and measured contrast at 30 lines per mm are used. When combined with resolving power obtained from measurements of fine-grained black-and-white negative film, a consistent and repeatable relative evaluation is achieved.",0237,,512,515,View camera; Millimeter; Photography; Optics; Angular resolution; Microlens; Lens (optics); Still camera; Mathematics; Science of photography,,,,,https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/237/0000/Single-Image-Frequency-Measurements-Of-Camera-Lenses/10.1117/12.959122.full https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1980SPIE..237..512S/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1117/12.959122,,10.1117/12.959122,158543795,,0,,1

For z ϵ C we call the matrix M + zE xy an elementary matrix perturbation of M . Let Λ be any eigenvalue of M . Then there exists an ( x, y ) pair, 1 ⩽ x , y ⩽ n , and an analytic function h xy (z) defined in a neighborhood N of the origin such that: (a) h xy (0) = Λ . (b) h xy (z) is an eigenvalue of the elementary matrix perturbation M + z k ( Λ ) E xy for any z ϵ N , where k (Λ) is the dimension of the largest block containing Λ in the Jordan canonical form of M . (c) For any z ϵ N , z ≠ 0, M + zE xy has k (Λ) distinct eigenvalues, all different from Λ. If Λ( z ) is any one of these, then |Λ − λ(z)| = O(|z| 1 k (Λ) ) . (d) For any z ϵ N , z ≠ 0, M + zE xy has eigenvalue Λ with multiplicity s ( Λ ) − k ( Λ ), where s (Λ) is the (algebraic) multiplicity of Λ in M .

Flynn; Elisabeth Huynh; Timothy J. Peters; Hareth Al-Janabi; Sam Clemens; Alison Moody; Joanna Coast,"This paper reports the results of a best–worst scaling (BWS) study to value the Investigating Choice Experiments Capability Measure for Adults (ICECAP-A), a new capability measure among adults, in a UK setting. A main effects plan plus its foldover was used to estimate weights for each of the four levels of all five attributes. The BWS study was administered to 413 randomly sampled individuals, together with sociodemographic and other questions. Scale-adjusted latent class analyses identified two preference and two (variance) scale classes. Ability to characterize preference and scale heterogeneity was limited, but data quality was good, and the final model exhibited a high pseudo-r-squared. After adjusting for heterogeneity, a population tariff was estimated. This showed that ‘attachment’ and ‘stability’ each account for around 22% of the space, and ‘autonomy’, ‘achievement’ and ‘enjoyment’ account for around 18% each.

Having defined these two dimensions, we then present the results of a research program conducted to explore the relationship between them. In general, using both experimental and correlational data, we find evidence of a compensation effect between the two dimensions when two targets are compared. That is, when one target is judged more positively on one of the two fundamental dimensions, the second is judged more positively on the other dimension. We show that this compensation effect is confined to these two fundamental dimensions rather than something that more broadly characterises comparative judgements on any two judgemental dimensions.

This was part of the wider ‘e-scape’ project (2003-present), which has developed an innovative controlled alternative to design & technology and science public assessment at age 16. Teachers from eight primary schools were trained in the use of an online task-authoring tool to develop and trial assessment activities based on current classroom work. To compile their e-portfolios of assessment evidence, pupils used netbook devices, which afford multi-modal responses (text, drawing, photo, audio, video, spreadsheet) whilst leaving space on pupils’ tables for practical investigations. Once the pupil e-portfolios had been uploaded to the secure e-scape website, teachers assessed them using a ‘comparative judgement’ approach to produce a rank order with a high reliability coefficient. Participant teachers recognised the strength of the e-scape approach in terms of facilitating and managing pupils’ responses to assessment tasks in the classroom, which they successfully adapted to suit primary pedagogy. In particular, the benefits of scaffolding complex assessment tasks through the step-wise e-scape process in the authoring tool represented for some of the teachers a pedagogically significant development in terms of their planning.",22,2,247,263,The Internet; Mathematics education; Educational technology; Mobile device; Educational assessment; Judgement; Portfolio; Computer science; Science education; Technology education,,,,,https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3/fulltext.html https://www.learntechlib.org/p/64590/ http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/498/ http://researchspace.bathspa.ac.uk/498/1/davies%202012%20assessing%20scientific.pdf https://researchportal.bath.ac.uk/en/publications/assessing-scientific-and-technological-enquiry-skills-at-age-11-u https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ963413 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs10798-011-9191-3 https://repository.cardiffmet.ac.uk/handle/10369/7313,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3,,10.1007/s10798-011-9191-3,2059030851,,0,002-576-201-501-958; 025-414-450-614-761; 033-185-038-160-466; 034-312-023-741-108; 040-635-579-446-765; 048-311-956-478-536; 080-656-755-453-432; 080-906-522-591-809; 096-660-556-373-774; 098-490-797-549-316; 099-532-206-198-323; 100-687-607-260-140; 103-853-896-798-421; 116-038-810-712-270; 118-281-689-077-414; 131-973-822-467-47X; 134-827-860-297-188; 139-343-106-919-900; 147-739-525-098-407; 151-694-829-780-796; 164-791-656-742-519; 173-768-298-331-939,8

Special attention is given to linear constraints; and to equality constraints, where any of the parameters may be assumed to be known in advance and any subset of the parameters may be assumed to take on either a specified or an unspecified common value.

These student theses should together represent 30 ECTS. One common way to implement this requirement is that the student writes two theses, where the first one is a systematic review of earlier research and the second one a more traditional empirical thesis. This article investigates if this new type of student thesis – that is, systematic reviews written by students as the first part of the requirements for teacher qualification, also involves a new kind of assessment practice for the examiners at the teacher education programmes. In the student thesis the student is supposed to demonstrate skills concerning several formal learning aims of the teacher education to obtain their qualifications. These include to follow the development of knowledge within a field and solve problems. The student thesis is not only important for the individual student to obtain qualifications, but has also been used to evaluate the teacher education programmes. Despite its significance for students and schools of education, very little research has been conducted on practices in the assessment of systematic reviews. Earlier research related to assessment of student theses demonstrates the difficulties with agreement in assessment practice. The results from earlier studies regarding the importance of the examiners’ background present a divided picture. While some research point to the examiners’ own subject or experience as important when judging theses, other studies do not.The purpose with this study was to examine if a systematic review, as a new phenomenon at the teacher education programmes, has entailed a new assessment practice for the examiners at the universities. Supervisors and examiners at six universities with teacher education have been interviewed and have also answered a survey concerning these systematic reviews. The interviews were conducted through a combination of comparative judgement and repertory grid technique. The interviews were conducted after the respondents had read 5-8 student theses. In the interviews, criteria which were pointed out as decisive for the quality of a thesis by the respondents were discussed. The survey was a Q-sort survey where the respondents ranked different assessment criteria. A total of 45 criteria from the interviews were ranked from 0-10 by the respondents with respect to how important they are when judging a student thesis.The results demonstrate a width in the assessment repertoire among the respondents. Examiners in the study do not see notable differences between a systematic review and a more traditional student thesis. The reasoning concerning criteria was mostly made on a relatively general level, which could be applied both to systematic reviews and empirical theses. Only 27 per cent of the respondents in the survey set a criterion which was more important for a systematic review. Those differences which were mentioned related to the structure of the thesis, the method and how the relation to research is described. Results suggest that examiners’ assessment criteria is a potentially important area for educational development within schools of education, and would also deserve attention in wider national and international discussions.",24,1,25,45,Psychology; Systematic review; Ranking; Formal learning; Repertory grid; Judgement; Teacher education; General level; Phenomenon; Medical education,,,,,http://www.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:1297442,http://dx.doi.org/10.15626/pfs24.1.03,,10.15626/pfs24.1.03,2942983431,,0,,0

This experimental design is based on Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgement. To facilitate consistency in presentation of stimuli, collection of data, and computation of psychological scale values, an X-windows testing environment has been developed called the X-based Perceptual Experiment Testbed (XPET). A pilot study was conducted utilizing this experimental design. The study utilized images in which targets and their associated background had uncorrelated Gaussian noise texture patterns. Thus, only first- order image statistics were of significance. Psychological scale values for `target distinctness' obtained using this experimental design were compared to several first-order image metrics. Correlation coefficients as high as 0.9881 were found between the psychological scale values and first-order image metrics. It has been concluded that this experimental design should be adequate for data collection to support development of new second-order image metrics.© (1995) COPYRIGHT SPIE--The International Society for Optical Engineering.

110-642-930-710-491,De comparatieve beoordelingsmethode voor een betrouwbare en valide cv-screening : Een vergelijking tussen experts en studenten,,2019,journal article,Gedrag & Organisatie,09215077,,,Anneleen Mortier; Renske Brouwer; Liesje Coertjens; Ellen Volckaert; Amelie Vrijdags; Roos Van Gasse; Peter Vlerick; Sven De Maeyer,"ENGLISH: In practice and in earlier empirical research, it is indicated that resume screening does not always provide suitable candidates for a vacancy. This might be due to several issues: one assessor carries out the screening, resulting in cognitive distortions influencing the selection process; the assessment does not focus on all aspects of the selection, nor does it allow for certain criteria to weigh more heavily than others; and/or the assessor is insufficiently trained to carry out the resume screening. The current study captures these issues by offering an alternative assessment method (Comparative Judgment) in which the interrater reliability and construct validity of the resume screening is studied: several assessors with different levels of expertise assess resumes comparatively. In this study, resumes from 42 candidates applying for an existing vacancy were used. These resumes were directly compared by experienced (N = 7; experts), and less experienced assessors (N = 57; students). Results show that the comparative judgements of experienced assessors are linked to valid and reliable resume screening. The inter-rater reliability of the student assessments was lower than that of the experts. Even though the final rank ordering of the resumes correlated, students often relied on irrelevant aspects in the resumes. NEDERLANDS: In de praktijk en uit eerder empirisch onderzoek blijkt dat cv-screening niet altijd zorgt voor geschikte kandidaten voor een vacature. Verschillende zaken kunnen hiervan de oorzaak zijn: een beoordelaar voert de screening uit, waardoor cognitieve vertekeningen het selectieproces kunnen beinvloeden; de beoordeling focust niet op alle relevante aspecten van de selectie of laat bepaalde criteria harder doorwegen dan andere; en/of de beoordelaar heeft onvoldoende expertise om de cv-screening uit te voeren. De huidige studie komt aan deze tekortkomingen tegemoet door de alternatieve beoordelingsmethode, comparatieve vergelijking, te beschrijven en de interbeoordelaarsbetrouwbaarheid en constructvaliditeit ervan voor cv-screening na te gaan. In deze studie is gebruikgemaakt van een bestaande vacature waarvoor 42 kandidaten hun cv hebben ingestuurd. Deze cv's zijn comparatief met elkaar vergeleken door ervaren (experts; N = 7) en minder ervaren beoordelaars (studenten; N = 57).

The glue between confirmation and truth approximation appears to be the instrumentalist methodology, rather than the falsificationist one.; By evaluating theories separately and comparatively in terms of their successes and; problems (hence even if they are already falsified), the instrumentalist methodology provides - both in theory and in practice - the straight route for short-term empirical progress in science in the spirit of Laudan. However, it is argued that such progress is also functional for all kinds of truth approximation: observational, referential, and theoretical. This sheds new light on the long-term dynamic of science and hence on the relation between the main epistemological positions, viz., instrumentalism (Toulmin, Laudan), constructive empiricism (van Fraassen), referential realism (Hacking and Cartwright), and theory realism of a nonessentialist nature (Popper), here called constructive realism.; In From Instrumentalism to Constructive Realism (2000) the above story is presented in great detail.

Iverson,"Abstract Thurstonian psychophysics is re-examined from the viewpoint of a theory of “random comparisons” which generalize the notion of “discriminal differences.” The assumption of normality which appears so crucial to all varieties of Thurstone models is not invoked but becomes a consequence of our theory—at least this is so under independence assumptions similar to those employed in conventional derivations of Case III models. If nothing else, the theoretical scheme developed in this work clarifies the status of Thurstone's assumption of normality, placing it in the deeper probabilistic context of stability . Under reasonable side assumptions we are also able to arrive at satisfactory conclusions as to the uniqueness of the scales (i.e., mean and standard deviation) which appear in Case III of the Law of Comparative Judgement.",31,3,219,247,Thurstonian model; Econometrics; Psychophysics; Thurstone scale; Standard deviation; Normality; Judgement; Uniqueness; Mathematics; Probabilistic logic,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022249687900289 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022249687900289,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0022-2496(87)90028-9,,10.1016/0022-2496(87)90028-9,2039186506,,0,018-695-880-236-529; 026-363-879-651-740; 033-935-624-332-793; 035-776-610-863-582; 043-789-932-617-475; 058-310-338-398-932; 062-546-879-061-051; 064-280-410-708-601; 069-630-020-342-076; 069-850-827-841-209; 071-110-982-489-792; 082-083-748-173-982; 118-835-184-901-473; 121-161-560-636-803; 121-378-214-742-205; 137-947-968-725-768; 182-664-322-815-248,14

114-833-564-450-569,Comparative Judgment-based feedback versus the traditional approach: similarities and differences,,2016,,,,,,Anneleen Mortier; Marije Lesterhuis; Peter Vlerick; Sven De Maeyer,"Traditionally, assessing and feedbacking students’ tasks are mostly done one task at a time (= classic method). This method allows educators to give comments in the text (= classic feedback). However, given the rise of an alternative assessment method (Comparative Judgement - CJ), in which two tasks are compared with each other, the question arises if this method is perceived as easy to provide feedback. Additionally, comparing this method to the classic method, the question also arises how CJ-based feedback differs from the classic method in content. Therefore, this study tried to fill this gap, studying both assessment methods, using quantitative and qualitative measures. CJ is an assessment method where multiple assessors compare two tasks and decide each time which of those two demonstrates the best performance of the given competence (Pollitt, 2012). These tasks are ranked on a scale relatively to each other from worst to best performance (Bramley, 2007). Previous research demonstrates superior reliability and validity over the classic method (Lesterhuis et al., 2015; Pollitt, 2012). Also, CJ-based feedback is perceived as reliable, honest and relevant (Mortier, Lesterhuis, Vlerick, & De Maeyer, 2015). Nevertheless, this feedback has not been investigated in relation to alternative assessment methods. Given this, our study investigated the following research questions:; 1. Does CJ-based assessment lends itself more to give feedback to assessees, according to assessors, in comparison to the classic assessment method?; 2. How is the content of CJ-based feedback different from classic generated feedback?; ; Method; Eleven second year students (= assessors) in the Dutch teacher training program graded and feedbacked letters from 12 first year students in the Dutch teacher training program. Assessors feedbacked the letters in the classic way. Additionally, using CJ, they rated the letters and gave feedback expressed as ‘what is good about this letter’ and ‘what needs to be improved’. The assessment order was contra-balanced. Next, they filled out a survey and participated in focus groups.; 8 Developing assessment policy and practice 14.00-15.00 Rolls; ; Results; Results indicated that the CJ-method is perceived as more difficult to give feedback in comparison to the classic method (M=3.5, SD=0.9). Focus groups revealed that assessors in the CJ-condition did not go into micro-detail. However, they appreciated the positive approach in CJ, forcing them to also give positive comments, which they were not inclined to do in the classic method. This was also confirmed by content analysis: (?²(1, N = 4) = 113.91, p<.001, Cramer’s V=.45). Additionally, further analyses revealed that CJ-based feedback was more focused on style, structure and lay-out , while the classic feedback was more focused on spelling, punctuation, and phrasing ((?² (1, N = 13) = 138.23 , p < .001, effect size: Cramer’ V= .48)).; ; Conclusion; This study suggests that the CJ assessment method, in comparison with a traditional assessment method, is perceived by assessors as less easy to provide feedback. Moreover, the content of the feedback differs between both assessment methods. Further research is needed to determine whether CJ-based feedback is perceived by students as more useful in comparison with more classic generated feedback.; ; References; Bramley, T.

Three groups of listeners (speech and language pathologists, primary school;                     teachers and inexperienced listeners) judged 126 utterances of seven normally hearing children, seven children with an acoustic;                     hearing aid and seven children with a cochlear implant, in a comparative judgment task.

Within the group of hearing-impaired children, cochlear implanted children were judged to exhibit;                     higher speech quality than acoustically hearing aided children, especially after a longer device use.

The purpose of this paper is to undertake an in‐depth examination of ethical relativity and ethical absolutism before concluding with a discussion of which research implications warrant further investigation.Design/methodology/approach – A descriptive, historical, anthological approach has been taken.Findings – Ethical relativism is regrettably subject to a proliferation of related terminology and, in many instances with different meanings ascribed to similar terms. In addition, ethical relativity appears to attract different research perspectives that are heavily dependent on their academic origins. A clear distinction needs to be made between ethical and situational relativity. It is suggested that relativism is present in the process of moral justification a...",22,4,446,464,Epistemology; Business ethics; Absolute monarchy; Sociology; Relativism; Law; Warrant; Ethical relativism; Ethical theory; Terminology; Situational ethics,,,,,https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/abs/10.1108/09555341011056203 http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30032187/mcdonald-ethicalrelativism-2010.pdf https://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/full/10.1108/09555341011056203 https://www.emerald.com/insight/content/doi/10.1108/09555341011056203/full/html http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30032187 https://core.ac.uk/display/13989520 http://hdl.handle.net/10536/DRO/DU:30032187,http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/09555341011056203,,10.1108/09555341011056203,1976902777,,0,001-540-270-289-814; 003-321-592-482-96X; 004-301-871-987-213; 004-400-027-618-408; 006-078-820-359-712; 007-494-578-128-746; 008-217-781-651-007; 013-498-256-469-949; 019-122-827-016-998; 021-555-372-372-157; 022-590-694-696-197; 024-180-661-800-809; 025-459-069-408-888; 025-937-518-543-078; 030-647-689-148-49X; 033-515-188-380-076; 034-710-486-485-976; 036-933-696-490-758; 047-069-554-448-300; 050-745-436-075-880; 052-178-703-374-629; 054-787-801-789-47X; 066-276-287-415-459; 069-090-887-536-143; 074-706-132-350-07X; 077-199-497-186-175; 082-109-370-053-630; 083-573-234-461-23X; 091-389-416-127-136; 094-950-844-126-949; 109-979-454-422-621; 121-557-697-069-601; 123-089-916-403-912; 123-980-646-794-791; 125-258-519-327-474; 135-609-325-193-863; 145-354-455-381-484; 150-855-021-395-930; 152-028-653-454-234; 152-135-626-329-239; 168-601-091-634-830; 180-806-867-779-230; 183-434-694-965-995; 194-507-942-252-542,21

The conventional MCDA approach assumes the spatial homogeneity of alternatives within the case study area, although it is often unrealistic. On the other side, GIS provides excellent data acquisition, storage, manipulation and analysis capabilities, but in the case of a value structure analysis this capability is lower. For these reasons, several studies in the last twenty years have given attention to MCDA-GIS integration and to the development of Spatial Decision Support Systems (SDSS). Hitherto, most of these applications are based only on a formal integration between the two approaches. In this paper, we propose a complete MCDA-GIS integration with a plurality of MCDA methodologies, grouped in a suite. More precisely, we considered an open-source GIS (GRASS GIS 6.4) and a modular package including five MCDA modules based on five different methodologies. The methods included are: ELECTRE I, Fuzzy set, REGIME analysis, Analytic Hierarchy Process and Dominance-based Rough Set Approach. Thanks to the modular nature of the package, it is possible to add new methods without modifying the existing structure. To present the suite, we applied each module to the same case study, making comparisons. The strong points of the MCDA-GIS integration we developed are its open-source setting and the user friendly interface, both thanks to GRASS GIS, and the use of raster data. Moreover, our suite is a genuine case of perfect integration, where the spatial nature of criteria is always present.",146,,491,504,Decision support system; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Engineering; Industrial engineering; AM/FM/GIS; Decision analysis; Operations management; Geographic information system; ELECTRE; Enterprise GIS; Analytic hierarchy process,GIS; GIS-MCDA integration; Modular package; Multicriteria analysis; Spatial Decision Support Systems,Agriculture/methods; Decision Support Techniques; Geographic Information Systems; Italy; Software; Soil/chemistry; Waste Water/chemistry,Soil; Waste Water,,https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/en/publications/decision-support-systems-for-environmental-management(a4afec09-c721-4344-aa1e-495a2c121635).html https://core.ac.uk/display/44337503 https://researchportal.port.ac.uk/portal/files/3587797/GRECO_2014_cright_JEM_Decision_Support_Systems_for_environmental_management.pdf https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25217251 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0301479714004150 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/96911444.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.08.012,25217251,10.1016/j.jenvman.2014.08.012,2088390482,,0,000-032-310-152-613; 000-049-774-109-155; 005-028-004-000-718; 007-829-009-877-044; 009-520-084-489-639; 009-731-056-359-941; 009-881-393-198-900; 013-558-194-366-638; 016-222-156-789-082; 019-450-646-323-721; 019-896-301-668-915; 023-717-798-956-450; 027-658-098-723-734; 031-168-518-307-415; 037-505-789-176-616; 039-081-048-503-970; 039-970-993-010-206; 043-941-724-908-466; 044-275-299-608-263; 044-388-174-583-067; 050-435-190-329-575; 051-701-541-652-944; 051-764-724-269-647; 054-042-325-761-209; 054-297-454-062-396; 056-525-608-995-872; 057-873-249-802-836; 057-899-470-719-009; 059-621-625-774-632; 060-294-104-085-524; 062-866-939-598-807; 064-271-728-969-663; 070-518-134-439-20X; 071-274-427-367-121; 073-918-970-797-792; 074-752-562-443-142; 076-397-023-710-589; 077-924-178-869-437; 079-925-407-613-097; 084-244-646-766-522; 087-005-168-992-082; 088-082-540-347-879; 090-743-207-313-533; 092-518-232-011-23X; 094-881-485-482-901; 094-916-258-044-36X; 096-232-935-502-942; 096-556-213-149-623; 102-945-489-185-769; 103-295-534-710-003; 110-401-992-531-715; 113-968-021-053-614; 119-735-713-316-500; 121-543-799-545-35X; 124-821-847-488-721; 125-207-679-674-272; 127-655-403-797-492; 127-899-183-292-505; 130-033-583-833-869; 136-856-541-162-580; 144-081-647-582-70X; 153-020-497-021-110; 153-544-055-666-12X; 159-616-324-894-197; 169-201-939-642-576; 170-098-095-607-115; 189-948-451-028-944; 193-576-286-556-777,42

However, in order to use these ordinal methods to produce health state values for use in cost-effectiveness analysis using cost per quality adjusted life year (QALY) analysis, these values must be anchored on the full health-dead scale. The paper reports on two feasibility studies that use two approaches to anchor health state utility values derived from discrete choice data on the full health-dead scale: normalising using (1) the TTO value of the worst state and (2) the coefficient on the ‘dead’ dummy variable. Health state utility values obtained using rank and discrete choice data are compared to more commonly used TTO utility values for two condition-specific preference-based measures; asthma and overactive bladder. Ordinal methods were found to offer a promising alternative to conventional cardinal methods of standard gamble and TTO.

Wagner,"The objective of a large scale integrated avionics architecture trade study is to consistently and fairly choose among alternative architectures. A structured process is required to accomplish this objective. The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) provides a framework, and was used to quantitatively choose among four potential alternative avionics complement architectures with respect to meeting avionics design objectives and mission needs. This paper focuses on an implementation of the AHP on a large scale integrated launch vehicle avionics systems engineering architecture trade study. Several key characteristics of the four alternative architectures are identified and form the evaluation criteria for the trade study. AHP was used to carefully evaluate the relative importance of the criteria, and aide in the comparative judgements and synthesis of the criteria priorities and the selection of the alternative. The alternative avionics solution selected is a modular, federated (pseudo distributed) architecture of subsystems which results in the most efficient overall launch vehicle management.",9,1,1157,1165,Modular design; Architecture; Engineering; Avionics; Design objective; Reliability engineering; Systems engineering; Avionics architecture; Launch vehicle; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://www.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/j.2334-5837.1999.tb00287.x,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/j.2334-5837.1999.tb00287.x,,10.1002/j.2334-5837.1999.tb00287.x,2123118560,,0,149-830-858-490-132,1

For each digit, the subject decided whether it was smaller or larger than the preceding one. We examined to what extent ERP components are associated with the probability information each digit provides with respect to the subsequent response. Shortest reaction time (RT) and highest accuracy was obtained for the two end terms one and five. The N1 and P2 components of the ERP were attenuated for the two end terms. Three late positivities were found: early P3, P3b, and slow wave. P3b increased in amplitude the more information the eliciting digit provided with respect to the response to the subsequent digit. Moreover, a negative correlation was found between the P3b amplitude associated with information extraction and the RTs to the subsequent digit. During comparative judgement, subjects process the relative position of a stimulus within a stimulus set to extract information about the probability of a forthcoming response, and this process is reflected in P3b amplitude.",31,1,23,28,Stimulus (physiology); Psychology; Cognition; Amplitude; Communication; Electroencephalography; Audiology; Event-related potential; Information processing; P3b; Numerical digit,,Adult; Decision Making/physiology; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials/physiology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Processes/physiology; Reaction Time/physiology,,,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/resolve/doi?DOI=10.1111/j.1469-8986.1994.tb01021.x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8146251 http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1994.tb01021.x/abstract,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.1469-8986.1994.tb01021.x,8146251,10.1111/j.1469-8986.1994.tb01021.x,2028026187,,0,000-296-044-768-210; 001-758-549-422-258; 003-375-024-877-035; 005-292-861-847-705; 009-150-128-242-043; 014-304-423-897-683; 023-261-315-768-293; 033-329-909-068-375; 046-317-093-033-340; 055-894-821-267-433; 057-674-872-908-948; 064-184-142-462-966; 081-855-307-275-175; 088-354-284-237-756; 091-862-297-458-143; 092-038-674-579-284; 107-657-993-517-14X; 137-397-263-804-155; 144-357-353-982-243; 166-688-877-483-052; 199-721-536-781-704,17
119-944-719-393-049,Adaptive comparative judgement: Adapting adaptive assessment to assess the quality of students’ work,,2012,,,,,,Alastair Pollitt; Matt Wingfield,"It is increasingly acknowledged that adaptive assessment has a significant role to play in enhancing the assessment of and for learning. Computer adaptive testing (CAT) is a familiar method of delivering adaptive assessment, but it comes with a number of challenges that make it difficult to deploy, especially its reliance on questions (items) that can be presented and scored on computer, as well as the need for a large bank of items that have all been calibrated on large samples of suitable students. This paper focuses on a new form of adaptive assessment, where the adaptive nature of the approach is the very thing that makes it viable for large scale deployment. Adaptive comparative judgement (ACJ) is based on a historically sound approach developed by L.L. Thurstone in 1927 - the law of comparative judgement. The approach utilises paired comparisons to deliver highly reliable, non-subjective scaled ranking, but in its raw state, it relies on many paired comparisons to achieve a secure ranked result, making it impractical for use as an operational system. Through work carried out over several years, TAG Developments, working with Cambridge expert Alastair Pollitt, has developed a web-based application of Thurstone's law that is underpinned by an innovative adaptive algorithm which can generate a secure, scaled rank order of student work at least as efficiently as traditional marking. In addition, since assessors are not restricted to the types of task that can be marked reliably, they are free to use whatever methods they judge most authentic and valid. The system therefore delivers strong validity and exceptional reliability when compared to traditional criterion referenced assessment methods. In addition to outlining ACJ and its advantages and disadvantages, the paper also provides information on a number of research projects and live/pilot deployments where the approach has been used in an assessment context.",2,2,,,Machine learning; Engineering; Computerized adaptive testing; Thurstone scale; Artificial intelligence; Ranking; Adaptive comparative judgement; Adaptive algorithm; Judgement; Operational system; Criterion-referenced test,,,,,https://ijea.org.uk/index.php/journal/article/view/42,https://ijea.org.uk/index.php/journal/article/view/42,,,2751650050,,0,,0

Sixteen competencies were assessed by peers, bosses and subordinates of 922 managers, as well as self-assessed, using the Inventory of Management Competencies (IMC) administered in two formats – Likert scale and multidimensional forced choice. Likert ratings were subject to strong response biases, making even theoretically unrelated competencies correlate highly. Modeling a latent common method factor, which represented non-uniform distortions similar to those of “ideal-employee” factor in both self- and other assessments, improved validity of competency scores as evidenced by meaningful second-order factor structures, better inter-rater agreement, and better convergent correlations with an external personality measure. Forced-choice rankings modelled with Thurstonian IRT yielded as good construct and convergent validities as the bias-controlled Likert ratings, and slightly better rater agreement. We suggest that the mechanism for these enhancements is finer differentiation between behaviors in comparative judgements, and advocate the operational use of the multidimensional forced-choice response format as an effective bias prevention method.",20,1,121,148,Competence (human resources); Two-alternative forced choice; Likert scale; Psychology; 360-degree feedback; Common method; Personality measurement; Large sample; Social psychology,,,,,https://ore.exeter.ac.uk/repository/handle/10871/31808 http://orm.sagepub.com/content/early/2016/09/14/1094428116668036.abstract?rss=1 http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1094428116668036 http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/811741/ http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1094428116668036 https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1094428116668036 https://kar.kent.ac.uk/56849/ https://core.ac.uk/display/46164657 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76988003.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1177/1094428116668036,,10.1177/1094428116668036,2518837046,,0,003-424-873-906-097; 003-827-323-981-814; 004-414-436-917-174; 005-125-076-444-435; 005-619-715-572-32X; 005-944-986-860-875; 007-937-422-698-646; 009-554-139-359-758; 010-023-219-291-67X; 011-140-195-981-199; 011-704-099-375-309; 012-533-199-430-099; 012-605-981-755-950; 013-250-533-880-180; 016-334-794-759-191; 017-504-153-087-087; 022-874-450-990-810; 027-914-759-250-461; 032-171-661-043-68X; 033-171-354-077-456; 035-776-610-863-582; 039-231-157-137-528; 043-209-749-101-784; 045-467-194-880-837; 049-031-700-146-909; 050-774-931-252-816; 051-103-693-658-229; 053-683-775-278-605; 054-227-285-251-001; 055-534-572-092-062; 062-084-670-744-560; 063-173-731-251-585; 063-340-335-909-221; 065-130-290-645-468; 072-174-081-549-611; 076-133-783-142-378; 079-646-550-056-48X; 082-429-809-925-881; 084-672-021-220-248; 088-302-026-824-355; 089-142-960-937-363; 095-083-647-703-800; 097-637-615-501-803; 100-923-052-964-831; 102-693-982-590-25X; 104-849-049-483-28X; 105-787-802-380-041; 105-947-811-754-818; 106-812-550-778-018; 108-831-924-899-305; 113-184-123-590-319; 116-953-447-460-185; 129-178-025-132-832; 138-919-832-514-732; 151-999-065-318-418; 152-507-665-090-595; 168-102-460-634-312; 181-363-802-296-381; 185-252-489-419-325,15

J. A. Ellis; B. Perrat; J. Goulding,"Finding the deprived areas in any country or city can allow policy makers to design interventions which support citizens in these areas. Locating these areas is often challenging in developing countries where official statistics may not be collected or are unreliable. Comparative judgement models, such as the Bradley--Terry model, offer a solution leveraging local knowledge by comparing different areas based on affluence. Existing comparative judgement methods require a large amount of data to be collected, which can be expensive and time consuming, particularly in developing countries. In this article we develop the Bayesian Spatial Bradley--Terry model, which substantially decreases the amount of data that needs to be collected. We do this by constructing a network representation of the city and incorporating an assumption of spatial smoothness, meaning we can learn about the level of deprivation in one area from neighbouring areas. We demonstrate our method on a novel comparative judgement data set collected in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, where we are able to identify several slums and the level of deprivation of each slum.",,,,,Bayesian probability; Regional science; Official statistics; Geography; Psychological intervention; Judgement; Slum; Tanzania; Bradley–Terry model; Developing country,,,,,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128 https://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14128.pdf https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2020arXiv201014128S/abstract http://arxiv.org/pdf/2010.14128.pdf https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128 https://aps.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128,http://export.arxiv.org/abs/2010.14128,,,3096736113,,0,005-932-334-805-223; 007-730-040-038-468; 009-731-680-573-255; 011-105-391-999-886; 013-056-378-792-578; 014-470-716-101-523; 014-832-499-648-674; 016-178-367-287-757; 018-036-661-212-608; 025-009-658-071-875; 031-947-903-216-926; 032-437-388-057-540; 038-809-435-969-896; 041-656-251-943-572; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-115-902-001-10X; 052-955-411-698-406; 076-720-080-903-106; 079-011-726-795-309; 079-863-114-555-507; 081-370-959-105-221; 087-991-691-200-809; 093-777-263-895-915; 117-309-565-714-034; 120-424-874-837-080; 124-103-129-714-441; 124-850-148-955-311; 168-663-423-050-326; 170-919-478-336-370; 171-083-962-161-997; 175-755-079-554-999,0

The Workshop was motivated, firstly, by the realization that the rapid development of computers, especially microcomputers, will greatly increase the scope and capabilities of computerized decision-support systems. It is important to explore the potential of these systems for use in handling the complex technological, environmental, economic and social problems that face the world today. \ud; \ud; Research in decision-support systems also has another, less tangible but possibly more important, motivation. The development of efficient systems for decision support requires a thorough understanding of the differences between the decision-making processes in different nations and cultures. An  understanding of the different rationales underlying decision making is not only necessary for the development of efficient decision-support systems, but  it is also an important factor in encouraging international understanding and cooperation. \ud; \ud; The Proceedings of the Workshop which are contained in this volume are divided in four main sections. The first section consists of an introductory lecture in which a unifying approach to the use of computers and computerized mathematical models for decision analysis and support is described. The second section is concerned with approaches and concepts in interactive decision analysis and section three is devoted to methods and techniques for decision analysis.

Gilmore; Matthew Inglis,"An impediment to conducting high-quality quantitative research studies in education is the paucity of valid measures of learning gains. Studies often seek to investigate students’ deep, conceptual understanding yet many measures assess only surface, procedural understanding. One reason is that the development of validated measures of conceptual understanding is; resource intensive, time consuming, and success is not guaranteed. We evaluated a novel and efficient technique, based on comparative judgement, for assessing conceptual understanding. We applied the technique to a randomised controlled trial in which students were taught simple algebra based on either the Grid Algebra or the MiGen software package. The; participants were Year 5 students (N = 188) drawn from four primary schools who had not encountered algebra previously. An instrument from the literature (Concepts in Secondary Mathematics and Science: Algebra Scale), and a novel comparative judgement assessment were administered following the intervention. Students in the Grid Algebra condition outperformed those in the MiGen condition on both post-test measures. The comparative judgement technique performed similarly to the standard instrument but was far more efficient to design and implement. The technique can, in principle, be quickly applied to any target concept of interest. We conclude that comparative judgement is a valid, reliable and practical tool that could help to increase both the quantity and quality of quantitative research in education.",45,3,662,680,Mathematics education; Randomized controlled trial; Grid; Judgement; Computer-Assisted Instruction; Research studies; Computer science; Concept learning; Quantitative research; Teaching method,,,,,https://bera-journals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/berj.3519 https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/bitstream/2086/17819/1/unblindedBERJv6.pdf https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_in_randomised_controlled_trials_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9367286 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1217574 https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Measuring_conceptual_understanding_in_randomised_controlled_trials_can_comparative_judgement_help_/9367286 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/berj.3519 https://dora.dmu.ac.uk/handle/2086/17819,http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/berj.3519,,10.1002/berj.3519,2944732768,,0,000-083-173-604-74X; 004-257-050-498-919; 007-327-090-466-145; 008-352-828-586-786; 009-486-832-701-513; 010-184-721-331-793; 014-392-940-528-758; 016-061-342-436-657; 020-097-247-590-604; 021-386-533-570-898; 022-886-709-886-069; 027-043-806-375-152; 028-600-184-401-058; 029-170-231-544-764; 032-908-431-584-353; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-416-173-942-082; 040-322-708-659-111; 048-091-210-665-560; 051-426-516-197-907; 051-492-788-553-405; 055-622-216-898-182; 057-106-898-116-433; 059-996-900-937-514; 061-928-852-602-804; 069-479-016-271-86X; 074-130-298-330-256; 079-204-990-553-617; 089-893-698-644-668; 089-966-641-745-315; 098-234-435-889-919; 103-589-015-928-645; 104-214-513-904-430; 105-937-076-512-724; 123-212-204-814-685; 168-704-895-296-891; 177-072-688-486-223; 177-646-788-839-209; 182-789-160-159-32X,7

Walsh; Federica Pazzaglia; Miranda Eng; Ali Dastmalchian,"Organizational members frequently evaluate how their abilities and standing compare with those of their colleagues. Although these comparisons can have a negative impact on organizations, little attention has been paid to the role of leaders in these processes. Drawing on interviews with individuals in leadership positions in business schools, we develop a framework to explain what triggers leaders' attention to social comparisons among faculty and how they become involved in them. Central to this framework are leaders' self-schemas, which encompass their preferences about the criteria members should use in making comparisons. Leaders' self-schemas are activated by discrepancies between their own comparative judgements and those they perceive members to be making and impel them to act in ways consistent with their preferred bases of comparison.

One of the most well-known psychometric “laws” is Thurstone's Law of Comparative Judgement which is based on the assumption that relative preferences among different criteria (“stimuli”) can be established if the criteria are lined up in pairs. Thurstone was a statistician and his approach requires replicated pairing. Foresters who use replicated pairing correctly assume that there is a population of judgements in a given set of criteria, i.e. that an individual's preferences are usually not consistent. Replicated pairing is, in theory, most desirable, but it can be very time consuming, and is therefore likely to be rejected by management staff. Unreplicated pairing, if used with circumspection and refinement, can be a realistic alternative for obtaining foresters preferences. Examples are presented to demonstrate the method.",139,1,15,20,Pairing; Econometrics; Psychophysics; Thurstone scale; Psychometrics; Judgement; Statistician; Population; Mathematics,,,,,http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00382167.1986.9630052,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00382167.1986.9630052,,10.1080/00382167.1986.9630052,2130686863,,0,006-256-394-981-902; 054-431-645-825-32X; 152-993-729-002-790; 157-722-439-959-321,1

The purpose of the; exploration was to gain new insight into the relatively unknown research area of; instrument development in the areas of small business support. A probability; sampling method, that is a systematic random sampling, was used in the; selection of 60 participants who are small business operators. Sampling was; done from a population frame presented in a directory of small businesses; registered with the Gauteng Chamber of Businesses.; Data collection was done through face-to-face interviews using the developed; survey instrument. The developed instrument was intended to collect the; following type of data: demographic data, data on small business activities and; Likert scale data on small business support.; The validation of the questionnaire items presented in the Likert scale format was; done using factor analysis, a statistical procedure for synthesising large amounts; of data. The results of the factor analysis scale revealed that finance and; accessibility of information are the most important factors of small business; support systems. Questionnaire validation through the use of factor analysis acknowledged the limitation of using a small sample, which renders factor; analysis results not fully reliable.; The determination of small business operators' perceptions on the importance of; different support systems was done using Thurstone's Law of Comparative; Judgement. The results of the Thurstone comparison are that access to; information, training and skills development, are the most important support; systems listed by the respondents.; Findings on the majority of respondents about business activities are:; • they sell their products in the local markets, were started before 1983, started; their businesses with the intention of becoming their own bosses.; • they operate within the inner cities and employ 1 to 49 employees.; • they have not been trained on how to operate a small business but also do; not think that training would enhance their managerial performance.; The main Substantive findings of perceptions by the majority of operators about; small business support are that:; • they favour in-service/on hands training and business partnerships.; • believe that finance is the biggest problem facing small businesses.; • view most financial institutions as unsympathetic towards their needs.; •…",,,,,Likert scale; Data collection; Thurstone scale; Marketing; Political science; Systematic sampling; Judgement; Small business; Unemployment; Population; Management science,,,,,https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/51459,https://scholar.sun.ac.za/handle/10019.1/51459,,,2132365617,,0,,0

Although this method is promising in terms of obtaining reliable scores, empirical evidence concerning its validity is lacking. The current study examines implications resulting from two critical assumptions underpinning the use of comparative judgement, namely: its holistic characteristic and how the final rank order reflects the shared consensus on what makes for a good essay. Judges’ justifications that underpin their decisions are qualitatively analysed to obtain insight into the dimensions of academic writing they take into account. The results show that most arguments are directly related to the competence description. However, judges also use their expertise in order to judge the quality of essays. Additionally, judges differ in terms of how they conceptualise writing quality, and regarding the extent to which they tap into their own expertise.

Ideally, open and real-life tasks are used for such performance assessment. However, to augment the reliability of the scores resulting from performance assessment, assessments are mostly standardised. This hampers the validity of the performance assessment. Comparative judgement (CJ) is introduced as an alternative judging method that does not require standardisation of tasks. The CJ method is based on the assumption that people are able to compare two performances more easily and reliable than assigning a score to a single one. This chapter provides insight in the method and elaborates on why this method is promising to generate valid, reliable measures in an efficient way, especially for large-scale summative assessments. Thereby, this chapter brings together the research already conducted in this new assessment domain. </jats:p>",,,119,138,Competence (human resources); Psychology; Judgement; Medical education,,,,,https://www.igi-global.com/chapter/comparative-judgement-as-a-promising-alternative-to-score-competences/159970 https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:184261,http://dx.doi.org/10.4018/978-1-5225-0531-0.ch007,,10.4018/978-1-5225-0531-0.ch007,2485396921,,0,002-798-258-772-437; 008-661-505-775-063; 014-008-170-232-731; 015-610-828-146-943; 016-279-152-792-986; 016-352-031-372-553; 017-738-075-028-728; 018-269-445-638-29X; 020-492-282-615-504; 020-921-378-889-641; 021-738-595-719-412; 035-776-610-863-582; 037-416-173-942-082; 038-896-674-017-161; 041-210-265-147-079; 043-993-488-611-488; 045-627-278-090-39X; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 059-188-701-225-287; 059-647-472-149-611; 066-287-279-828-150; 066-908-670-161-319; 067-984-758-155-23X; 068-124-584-046-362; 069-107-065-440-634; 070-955-402-063-882; 076-050-960-166-845; 091-132-647-349-699; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-192-239-503-399; 105-060-972-080-52X; 106-532-502-155-602; 106-667-816-493-880; 107-790-959-417-375; 108-384-135-247-839; 115-102-354-884-075; 127-916-248-181-737; 143-327-887-855-405; 155-604-905-636-918; 156-536-166-107-928; 168-704-895-296-891; 177-072-688-486-223; 190-033-355-094-175; 199-435-723-761-218; 199-665-658-004-010,13

Rose; John D. Jasper; Ryan Corser,"Previous research has shown that people are egocentrically biased when making judgements that require a self-to-peer comparison – leading to above-/below-average effects and comparative optimism/pessimism. Two experiments examined whether interhemispheric brain connectivity (assessed via strength of handedness) is associated with egocentrism in the comparative judgement process. In Experiment 1, strong handers (SH) and mixed handers (MH) made percentile rank judgements about their abilities in easy and hard domains. In Experiment 2, SH and MH judged their likelihoods of outperforming a co-participant in easy and hard tasks. Both experiments showed that SH were more egocentric than MH and thus showed (a) more above- and below-average effects when estimating their abilities (Experiment 1) and (b) generally larger optimism biases when predicting performances in a competition (Experiment 2). Taken together, these experiments provide evidence that underlying interhemispheric connectivity shapes egocentrism in comparative judgement.",51,1,111,129,Chirality (physics); Developmental psychology; Psychology; Egocentrism; Optimism; Judgement; Social psychology; Percentile rank; Pessimism,,Analysis of Variance; Attitude; Brain/physiology; Defense Mechanisms; Female; Functional Laterality/physiology; Humans; Judgment/physiology; Male; Psychomotor Performance/physiology; Social Identification,,,https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x https://www.researchgate.net/profile/John_Jasper3/publication/50194963_Interhemispheric_interaction_and_egocentrism_the_role_of_handedness_in_social_comparative_judgement/links/0c96052c346b44b16b000000.pdf https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21348882,http://dx.doi.org/10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x,21348882,10.1111/j.2044-8309.2010.02007.x,1492817948,,0,001-249-077-153-794; 001-539-529-845-798; 001-808-120-697-091; 003-669-005-236-674; 004-688-760-041-053; 005-034-929-971-058; 006-981-763-398-491; 007-560-852-560-666; 007-778-725-444-103; 009-493-201-031-23X; 012-419-306-168-454; 014-419-216-898-317; 015-156-981-167-516; 016-096-789-488-138; 016-137-262-831-356; 017-870-813-973-309; 018-347-300-569-415; 018-412-222-408-808; 019-303-532-604-20X; 020-419-379-272-121; 022-187-949-595-874; 023-996-080-454-552; 025-291-229-702-511; 025-736-055-916-542; 029-209-500-575-442; 029-749-319-520-866; 032-104-735-088-638; 032-775-636-977-576; 032-799-942-231-090; 034-520-222-312-601; 037-674-524-591-483; 042-844-485-627-526; 043-341-357-838-945; 045-983-155-239-490; 048-587-072-525-736; 050-175-348-930-494; 053-640-820-450-620; 060-577-386-644-004; 061-082-122-262-098; 061-650-648-178-993; 062-431-143-205-980; 065-586-050-983-471; 066-608-905-207-154; 068-410-555-445-345; 069-040-474-230-271; 070-851-889-124-571; 074-038-324-174-292; 077-027-482-740-259; 078-837-899-642-591; 080-797-985-956-755; 082-662-120-833-072; 089-432-960-725-948; 101-407-970-642-140; 102-795-542-679-792; 105-433-720-062-009; 105-902-036-518-531; 107-601-077-156-243; 107-854-421-865-889; 109-607-523-283-358; 113-742-786-658-533; 114-590-207-496-477; 116-802-198-906-335; 120-458-466-449-922; 124-656-535-257-223; 133-444-859-830-606; 133-832-343-444-047; 136-272-860-034-114; 140-397-553-301-28X; 143-527-773-731-849; 167-796-474-873-982; 168-786-159-943-378; 180-077-537-443-884; 181-166-614-027-51X,9

Hierarchical regression results show that comparative judgements do not have any incremental effect in predicting job insecurity above self esteem. Self esteem predicts 21% variance in job insecurity.

While their over-riding expectation or hope is usually to enhance learning in a specific area, other possible outcomes may include reaching more students, providing experiences otherwise impossible, offering flexible access to a wider range of information, encouraging rehearsal and practice in virtual environments, the development of more generic skills - including the use of computers themselves. Unless these expectations are made explicit, the impact or effectiveness of the technological solution cannot be measured against its own goals. Ongoing evaluation in use can subsequently feed into quality improvement cycles.; ; In other situations, comparative judgements are sought but in many ways this approach is difficult. There is by no means agreement on the best methods of evaluation, even for the most basic of questions: Is the technology more effective in enhancing students' learning than are the alternatives it replaces? Is it cost-effective? Is it received better by the students? Conventional teaching methods have by no means always been evaluated rigorously, so the baselines for comparison are lacking or flawed. Complex variables (characteristics of the program in which the technology is embedded, students, teachers) inevitably confound any differences found, so absolute judgements are rarely possible.; ; Nevertheless, some strategies for evaluation have evolved and are often very effective within a local context.

Two aspects are quintessential for maximal learning outcomes among diverse learners: positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI). Consequently, this study validates an instrument to measure teachers’ reasoning with regard to PTSI and DI using explorative and confirmatory factor analyses. A total of 991 teachers and 3011 pre-service teachers indicated how crucial PTSI- and DI-arguments were in their comparative judgement of videoclips. Results show that the latent construct of PTSI consist of three subdimensions: individual needs, safe & structured environment, and student involvement. The latent construct of DI consists of four subdimensions: active learning, instructional clarity, adaptive teaching, and flexible grouping. The robustness of these findings across contexts demonstrates the centrality of these dimensions in teachers’ reasoning about inclusive classrooms.",67,,100912,,Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Active learning; Judgement; CLARITY; Notice; Differentiated instruction; Centrality; Physical education,,,,Agency for Innovation and Enterprise (VLAIO) from Flanders,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8672189 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191491X20301607,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.stueduc.2020.100912,,10.1016/j.stueduc.2020.100912,3046148393,,0,004-876-137-453-070; 004-945-538-115-570; 005-925-916-359-467; 007-598-909-438-594; 008-358-455-606-146; 009-148-822-033-388; 011-241-688-325-045; 011-395-301-396-730; 012-840-615-642-032; 013-149-886-595-274; 014-178-357-512-399; 015-967-135-935-271; 017-727-096-692-499; 018-104-018-970-17X; 018-866-489-276-134; 019-466-517-214-63X; 025-970-561-198-85X; 026-678-569-918-08X; 028-237-692-601-482; 030-619-394-339-83X; 032-113-282-979-159; 032-182-993-297-073; 035-325-670-176-458; 049-222-787-035-049; 054-661-068-596-232; 054-926-759-602-743; 058-351-505-190-778; 058-605-022-037-864; 064-731-590-809-679; 069-929-829-230-278; 070-070-847-038-059; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-527-957-682-219; 079-511-034-510-908; 079-827-807-232-315; 082-680-397-981-747; 084-735-998-604-515; 089-568-668-795-714; 098-583-662-995-899; 099-014-289-384-34X; 099-380-048-532-962; 103-241-685-940-304; 103-993-374-943-761; 107-600-359-892-383; 116-082-116-295-815; 116-953-447-460-185; 118-658-396-717-120; 123-048-918-232-925; 125-606-263-553-977; 125-894-267-538-829; 125-901-333-223-044; 126-292-923-823-985; 130-246-310-273-826; 132-784-070-412-495; 134-665-917-858-507; 135-089-625-164-101; 140-304-094-926-401; 142-295-997-236-840; 145-693-014-792-954; 149-065-448-470-82X; 149-255-225-240-75X; 149-796-004-088-960; 149-973-083-062-025; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 152-137-175-963-503; 155-395-601-295-319; 160-034-774-619-227; 162-442-188-512-684; 173-395-655-431-550,4

In 2010 European commission proposed the strategy Europe 2020 for smart, sustainable and inclusive growth and innovation plays the major role for its achievement. To track member states’ performance European Innovation Scoreboards (EIS) project is launched in 2011, which shows considerable differences in their innovation levels. Those differences are stable and cannot be explained within the framework of old-new members states, which gives us a reason to explore alternative paths. This paper suggests the thesis that culture could be viewed as a determinant of successful national-level innovation performance.

133-208-059-025-735,Online moderation of external assessment using Pairwise Judgements,2016-08-09,2016,,,,,,Christopher P Newhouse; Pina Tarricone,"When an assessment involves judgement by more than one assessor, it is usual to consider that some form of moderation is required to ensure consistent results. This often involves face-to-face meetings to compare judgements, and agree upon a score or grade. As well as inconsistency between assessors there is typically substantial error due to inconsistency in judgement between student performances by individual assessors. This is particularly the case where judgements are necessarily highly subjective. The traditional forms of moderation tend to be logistically difficult and analytical scoring using devices such as rubrics make generating reliable scores difficult. It is likely that problems such as these can be tackled using modern technologies, a thesis that we set out to investigate in the final phase of a three-year project into summative assessment in senior secondary schooling.  The study investigated the use of digital technologies to support a form of social online moderation, which involved the use of digital communications and assessment tools to facilitate a pairwise comparative judgement approach. It involved a small group of Visual Arts teachers from rural schools in Western Australia assessing digitised forms of artworks submitted for high-stakes summative assessment at the end of Year 12. The aim was to determine whether the use of these technologies would provide good moderation outcomes and valuable professional learning for those involved. The participants were guided through the processes that involved no face-to-face meetings and were questioned about their experiences of these processes and technologies, and their attitudes and perceptions of them. In addition the scores from their judgements were analysed. The results demonstrated that it was feasible to use these technologies to support moderation processes under these circumstances. Further participants perceived that the social online moderation processes supported by the technologies had assisted them in making more consistent judgements and increasing their understanding of the standards of work submitted and the application of the assessment criteria. They found the comparative judgement approach easy to use and appropriate for assessing the highly subjective artworks. However, the study found that probably due to the inexperience of some of the assessors the reliability of the final scores was not as high as anticipated. As a result a slightly more rigorous method for social online moderation is recommended by the study.",,,,,Rubric; Summative assessment; Psychology; Professional learning community; Pairwise comparison; Perception; Judgement; Applied psychology; Social psychology; Moderation,,,,,http://ro.ecu.edu.au/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4022&context=ecuworkspost2013 https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/3016/ https://works.bepress.com/pina_tarricone/24/,https://ro.ecu.edu.au/ecuworkspost2013/3016/,,,2467648677,,0,013-478-726-487-335; 015-818-297-478-879; 027-259-331-943-947; 048-091-210-665-560; 097-276-124-595-664; 155-610-667-713-754; 163-379-589-157-078,0

Comparative judgement requires no rubrics and is instead grounded in experts making pairwise judgements about the relative ‘quality’ of students’ work according to a high level criterion.

Cited benefits of comparative judgement over traditional methods include increased reliability, validity and efficiency of assessment processes. We investigated whether such claims apply to summative statistics and English assessments in New Zealand. Experts comparatively judged students’ responses to two national assessment tasks, and the reliability and validity of the outcomes were explored using standard techniques. We present evidence that the comparative judgement process efficiently produced reliable and valid assessment outcomes. We consider the limitations of the study, and make suggestions for further research and potential applications.",55,1,49,71,Statistics; Rubric; Statistical model; Summative assessment; Task analysis; Pairwise comparison; Judgement; Evaluation methods; Computer science,,,,,https://repository.lboro.ac.uk/articles/journal_contribution/Assessment_by_comparative_judgement_an_application_to_secondary_statistics_and_English_in_New_Zealand/12052776 https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1256401 https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40841-020-00163-3 https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s40841-020-00163-3.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s40841-020-00163-3,,10.1007/s40841-020-00163-3,3015795228,,0,009-486-832-701-513; 014-392-940-528-758; 016-279-152-792-986; 019-011-529-322-629; 022-445-591-735-121; 022-486-381-437-418; 024-485-502-565-431; 025-448-910-847-271; 033-896-251-435-132; 035-776-610-863-582; 040-241-846-826-833; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-151-229-726-003; 053-594-557-048-313; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-908-670-161-319; 080-111-772-128-72X; 094-711-115-442-10X; 100-687-607-260-140; 107-790-959-417-375; 122-448-167-938-324; 126-454-221-798-016; 131-718-541-088-715; 131-849-599-517-076; 139-343-106-919-900; 148-673-033-661-432; 157-176-270-079-488; 164-086-224-126-233; 174-885-774-292-15X; 176-786-786-040-880; 188-006-649-973-495; 195-364-855-866-803,0

Wiley,Abstract This paper examines the use of Choice Based Conjoint experimentation for forecasting demand for a new restaurant category. The results of the forecasting experiment are compared to demand for existing restaurant categories to determine whether the choice experiment replicates actual category shares in the sampled region. The analysis shows that Choice Based Conjoint experiments are able to predict category shares for existing restaurant categories. It is then shown how the approach may be used to estimate demand for a new category.,6,3,63,78,Market segmentation; Economics; Marketing; Microeconomics; Demand forecasting; Choice based conjoint; Conjoint analysis,,,,,http://dro.deakin.edu.au/eserv/DU:30073874/dubelaar-applyingchoice-2001.pdf https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/abstract/20013055130 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1300/J038v06n03_05 https://www.cabdirect.org/abstracts/20013055130.html http://dro.deakin.edu.au/view/DU:30073874 http://www.dx.doi.org/10.1300/J038v06n03_05,http://dx.doi.org/10.1300/j038v06n03_05,,10.1300/j038v06n03_05,2161217282,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 003-341-906-053-921; 003-939-760-735-714; 017-732-979-943-710; 022-622-766-755-111; 035-776-610-863-582; 036-514-360-551-987; 050-943-988-713-681; 053-721-445-397-227; 057-657-809-679-383; 059-665-470-130-801; 076-743-222-996-152; 092-474-419-202-077; 104-254-290-802-635; 104-299-174-213-795; 114-685-371-109-418; 126-228-529-644-878; 163-825-847-404-551; 166-420-281-978-911; 194-756-375-036-196,1

Yellott,"Luce's Choice Axiom (LCA) is a hypothesis about probabilistic choice behavior (leading to a mathematical model) due to R. D. Luce. It envisions a situation in which an individual makes repeated choices from a set A containing N alternatives: A={a1, …, aN} (e.g., N restaurants). On each occasion exactly one alternative is selected. Sometimes all N alternatives are available for selection (all the restaurants are open); on other occasions only subsets of A are available (some restaurants are closed). P(i; A) denotes the probability that ai is chosen when all of A is available; P(i; S) is the probability that ai is chosen when the available set of alternatives is S⊆A. What is the relationship between P(i; S) and P(i; A)? LCA is the assumption that P(i; S) equals the conditional probability that ai is chosen from the full set A, given that the choice from A belongs to subset S. The article deals with: (a) testable predictions of LCA (e.g., the constant ratio rule: for all i≠j and S⊆A, P(i; S)/P(j; S)=P(i; A)/P(j; A)), (b) the empirical validity of LCA, (c) relationships between LCA and other models for choice behavior: Thurstone's ‘Law of Comparative Judgement,’ Tversky's ‘Choice by Elimination’ model, McFadden's ‘Multinomial Logit’ and ‘Generalized Extreme Value’ models, and (d) extension of LCA to preferences expressed by rank ordering.",,,9094,9097,Multinomial logistic regression; Econometrics; Thurstone scale; Axiom; Generalized extreme value distribution; Judgement; Luce's choice axiom; Mathematics; Conditional probability; Probabilistic logic,,,,,https://escholarship.org/uc/item/02b7s10w https://escholarship.org/uc/item/02b7s10w.pdf https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B0080430767006306,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/b0-08-043076-7/00630-6,,10.1016/b0-08-043076-7/00630-6,1941560889,,0,034-354-686-022-900; 035-776-610-863-582; 057-657-809-679-383; 058-310-338-398-932; 091-357-777-231-24X; 095-720-759-868-465; 111-358-495-245-06X,2

G. Okeola; B. F. Sule,"Abstract The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to study the urban water supply scheme for Offa, in Kwara State, Nigeria. The Offa water works is studied with the model so as to assist its future operation and the design of alternative system improvement works. AHP, a technique used in Multicriteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) had made important contribution to the practical decision making process by recognizing the decision makers (DMs) experience and in providing the possible best compromised solution in terms of multiple objectives and multiples DMs and stakeholders preferences. The study introduces three management options that are formulated on the prevailing nation’s water supply sector and foreign countries models. The three options are respectively: Public Ownership and Operation; Public Ownership and Private Operation; and Private Ownership and Operation. The stakeholders have chosen option 1 (Public Ownership and Operation) as most contributing to sustainable operation of an urban water supply service delivery under scrutiny of environmental, economical, technical, institutional, and socio-cultural criteria. The choice of option 1 reaffirms the stakeholder opinion in the survey that they did not want government to abandon their responsibility in the water sector. The ranking of the choice is based on the compromise solutions according to the performance of the system under various alternatives that are considered and the preference of the decision makers (DMs) or stakeholders on Performance Indicators or Measures (PIs or PMs). Subsequently, the AHP framework is more valuable and effective in facilitating an explorative insight into the problem.",24,1,19,24,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Decision-making; Environmental economics; Performance indicator; Business; Government; Stakeholder; Management science; Service delivery framework; Analytic hierarchy process; Water supply,,,,,https://www.researchgate.net/profile/B_Sule/publication/257451256_Evaluation_of_management_alternatives_for_urban_water_supply_system_using_Multicriteria_Decision_Analysis/links/55c3627d08aeb975673f0b15.pdf?origin=publication_list https://core.ac.uk/display/82805139 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1018363911000614 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/82805139.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jksues.2011.07.004,,10.1016/j.jksues.2011.07.004,1991613310,,0,007-882-319-771-256; 017-567-746-541-001; 024-759-467-275-062; 036-228-300-327-150; 043-294-249-724-191; 062-918-551-069-388; 090-090-921-634-435; 091-044-846-799-895; 109-322-602-752-803; 129-079-639-740-695; 166-741-898-052-139; 179-934-687-055-666,33

A large number of observers need to perform an LCJ evaluation in order to get accurate results. LCJ also does not provide an absolute scale of performance, nor does it provide a metric to evaluate the accuracy of the evaluation. Abovementioned shortcomings were addressed using AHP. The AHP was used to evaluate the effectiveness of camouflage patterns printed on fabric. The camouflage uniforms were presented to a panel of observers two at a time. The observers scored the effectiveness according to a scale provided. This data was then used to calculate the relative effectiveness values in order to rank the patterns from the best to the worst performer.

However, this design is impractical in many situations, especially in online auction environments where consumers cannot be asked to make comparisons before they make estimates. This study suggests and validates an alternative experimental design where no comparison process is needed to induce anchoring bias. Moreover, we postulate that repeated occurrence of anchoring points affect the strength of the anchoring effect on participants' price estimates. Two experiments were conducted to investigate the anchoring effect in both two-stage and one-stage designs. The results showed that the anchoring effect was robust under two-stage design, and repeated occurrence of the anchor did not reinforce the anchoring effect. Moreover, people's price estimates are susceptible to the anchoring effect even when they were not asked to make a comparative judgement before they determine the final estimate. However, the anchoring effect can be further consolidated when the anchor appears three times rather than once. Experimental design introduced in study 2 provides a promising website design direction and we suggest that high anchors should be embedded in a web page repeatedly to influence the buyers' value estimates to produce a premium.",27,1,31,42,Human–computer interaction; Engineering; World Wide Web; Information system; Anchoring; Web page; Judgement; Website design; Laboratory experiment; Online auction; E-commerce,,,,,https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1080/01449290600874998 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/journals/behaviourIT/behaviourIT27.html#WuCL08 https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01449290600874998 https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1451114 https://doi.org/10.1080/01449290600874998,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/01449290600874998,,10.1080/01449290600874998,2038886144,,0,005-553-153-856-945; 005-647-092-865-887; 014-991-755-969-177; 021-643-430-658-55X; 023-005-452-624-875; 029-207-492-909-748; 038-189-190-630-223; 057-561-524-688-298; 063-793-155-762-965; 067-869-375-985-814; 068-785-424-765-913; 085-271-493-217-441; 090-060-639-887-992; 099-080-524-853-608; 105-638-537-991-116; 111-347-097-082-548; 117-150-305-299-565; 124-538-751-952-258; 129-448-954-957-81X; 130-971-600-994-543; 132-914-230-472-749; 134-875-956-046-363; 147-470-185-440-763; 148-223-435-969-407; 153-673-590-545-62X,15

The categorisation according to SDs makes osteoporosis a rather unique case within the medical world of risk definitions. We invited women who had their bone mass scanned in the Nord-Trondelag Health Study (HUNT) to participate in focus groups and share their scanning experiences.

Motivating students to explore and establish what is of value in their subject domain is a significant challenge facing academics and practitioners alike. Williams (2009) presents design based technology education as being embedded in the personal and social context of the student, where the value of what is being learned is as important as the content itself. Design based tasks have the potential to encourage students to establish and make explicit their views and beliefs. Requiring students to establish their own assessment criteria introduces uncertainty, risk, and confusion into the process of learning. Establishing what is of value now becomes the primary concern for the learner in a quest to demonstrate their capability within a personal view of the subject domain. This study implemented a constructivist approach to learning in a design based task focused on the development of design, craft and processing skills. The method employed a peer assessment strategy through the use of an Adaptive Comparative Judgement (ACJ) model of assessment that required students to democratically assess the work of their peers. Assessment criteria were not made explicit, as students were encouraged to present their own conception of capability developed throughout the learning activity. The significance of the study was highlighted by the reaction of the students to their dual role as learner and assessor and how this affected their learning. The empirical evidence collected highlights the importance of empathy as a mediator when developing critical reflective practise. The study outlines the cultural impact of democratic peer assessment on initial teacher education students while establishing what to value within their subject domain.",,073,119,125,Mathematics education; Empirical evidence; Political science; Adaptive comparative judgement; Constructivist teaching methods; Craft; Empathy; Teacher education; Peer assessment; Technology education,,,,,https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/073/014/ecp12073014.pdf https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=073;article=014,https://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_article/index.en.aspx?issue=073;article=014,,,2289784600,,0,002-081-620-058-378; 003-019-903-218-043; 010-084-583-635-941; 030-886-013-118-037; 046-440-857-440-08X; 060-586-982-949-626; 063-199-705-126-655; 071-837-551-305-725; 098-490-797-549-316; 114-331-251-470-403; 115-862-167-238-600; 120-588-342-597-419; 127-553-827-929-797; 128-554-891-964-037; 168-704-895-296-891; 182-654-317-262-088,2

Two different print size Kana words which represented concrete objects were paired and displayed tachistoscopically to the left or the right visual field. Subjects decided if the relationship of the print size and real life size of the word pairs was appropriate or not by pressing a key. Results revealed that female subjects showed faster reaction times to the right visual field stimulation while males showed a tendency toward a left visual field superiority. Possible hemisphere difference in mechanisms between the sexes were discussed.,16,2,83,86,Developmental psychology; Psychology; Kana; Cognitive psychology; Semantic memory; Visual field; Judgement; Hemispheric asymmetry; Right visual field,,"Brain Mapping; Dominance, Cerebral/physiology; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Judgment; Language; Male; Psycholinguistics; Reading; Sex Factors; Size Perception/physiology; Visual Fields",,,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7166466,http://dx.doi.org/10.3109/00207458209147608,7166466,10.3109/00207458209147608,2036491860,,0,011-669-593-600-689; 018-284-024-823-628; 020-162-620-645-078; 031-972-241-656-088; 049-462-446-919-236; 053-410-042-062-854; 055-055-718-253-167; 055-762-311-968-42X; 083-224-090-734-642; 089-150-843-291-794; 110-264-819-452-302; 126-294-432-927-13X,1

The research shows how teachers’ work is connected to chains of texts that link education data to funding and performance management. While public and institutional discourses suggest teachers make individual decisions to “teach to the test” in response to high stakes testing, this research demonstrates that significant aspects of teachers’ work both in and out of the classroom are orchestrated by series of policy texts that flow from governments to bureaucrats and ultimately into schools",,,,,,,,,,https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/83150972.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.5204/thesis.eprints.104977,,10.5204/thesis.eprints.104977,,,0,,0

R. Simpson; Gerard Roma; Emad M. Grais; Russell Mason; Christopher Hummersone; Mark D. Plumbley,"Source separation evaluation is typically a top-down process, starting with perceptual measures which capture fitness-for-purpose and followed by attempts to find physical (objective) measures that are predictive of the perceptual measures. In this paper, we take a contrasting bottom-up approach. We begin with the physical measures provided by the Blind Source Separation Evaluation Toolkit (BSS Eval) and we then look for corresponding perceptual correlates. This approach is known as psychophysics and has the distinct advantage of leading to interpretable, psychophysical models. We obtained perceptual similarity judgments from listeners in two experiments featuring vocal sources within musical mixtures. In the first experiment, listeners compared the overall quality of vocal signals estimated from musical mixtures using a range of competing source separation methods. In a loudness experiment, listeners compared the loudness balance of the competing musical accompaniment and vocal. Our preliminary results provide provisional validation of the psychophysical approach.",,,211,221,Deep learning; Blind signal separation; Psychophysics; Artificial intelligence; Perception; Source separation; Speech recognition; Perceptual similarity; Computer science; Loudness,,,,,https://rd.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-319-53547-0_21 https://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/conf/ica/ica2017.html#SimpsonRGMHP17 https://core.ac.uk/display/76989331 https://pure.hud.ac.uk/en/publications/psychophysical-evaluation-of-audio-source-separation-methods http://epubs.surrey.ac.uk/813113/1/Psychophysics%20for%20source%20separation_CAMERA_READY.pdf https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007%2F978-3-319-53547-0_21 https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/76989331.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-53547-0_21,,10.1007/978-3-319-53547-0_21,2588283911,,0,001-493-640-192-747; 005-316-984-965-713; 008-820-517-747-743; 009-121-175-832-625; 010-119-655-588-310; 015-920-420-907-984; 024-937-288-044-794; 028-640-991-836-177; 042-941-290-169-160; 044-799-053-499-156; 070-363-155-602-180; 078-895-573-347-635; 078-918-802-760-933; 085-173-753-122-184; 091-157-252-812-651; 095-071-167-249-954; 119-880-828-523-076; 178-988-828-462-693,1

A number of access control techniques are considered and a comparative analysis conducted to select the ""best"" concept for a particular set of requirements and decision criteria. The communication traffic analysis used in this study is a composite taken from several requirements analyses conducted to date. The results of the Automated Marine International Study for the Coast Guard (Coast Guard Contract DOT-CG-00505A) was essentially the source document for the requirements postulated for 1980. The general characteristics of a number of candidate techniques are developed in the MARSAT application. The selection of a ""best solution"" to the MARSAT access control problem is based on comparative judgement of qualitative measures. These measures are particularly the user terminal impact in terms of the hardware and workload impact of the user. Additional considerations unique to each technique considered have been commented on and used in making the final judgement.",1,,,,Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Communications satellite; Engineering; Judgement; Satellite system; Workload; Traffic analysis; Coast guard; Computer security; Operations research; Access control,,,,,https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=10305,https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=10305,,,647041936,,0,,0

Connecting teachers’ beliefs about teaching diverse learners to their noticing of inclusive classroom characteristics in videoclips,,2019,journal article,Contemporary Educational Psychology,0361476x; 10902384,Elsevier BV,United States,Iris Roose; Wendelien Vantieghem; Ruben Vanderlinde; Piet Van Avermaet,"Abstract Insight in the way teachers' beliefs filter their interpretation of inclusive classrooms is vital to support teachers’ competences to teach diverse learners. This study explores how three types of teacher beliefs about teaching diverse learners (i.e., professional beliefs about diversity, beliefs about differentiating the curriculum, and growth mindset) are associated with their noticing of two key aspects of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data was collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (N = 462) in Flemish schools (N = 23). Teacher beliefs were measured by survey scales, while teachers’ noticing of PTSI and DI was assessed by a standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument. Survey and video data were combined in a multivariate multilevel framework. Findings indicate that teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity and beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as filters for noticing PTSI and DI in videoclips. For teachers’ growth mindset no significant relationship was found. These associations did not change when taking into account teachers’ sex, age, educational background or experience. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers’ noticing DI is explained by the school level, suggesting that teachers within a school can share a vision. Results are discussed in the light of teacher thinking for inclusive classrooms and implications for teacher professional development.",56,,140,151,Competence (human resources); Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Judgement; Flemish; Mindset; Differentiated instruction; Curriculum; Professional development,,,,Agentschap Innoveren en Ondernemen,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0361476X18302807 https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8588431,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002,,10.1016/j.cedpsych.2019.01.002,2907292383,,0,000-056-946-438-568; 001-130-814-749-478; 001-816-199-374-497; 003-188-947-757-126; 004-945-538-115-570; 005-925-916-359-467; 006-475-855-411-188; 007-008-789-576-294; 007-222-148-199-465; 007-238-613-398-889; 007-598-909-438-594; 007-605-631-008-014; 009-148-822-033-388; 009-631-573-859-890; 011-241-688-325-045; 012-460-221-586-897; 013-149-937-460-530; 014-178-357-512-399; 016-562-615-291-410; 019-466-517-214-63X; 020-037-705-548-725; 020-090-252-035-689; 020-410-993-470-16X; 023-076-111-489-079; 023-371-512-048-313; 025-970-561-198-85X; 028-780-018-707-570; 030-619-394-339-83X; 030-884-694-910-353; 032-182-993-297-073; 032-267-780-111-16X; 032-350-915-613-00X; 032-537-439-007-753; 034-308-442-497-566; 035-448-999-724-00X; 041-229-625-128-286; 043-543-260-262-498; 046-652-377-826-455; 047-503-393-805-643; 048-091-210-665-560; 048-238-801-487-157; 049-158-882-675-77X; 050-246-194-423-566; 053-527-559-301-001; 055-941-445-639-289; 056-856-051-276-163; 058-505-623-532-694; 058-605-022-037-864; 059-524-580-671-394; 061-635-915-999-601; 062-136-590-639-56X; 062-863-033-501-112; 066-657-378-420-21X; 069-929-829-230-278; 070-070-847-038-059; 070-118-044-620-088; 070-698-722-622-837; 071-897-195-080-287; 074-527-957-682-219; 079-561-893-442-216; 080-431-766-996-785; 081-990-827-471-155; 082-680-397-981-747; 087-996-569-717-41X; 090-297-325-685-656; 090-445-793-186-585; 091-513-087-045-089; 099-014-289-384-34X; 102-555-702-781-751; 103-241-685-940-304; 103-993-374-943-761; 105-948-724-703-144; 106-909-001-153-673; 118-658-396-717-120; 119-466-744-165-36X; 123-048-918-232-925; 125-606-263-553-977; 125-901-333-223-044; 127-659-660-814-933; 130-227-495-570-742; 132-079-116-330-337; 132-784-070-412-495; 132-882-893-998-203; 133-346-643-838-466; 135-089-625-164-101; 139-355-954-878-732; 140-843-764-687-773; 142-880-459-788-071; 142-987-562-942-313; 144-536-011-358-903; 149-973-083-062-025; 151-321-144-637-565; 152-010-395-956-534; 160-677-556-841-005; 167-564-741-478-934; 172-413-910-758-148; 174-464-917-438-828; 181-201-084-615-795; 192-368-533-735-324; 199-247-058-966-679,6

An expert study (n = 30) was set up to (1) investigate whether the selected videoclips elicit experts’ professional vision of two dimensions of effective inclusive classrooms, i.e., positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI); (2) to analyse whether experts come to a reliable consensus rank order of videoclips for PTSI and DI; (3) to explore whether the video-based assessment instrument is able to discriminate between the two dimensions of experts’ professional vision of inclusive classrooms under investigation; (4) to investigate which reasoning arguments on PTSI and DI are related to videoclips’ position in the rank order.

Very little use has been made of the information obtained in this process. Instead, research has focussed upon the analysis of health state valuation data obtained using the visual analogue scale, standard gamble and time trade off methods.; ; Thurstone’s law of comparative judgement postulates a stable relationship between ordinal and cardinal preferences, based upon the information provided by pairwise choices. McFadden proposed that this relationship could be modelled by estimating conditional logistic regression models where alternatives had been ranked. In this paper we report the estimation of such models for the Health Utilities Index Mark 2 and the SF-6D. The results are compared to the conventional regression models estimated from standard gamble data, and to the observed mean standard gamble health state valuations.; ; For both the HUI2 and the SF-6D, the models estimated using rank data are broadly comparable to the models estimated on standard gamble data and the predictive performance of these models is close to that of the standard gamble models. Our research indicates that rank data has the potential to provide useful insights into community health state preferences.

156-808-035-039-167,A Measure of Freedom,1999-03-25,1999,book,,,Oxford University Press,,Ian Carter,"When liberal political philosophers talk of equalizing, increasing or maximizing freedom (or liberty), they implicitly assume freedom to be a measurable attribute. Freedom is one of the currencies of a liberal theory of distributive justice, and is therefore assumed to be something that individuals can possess in varying degrees. Yet it is rarely clear what is meant by claims about degrees of freedom. To make sense of such claims, we need to clarify the concept of overall freedom and ask whether its measurement is theoretically possible. This concept is important because freedom has, for liberals, non-specific (or content-independent) value–i.e. value that is independent of the value of being free to do specific things. Liberals prescribe not only that individuals have certain specific freedom-types but also that they have a measure of (overall) freedom. Attempts to make sense of the concept of overall freedom by weighting particular options in terms of their values are erroneous, as these do not account for freedom’s non-specific value. On the other hand, a closer examination of the problems of the individuation of actions and of the various types of constraints on freedom shows overall freedom to be measurable in a way that reflects its non-specific value. To this end, actions need to be individuated in spatio-temporal terms and constraints on freedom need to be characterized in terms of the physical compossibility of actions. The comparative judgements about freedom implied by this analysis (with reference both to individuals and to groups) are more coherent with our intuitive judgements than might at first be expected.-- Introduction; -- Part I Justice and Overall Freedom; -- 1 The Concept of Overall Freedom; -- 2 The Value of Freedom; -- 3 The Distribution of Freedom; -- 4 Reflective Equilibrium; -- Part II Value-Based Freedom; -- 5 The Value-Based Approach; -- 6 Self-Mastery; -- Part III Empirical Freedom; -- 7 Individual Freedom: Actions; -- 8 Individual Freedom: Constraints; -- 9 Group Freedom; -- 10 Indicators of Freedom; -- ConclusionPublished version of EUI PhD thesis, 199",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/0198294530.001.0001,,10.1093/0198294530.001.0001,,,0,,151

A comparative-judgement study of students’ and mathematicians’ views,,2021,journal article,The Journal of Mathematical Behavior,07323123,Elsevier BV,United Kingdom,Ben Davies; Lara Alcock; Ian Jones,"Abstract We present a study in which mathematicians and undergraduate students were asked to explain in writing what mathematicians mean by proof. The 175 responses were evaluated using comparative judgement: mathematicians compared pairs of responses and their judgements were used to construct a scaled rank order. We provide evidence establishing the reliability, divergent validity and content validity of this approach to investigating individuals’ written conceptions of mathematical proof. In doing so, we compare the quality of student and mathematician responses and identify which features the judges collectively valued. Substantively, our findings reveal that despite the variety of views in the literature, mathematicians broadly agree on what people should say when asked what mathematicians mean by proof. Methodologically, we provide evidence that comparative judgement could have an important role to play in investigating conceptions of mathematical ideas, and conjecture that similar methods could be productive in evaluating individuals’ more general (mathematical) beliefs.",61,,100824,,Mathematical proof; Discriminant validity; Mathematics education; Psychology; Ranking; Judgement; Conjecture; Content validity,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0732312320300882 https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/id/eprint/10119188/,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jmathb.2020.100824,,10.1016/j.jmathb.2020.100824,3109266471,,0,000-160-682-576-472; 003-236-983-227-230; 003-489-443-706-914; 009-194-550-637-248; 010-429-522-282-274; 016-279-152-792-986; 019-737-685-768-000; 026-140-166-599-34X; 028-600-184-401-058; 029-674-735-548-346; 030-028-888-998-208; 037-550-015-414-716; 039-154-422-915-145; 040-241-846-826-833; 047-410-827-372-679; 047-880-503-988-078; 048-151-229-726-003; 048-157-976-249-914; 049-844-532-127-036; 051-564-843-867-774; 051-994-891-084-520; 052-556-386-273-247; 062-546-879-061-051; 066-564-379-087-831; 066-753-555-767-135; 067-022-905-420-746; 079-050-415-749-606; 090-794-868-877-416; 094-718-700-068-894; 102-955-514-174-383; 104-581-513-132-471; 108-549-236-916-870; 117-962-324-802-641; 122-448-167-938-324; 141-363-290-283-622; 169-639-186-979-268; 174-885-774-292-15X; 183-245-213-539-678; 183-648-179-920-825,0

Paul Newhouse,"In this paper we argue that comparative judgement delivered by online technologies is a viable, valid and highly reliable alternative to traditional analytical marking. In the past, comparative judgement has been underused in educational assessment and measurement, particularly in large-scale testing, mainly due to the lack of supporting technologies to facilitate the large number of judgements and judges. We describe the foundations of comparative judgement and dispel many of the old issues regarding its use in regards to time, cost and training for large-scale assessment.

We conceptualised this issue as one of problematic judgements by assessors. Existing literature and evidence about judgements within performance appraisal and impression formation, as well as the small evolving literature on raters? cognition within medical education, provided the theoretical context to study assessor?s judgement processes.Methods and Results: In this thesis we present three studies. The first study adopted an exploratory approach to studying assessors? judgements in direct observation performance assessments, by asking assessors to describe their thoughts whilst assessing standard videoed performances by junior doctors. Comments and follow up interviews were analysed qualitatively using grounded theory principles. Results showed that assessors attributed different levels of salience to different aspects of performances, understood criteria differently (often comparing performance against other trainees) and expressed their judgements in unique narrative language. Consequently assessors? judgements were comparatively idiosyncratic, or unique.The two subsequent follow up studies used experimental, internet based, experimental designs to further investigate the comparative judgements demonstrated in study 1. In study 2, participants were primed with either good or poor performances prior to watching intermediate (borderline) performances. In study 3 a similar design was employed but participants watched identical performances in either increasing or decreasing levels of proficiency. Collectively, the results of these two studies showed that recent experiences influenced assessors? judgements, repeatedly showing a contrast effect (performances were scored unduly differently from earlier performances). These effects were greater than participants? consistent tendency to be either lenient or stringent and occurred at multiple levels of performance. The effect appeared to be robust despite our attempting to reduce participants? reliance on the immediate context. Moreover, assessors appeared to lack insight into the effect on their judgements.Discussion: Collectively, these results indicate that assessors score variations can be substantially explained by idiosyncrasy in cognitive representations of the judgement task, and susceptibility to contrast effects through comparative judgements. Moreover, assessors appear to be incapable of judging in absolute terms, instead judging normatively. These findings have important implications for theory and practice and suggest numerous further lines of research.",,,,,Grounded theory; Psychology; Cognition; Salience (language); Impression formation; Narrative; Judgement; Performance appraisal; Direct observation; Medical education; Social psychology,,,,,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.576832 https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:186130,https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.576832,,,831620190,,0,,0

Judd,"In the present chapter we first review research that has identified two fundamental dimensions of social perception. Having defined these two dimensions, we then present the results of a research program conducted to explore the relationship between them. In general, using both experimental and correlational data, we find evidence of a compensation effect between the two dimensions when two targets are compared. That is, when one target is judged more positively on one of the two fundamental dimensions, the second is judged more positively on the other dimension. We show that this compensation effect is confined to these two fundamental dimensions rather than something that more broadly characterises comparative judgements on any two judgemental dimensions. We then explore the importance of this compensation effect for the formation, maintenance, confirmation, and communication of mixed stereotypes of social groups.",21,1,155,187,Competence (human resources); Social perception; Psychology; Social compensation; Social comparison theory; Social group; Research program; Compensation effect; Social psychology; Social skills,,,,,https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13546805.2010.517997 https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-26750-005 https://perso.uclouvain.be/vincent.yzerbyt/Kervyn%20et%20al.%20ERSP%202010.pdf https://dial.uclouvain.be/pr/boreal/object/boreal:80948,http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/13546805.2010.517997,,10.1080/13546805.2010.517997,2106393606,,0,004-036-447-460-418; 004-474-032-379-466; 005-082-717-189-239; 006-783-939-346-007; 007-109-056-549-339; 007-295-628-866-21X; 008-347-948-216-943; 009-307-985-057-945; 009-483-259-196-994; 011-782-130-252-133; 012-213-004-280-64X; 012-560-811-148-828; 014-499-853-704-178; 018-797-152-471-288; 019-248-044-554-89X; 019-379-391-788-607; 023-537-627-321-057; 025-274-180-646-752; 029-291-085-676-195; 030-920-314-889-819; 033-126-433-640-240; 033-713-603-925-676; 034-273-020-391-932; 035-958-373-578-83X; 037-789-950-331-027; 038-199-658-596-841; 045-133-003-831-726; 046-757-684-755-547; 049-166-209-469-773; 049-563-284-942-97X; 049-658-609-563-831; 051-552-239-824-876; 054-225-035-623-563; 054-265-013-339-031; 057-540-609-484-902; 062-420-560-074-770; 068-095-735-045-632; 073-811-228-464-205; 077-374-129-751-658; 078-855-076-404-25X; 084-171-413-768-581; 089-637-653-830-640; 091-409-396-377-132; 094-348-194-477-04X; 095-970-610-959-053; 097-565-160-854-409; 108-908-502-536-662; 109-760-962-476-435; 110-377-093-995-148; 112-496-512-669-959; 113-722-754-419-628; 115-891-977-840-866; 121-996-842-851-355; 135-174-291-025-377; 148-696-307-259-101; 150-285-617-553-993; 154-610-500-266-714; 166-445-955-811-351; 186-467-343-182-948; 192-076-021-893-666; 192-105-867-714-203; 197-151-224-677-129,85

The children were either academically, musically or artistically gifted, and there were two forms of the task. In one, a picture was followed by a sentence, and in another, one sentence was followed by another. Subjects had to decide as quickly as possible whether or not the second proposition logically confirmed the first. In the picture-sentence condition results from all groups could be fitted to the constituent comparison model for sentence verification proposed by Carpenter and Just (1975). For the sentence-sentence condition, however, the observed results diverged from those predicted by the model. The results are explained in terms of different degrees of linguistic processing capacities of the subjects, and they demonstrate the importance which verbal-logical congruence has for children.

This study observes two first year modules of the undergraduate programmes that focused on the development of subject knowledge and practical craft skills. Broadening the educational experience and perspective of students to include design based aptitudes demanded a clear aligning of educational approaches with learning outcomes. As design is a complex iterative learning process it requires a dynamic assessment tool to facilitate and capture the process. Considering the critical role of assessment in the learning process, the study explored the relevance of individual student-defined assessment criteria and the validity of holistic professional judgement in assessing capability within a design activity. The kernel of the paper centres on the capacity of assessment criteria to change in response to how students align their work with evidence of capability. The approach also supported peer assessment, where student-generated performance ranks provided an insight into not only how effectively they evidenced capability but also to what extent their peers valued it. The study investigated the performance of 137 undergraduate teachers during an activity focusing on the development of design, processing and craft skills. The study validates the use of adaptive comparative judgement as a model of assessment by identifying a moderate to strong relationship with performance scores obtained by two different methods of assessment.

This question is approached through an examination of three distance teaching universities: the British Open University (OU), the Spanish Universidad Nacional de Educacion a Distancia (UNED), and the Portuguese Universidade Aberta (UA).; ; A socio-cultural analysis explores the history, philosophical assumptions and applications of educational technology at each of the universities. Thus educational technology and distance education are discussed as interdependent and overlapping concepts. The socio-cultural approach is applied within a multi-modal systems theoretical framework. Along with these, the concept of world-view in intercultural communication is of central importance.; ; On the basis of this theoretical scaffolding the research has sought to avoid any comparative judgements of the relative 'superiority vs. inferiority' of the various distance teaching universities that might hinder meaningful interactions among them. As a qualitative inquiry the research rejects models and attitudes of assimilation ('cultural domination' or 'sub-cultural imperialism') and seeks to show the value of dialogue between, and the recognition of diversity among, the participating institutions.; ; Field work, including interviews and documentary analysis, has been conducted at the three major sites: Lisbon, Madrid and Milton Keynes. The interview data has been analysed using the GABEK (Ganzheitliche Bewaltigung von Komplexitat - Holistic Processing of Linguistically Represented Complexity) method. The analysis not only identified a number of key issues about educational technology and distance education, from a multicultural perspective, but it also gave rise to a new definition of educational technology in terms of curriculum and power.; ; The social function, along with the academic raison d'etre of these institutions, has been further explored and contextualised. Among the prominent topics that emerge from the various analyses is that of ethics: a relatively unexamined area in the field of distance education and educational technology. An effort has been made to introduce ethical concerns on the agenda for reflection among educational technologists and distance educational practitioners. I suggest that this topic has special relevance both to international collaborations and to the current engagement of the three universities in question with the promotion of distance education in developing countries. Finally, a proposal for the building up of communities of discourse in distance education in the various languages of this research is discussed.",,,,,Sociology; Educational technology; Interdependence; Pedagogy; Intercultural communication; Portuguese; Curriculum; Distance education; Multiculturalism; Developing country,,,,,http://oro.open.ac.uk/59384/ https://ethos.bl.uk/OrderDetails.do?uin=uk.bl.ethos.390812,http://oro.open.ac.uk/59384/,,,2152300304,,0,,0

De diversiteit in klaslokalen wordt nog intenser gegeven de context van een wereldwijde onderwijsevolutie naar meer inclusieve leeromgevingen. Dit proefschrift hanteert een brede definitie van 'inclusie' die verwijst naar het tegemoetkomen aan de behoeften van alle leerlingen voor wie eerlijke onderwijskansen een uitdaging zijn. ; ; In dit proefschrift stellen we dat leerkrachten hun situatie-specifieke vaardigheden (d.w.z., perceptie, interpretatie en beslissingsvermogen) de kern vormen van hun competentie om onderwijs inclusief af te stemmen op de diverse sterktes en behoeften van leerlingen. Dit proefschrift focust zich in het bijzonder op leerkrachten hun professionele visie van inclusieve klassen als een situatie-specifieke vaardigheid. Professionele visie wordt gedefinieerd als het vermogen om inclusieve klassituaties op te merken en deze vervolgens te interpreteren.; ; In onderwijskundige literatuur werd het concept professionele visie nog niet toegepast op inclusieve klassituaties. Er is bijgevolg ook geen meetinstrument om leerkrachten hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen mee in kaart te brengen. Daarom had dit proefschrift tot doel om leraren hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen te meten en onderzoeken. ; ; Enerzijds werd evidentie verzameld om de validiteit van een video-gebaseerd instrument te onderbouwen dat leerkrachten hun professionele visie meet op vlak van twee dimensies van effectieve inclusieve klassen: (1) positieve leerkracht-leerling interacties en (2) differentiatie. Het paarsgewijs vergelijken van video clips wordt wordt hierbij onderzocht als een holistisch en onbevooroordeeld alternatief voor gevestigde analytische meetmethoden die professionele visie kwantitatief in kaart brengen. ; Anderzijds werden leerkrachten hun paarsgewijze vergelijkingen van video clips in verband gebracht met hun overtuigingen over het lesgeven aan diverse leerlingen enerzijds en hun differentiatiepraktijk anderzijds. Op die manier trachtten we meer inzicht te krijgen in de wijze waarop professionele visie zich verhoudt tot andere aspecten van leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken. ; Hiertoe werden vier empirische studies opgezet: een mixed-method studie met experten (N=30) en 3 kwantitatieve studies met een steekproef van leerkrachten (N=360-400) uit het secundair onderwijs. ; ; Dit proefschrift verbreedt het methodologisch onderzoek omtrent kwantitatieve meetmethoden die professionele visie meten. De onderzoeksresultaten ondersteunen de validiteit van de paarsgewijze beoordelingsmethode om leerkrachten hun professionele visie op een holistische en onbevooroordeelde manier mee in kaart te brengen. De combinatie van paarsgewijze vergelijkingen van video clips om leerkrachten hun opmerkingsvermogen te meten met een analytische assessment van leerkrachten hun redeneringen over de vergelijkingen, zorgt ervoor dat de professionele visie van leerkrachten op een meer omvattende manier kan gemeten worden dan gevestigde video-gebaseerde kwantitatieve meetinstrumenten tot nu toe hebben gedaan. ; Daarnaast biedt dit proefschrift ook meer inzicht in leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken door hun professionele visie op inclusieve klassen in verbrand te brengen met andere competentie-aspecten zoals hun opvattingen over het lesgeven aan diverse leerlingen en hun differentiatiepratijk. De resultaten tonen aan dat leerkrachten hun opvattingen als filter werken op hun professionele visie en dat leerkrachten hun professionele visie ook gerelateerd is aan hun differentiatiepraktijk. De wijze waarop deze drie aspecten met elkaar in verband staan is echter complexer dan lineaire theoretische modellen suggereren.; ; Op basis van de inzichten uit dit proefschrift zien we team-gebaseerde professionele ontwikkeling, dat gebruik maakt van video-reflectie, als een veelbelovende methode om leerkrachten hun competentie om inclusief te werken te versterken",,,,,Art; Theology; Secondary education; Professional vision; Video based,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8680357,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8680357,,,3101426431,,0,,0

Seeger,"Materials data for cyclic loading are becoming increasingly important as a tool for materials characterization and engineering design. They can serve as the basis for a comparative judgement of a material's mechanical behaviour. Furthermore, knowledge of the stress-strain behaviour during cyclic loading is required more and more frequently in finite element calculations of cyclically loaded structural parts. Finally, such data are a fundamental input for the fatigue life estimation procedure known as the Local Strain Approach or Notch Strain Approach. Materials data for cyclic loading have been published in the scientific literature for many years, but have been collected in quite different ways. This is the first time that such data have been gathered together, evaluated according to uniform approach and methods, and compiled on standardised data sheets.

We then use the choice experiment method to examine public preferences for three landscape features – hedgerows, farm buildings and scrubland – in the Monts d’Arree region (in Brittany, France), in the context of re-design of landscape conservation policy by the local environmental institute. Surveys were undertaken on two user groups, visitors and local residents. Our objective was to obtain empirical evidence of the difference between the preferences of tourists and residents, for landscape attributes. We then analysed the welfare changes of tourists and residents affected by different landscape programmes. Our results point out the strong divergence between the landscape preferences of the public and those of local public actors. The comparison of the estimated values of willingness to pay for single-attribute landscaping action shows some divergence between residents’ and tourists’ ranking of preferences for agricultural landscape areas. Finally, we find, at least for the socio-economic context examined in this study, that apart from its social, cultural and aesthetic values, rural landscape has economic values, and that agricultural landscape preservation tends to be more beneficial to low-income social groups.",83,4,318,326,Welfare; Public opinion; Regional science; Empirical evidence; Landscaping; Social group; Land-use planning; Geography; Willingness to pay; Land use; Environmental protection,,,,,http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387 https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169204607001387 https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9225/1/Rambonilaza2.pdf https://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/9225/ https://core.ac.uk/download/pdf/12016547.pdf,http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,,10.1016/j.landurbplan.2007.05.013,2146957936,,0,001-362-199-882-05X; 003-659-907-827-298; 006-207-712-491-984; 010-195-457-296-442; 012-445-521-918-448; 031-810-415-073-770; 035-776-610-863-582; 041-684-051-531-053; 043-434-210-939-330; 043-572-477-925-718; 044-942-614-127-037; 049-910-359-846-40X; 051-613-010-997-062; 056-496-966-212-532; 057-657-809-679-383; 068-789-689-250-577; 071-674-642-056-169; 078-581-156-350-030; 088-659-729-299-827; 089-468-883-189-639; 091-917-222-986-705; 096-992-181-947-700; 100-440-892-234-712; 106-653-949-616-859; 107-781-135-837-372; 114-685-371-109-418; 116-662-795-910-859; 121-799-282-909-64X; 126-061-052-053-058; 130-282-073-277-329; 131-048-718-892-320; 134-772-380-318-431; 137-320-762-612-929; 147-824-212-663-256; 163-775-862-947-738; 168-106-348-621-405; 195-199-201-721-385,110

In contrast, comparative judgement studies suggest that it is possible to assess open ended tasks such as writing with greater reliability. Many previous studies, however, have failed to provide direct comparisons between these approaches as the reliability measures for rubric- and marking-based studies are not comparable with the internal measures of reliability cited by comparative judgement studies. We investigated the classification accuracy and consistency of a rubric-based approach to the grading of writing with a comparative judgement approach. The writing was gathered from 11-year-olds in low stakes settings in England. We present evidence that the comparative judgement approach has twice the classification accuracy as the rubric-based approach and is perfectly viable in terms of its efficiency. We discuss the limitations of the comparisons and consider what a national system for assessing writing based on a comparative judgement approach could look like.</p>",,,,,,,,,,,http://dx.doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/vzus4,,10.31235/osf.io/vzus4,,,0,,0

These competences are generally framed within worldwide policy initiatives towards more inclusive learning environments. This study explores how teachers’ beliefs about teaching diverse learners (i.e. teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity; teachers’ growth mindset; and teachers’ beliefs about differentiating the curriculum) affect teachers’ noticing of two aspects of effective inclusive classrooms (i.e. positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)). Data for this study was collected in a sample of secondary education teachers (n = 462) in 23 schools. An online survey was administered to measure teachers’ beliefs using standardised scales. A standardised video-based comparative judgement instrument was used to administer teachers’ noticing of PTSI and DI. A multivariate multilevel analytical framework allowed us to assess how teachers’ beliefs simultaneously affect two aspects of teachers noticing, being teachers noticing of PTSI and DI while taking into account both differences between teachers and schools. Findings from the analyses suggest that teachers’ professional beliefs about diversity and teachers’ beliefs about differentiating the curriculum serve as a filter for noticing both PTSI and DI. Furthermore, a small part of the differences in teachers’ noticing of DI relates to the school a teacher is working in. Findings of our study provide greater insight into teachers’ cognition of inclusive classrooms and have implications for the design of teacher professional development for inclusion.",,,,,Competence (human resources); Mathematics education; Inclusion (education); Psychology; Cognition; Judgement; Mindset; Differentiated instruction; Curriculum; Professional development,,,,,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8575561,https://biblio.ugent.be/publication/8575561,,,2901432727,,0,,0

This paper is concerned with investigating the ways in which accounting and accounting information has contributed to and shaped processes of organizational change in one area of the public sector, the ten Regional Water Authorities of England and Wales. In the early 1980s, the Water Authorities were subject to pressures from new Government financial controls and performance aims to become more efficient. These pressures intensified when the Government announced its intention to privatize them in 1986, and continued up to 1989 when privatization took effect. Since privatization the Water Authorities have been subject to “yardstick” competition under a new regulatory framework, and comparative judgements by the financial markets. In considering these changes, the paper examines the constitutive role of accounting in articulating changing organizational priorities, and in promoting first a vocabulary of costs and subsequently a vocabulary of profits as languages of organizational motive.",20,2,193,218,Private sector; Accounting; Public sector; Government; Economics; Accounting information system; Goods and services; Financial market; Accountability; Inefficiency; Market economy,,,,,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036136829595745I https://dialnet.unirioja.es/servlet/articulo?codigo=406320 https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/aosoci/v20y1995i2-3p193-218.html https://econpapers.repec.org/RePEc:eee:aosoci:v:20:y:1995:i:2-3:p:193-218 http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036136829595745I,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/036136829595745I,,,1991365596,,0,000-071-502-783-120; 004-056-537-312-433; 005-870-958-905-66X; 006-088-518-737-005; 007-796-148-351-562; 008-393-220-432-085; 014-435-091-060-106; 018-606-412-770-176; 021-216-199-367-701; 024-131-800-953-979; 025-703-767-860-355; 030-206-005-756-993; 031-627-527-306-756; 041-856-003-142-449; 043-376-377-523-22X; 055-302-707-947-37X; 055-776-463-078-159; 055-905-406-284-413; 059-807-367-812-389; 059-867-360-186-105; 062-169-328-024-94X; 068-934-262-106-97X; 069-208-229-469-656; 082-112-133-630-243; 083-043-456-641-529; 085-176-034-264-737; 087-894-962-010-878; 096-337-075-121-170; 109-038-213-914-049; 113-955-069-147-246; 119-229-194-605-922; 151-283-644-754-333; 153-228-322-528-502; 153-696-012-198-197; 161-186-777-375-239; 166-002-258-979-869; 167-104-436-386-841; 174-175-136-266-102; 175-576-864-376-151; 177-830-871-477-51X; 186-011-858-803-242; 191-843-768-382-192,131

Hal ini dikarenakan banyak terdapat kriteria yang berperan dalam persoalan tersebut. Apabila terdapat beberapa kriteria penilaian, proses pemilihan kriteria mana yang paling berperan untuk mengoptimalkan tujuan bukanlah suatu hal yang mudah dilakukan. Apalagi pada proses pengambilan keputusan penilaian dilakukan tidak hanya oleh satu orang ahli akan tetapi oleh beberapa pihak yang berkompeten dalam pengambilan keputusan. Dalam skripsi ini, akan dibahas pengambilan keputusan multikriteria dengan menggunakan metode Proses Hirarki Analisis (PHA) dan penerapan metode tersebut untuk mengetahui strategi pemasaran yang tepat untuk meningkatkan permintaan minyak goreng filma dari PT. Intermas Tata Trading. PHA menggunakan model hirarki yang terdiri dari tujuan, kriteria dan beberapa subkriteria serta alternatif untuk masing-masing permasalahan atau keputusan. PHA didasarkan atas empat prinsip dasar yaitu dekomposisi (decomposition), penilaian kriteria dan alternatif (comparative judgements), penentuan prioritas (synthesis of priority) dan konsistensi logis. PHA memperhitungkan pembobotan setiap kriteria secara konsisten sehingga dapat diketahui kriteria mana yang berperan untuk mengoptimalkan tujuan. Pembobotan kriteria pada PHA dilakukan dengan menggunakan matriks perbandingan berpasangan (pairwise comparison). Pembobotan dapat dilakukan dengan syarat matriks perbandingan konsisten. Matriks perbandingan akan konsisten apabila aturan transitivitas dan resiprokal terpenuhi. Strategi pemasaran pada PT. Intermas Tata Trading dianalisis menggunakan PHA. Hasil yang diperoleh dari pembobotan alternatif strategi pemasaran yang ada dengan menggunakan metode PHA dan proses pengolahannya dibantu dengan sofware Expert Choice version 9.0 adalah mengadakan promosi penjualan dengan nilai bobot prioritas terbesar yaitu 0,248 (24,8%) dan urutan program kerja untuk strategi tersebut adalah pemberian bonus sebesar 0,121 (12,1%), pemberian kupon sebesar 0,057 (5,7%), pemberian sampel sebesar 0,045 (4,5%), dan pemberian jaminan produk sebesar 0,025 (2,5%).",,,,,,,,,,http://eprints.uny.ac.id/1821/,http://eprints.uny.ac.id/1821/,,,1538362770,,0,,0
198-306-009-967-350,Applying the Law of Comparative Judement to Target Signature Evaluation,2000-03-01,2000,,,,,,James R. McManamey,"Abstract : The Law of Comparative Judgement (LCJ) is a psychophysical tool that can be used to scale complex phenomena that lack easily identified physical parameters. Target signatures represent such phenomena. In a demonstration exercise, a search difficulty"" value was found using the LCJ. These LCJ scale values were compared to search times and probabilities of detection from a search experiment run in the Netherlands. The scale values were not linearly related to search time and probability of detection, but correlated very well with the logarithm of mean search time (r = 0.936) and the cube of the number of correct responses (r = 0.954). A chi-squared goodness-of-fit test gave 94.6% confidence in the fit of the LCJ scale to the experimental data. While the LCJ results in a scale with no natural zero point and arbitrary units, this tool can be used to construct a standard scale: This paper illustrates how a standard clutter scale might be constructed using the LCJ. The LCJ could be a valuable tool in target signature evaluation either when used in conjunction with scaling equations that permit conversion to familiar quantities such as mean search time and probability of detection, by providing relative ""search difficulty"" values, or by making possible a psychophysically meaningful clutter scale.",,,,,Clutter; Scale factor; Psychophysics; Law; Target acquisition; Mathematics; Logarithm; Image processing; Statistical power; Scaling,,,,,,,,,246635540,,0,,0

This research aims to compare three water distillation systems and select the most sustainable water treatment option. A theoretical research is performed in this paper by a multi-objective analysis method with employing the realistic information from literature, author's judgement and available equations especially for costs. Due to the water and energy crisis in future and their dependency to each other, the application of renewable energy is considered in the assessment method for all three systems. Solar energy is preferred over wind or other types of sustainable energies as it can provide both electrical and heat energy. The three solar based water distillation systems examined in this study are categorised into solar vacuum membrane distillation (SVMD), solar multi-stage flash distillation (SMSFD) and solar direct contact membrane distillation processes (SDCMD). A Multi-Criteria Decision Analysis (MCDA) approach is developed to identify the most sustainable technology. Specifically, an Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) model is used to evaluate a treatment system against various sustainability criteria. Twelve sustainability indicators under three criteria groups are selected in the AHP model for pairwise comparison. The qualitative and quantitative indicators of environmental, economic, and social criteria have been used as a measure of sustainability for each of the water treatment processes. According to the analysis performed, the SVMD system is selected as the most sustainable system due to its weights obtained in comparative judgement of systems and total weight of indicators.",,,72,,Environmental resource management; Multiple-criteria decision analysis; Sustainable design; Engineering; Environmental economics; Multi-stage flash distillation; Renewable energy; Distillation; Solar energy; Sustainability; Analytic hierarchy process,,,,,https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=795071439136608;res=IELENG,https://search.informit.com.au/fullText;dn=795071439136608;res=IELENG,,,2293174748,,0,,1
