# Plans for CJ meta-analysis lit search

## Inclusion/exclusion criteria

TODO: flesh out the points made under Scope: https://github.com/georgekinnear/cj-meta-analysis/blob/main/README.md#scope

## Search strategy

Search on lens.org for keywords (this searches all fields, including title, abstract, keywords and full text):

- "comparative judgement"
- "comparative judgment"
- "pairwise comparisons"
- "paired comparisons"

Perhaps also search for work that cites:

- Thurstone, L. L. (1927). A law of comparative judgment. Psychological review, 34(4), 273.
  * (BUT: has about 7000 citations on Google Scholar!)
- Andrich, D. (1978). Relationships Between the Thurstone and Rasch Approaches to Item Scaling. Applied Psychological Measurement, 2(3), 451–462. https://doi.org/10.1177/014662167800200319
- Bradley, R. A., & Terry, M. E. (1952). Rank analysis of incomplete block designs: I. The method of paired comparisons. Biometrika, 39(3/4), 324.
- ...?


## Edge cases

What to do about these cases that are unusual?

* Roose, I., Vantieghem, W., Van Damme, K., Lambert, P., Vanderlinde, R., & Van Avermaet, P. (2019). Measuring teachers’ professional vision of inclusive classrooms through video-based comparative judgement. What does it mean to misfit?. International Journal of Educational Research, 98, 257-271.
  - Teachers did CJ on video clips of classroom episodes, deciding "which one is best with regard to two key aspects of inclusive classrooms: positive teacher-student interactions (PTSI) and differentiated instruction (DI)"
  - This is quite different to the scope we had in mind orginally, but now would be well within scope.

* Aaron Kaufman, Gary King, and Mayya Komisarchik. Forthcoming. “How to Measure Legislative District Compactness If You Only Know it When You See It.” American Journal of Political Science. Copy at https://j.mp/2Fs3ESc

  - This preprint uses paired comparisons to gather opinions about the "compactness" of different electoral districts.
  - It argues that paired comparisons are inadequate and instead has participants put a larger set of items into a rank order.
  - However it does report briefly on some pilot CJ studies (Appendix A) though does not report SSR.
